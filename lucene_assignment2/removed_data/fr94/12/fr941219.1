 In the notice of receipt for PRM-35-12 published on December 2, 1994 (59 FR 61831), the paragraph under
the heading, ``Benefits of the Test,'' revised to read as follows: 



The petitioner states that under the current regulations, the test is 95 percent accurate and quite inexpensive because
of its simplicity. The test would permit doctors to determine easily whether or not ulcer patients have been cured
of their infection. By providing the public with an inexpensive, easily accessible diagnostic test, more individuals
would be accurately diagnosed and treated for H.pylori infection. This would save the United States an estimated
$500 million per annum over conventional therapy.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt & Whitney JT8D series
turbofan engines, that would have amended an existing AD by eliminating an optional on-wing ultrasonic inspection
of the 10th stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk, and by including an engine model inadvertently omitted. That
proposal was prompted by a report of an uncontained failure of a 10th stage HPC disk that was previously inspected using
the on-wing ultrasonic inspection method. This action revises the proposed rule by removing the reference to the
inadvertently omitted engine model, as the FAA has remedied this discrepancy in an earlier correction to the AD, and
changing the proposed action from amending AD 81-08-02 R2 to superseding that AD. The actions specified
by this proposed AD are intended to prevent uncontained fractures of 9th through 12th stage HPC disks and engine failure.

Discussion



On February 7, 1984, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 81-08-02
R2, Amendment No. 39-4817 (49 FR 7361; February 29, 1984), to require initial and repetitive inspections of
9th through 12th stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disks at the tierod holes in Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series
turbofan engines. That action was prompted by cracks in the tierod holes in HPC disks that resulted in engine failures.
That condition, if not corrected, can result in uncontained fractures of 9th through 12th stage HPC disks and engine
failure.

On August 30, 1984, the FAA issued a correction to AD 81-08-02 R2, Amendment 39-4817 (49 FR 35618;
September 11, 1984), to include an engine model that had been inadvertently omitted from the AD.

Since issuance of AD 81-08-02 R2, the FAA received a report of an uncontained fracture of a 10th stage HPC
disk. This disk had been subjected to three previous on-wing ultrasonic inspections prior to fracture. This method
has since been determined as inadequate for detecting tierod hole cracking.

On May 8, 1989, the FAA issued an NPRM that was published in the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 22306; May 23, 1989), that would have amended the existing AD by eliminating the optional on-wing ultrasonic
inspection of the 10th stage HPC disk, and by including an engine model inadvertently omitted.

Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has determined that the reference to the inadvertently omitted engine model
was unnecessary, as the FAA had remedied this discrepancy in the August 30, 1984, correction. Also, the FAA now utilizes
a revised format that supersedes existing AD's by publishing a complete document rather than only amending applicable
paragraphs of the compliance section. This document, therefore, reprints the corrected AD compliance section text
in its entirety for clarity.

Since the FAA has changed the format of the proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is desirable to reopen the comment
period to provide additional opportunity for public comment.

There are approximately 200 engines which would be affected by this AD, and the FAA has determined that eliminating
the optional on-wing ultrasonic inspection would have negligible economic impact, since most operators use uninstalled
tenth stage disk inspections.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to supersede AD 88-11-05, which currently requires repetitively inspecting
the wing spar of Alexander Schleicher Models ASW-15 and ASW-15B gliders for wood rot, and replacing any
wing spar where wood rot is found. Alexander Schleicher 
Models ASW-12 and ASW-17 gliders are of a similar type 
design of the models affected by the current AD, and 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in working 
with the Civil Aviation Authority of Germany, has 
decided that the actions referenced in AD 88-11-05 
should also apply to these glider models. The actions 
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
failure of the wing spar caused by wood rot, which, if 
not detected and corrected, could result in loss of 
control of the glider.

Discussion



A report of an in-flight wing failure because of 
box spar wood rot on a Model ASW-15 glider that was 
certificated for operation in Australia prompted the 
FAA to issue AD 88-11-05, Amendment 39-5997. This AD 
requires repetitively inspecting the wing spar for wood 
rot on Alexander Schleicher Models ASW-15 and ASW-15B 
gliders that are certificated for operation in the 
United States, and replacing any wood wing spar where 
wood rot is found. These actions are accomplished in 
accordance with Alexander Schleicher ASW-15 Technical 
Note (TN) No. 23, dated April 21, 1988. 

The wing configuration of these gliders includes a 
wood box wing spar. Water can penetrate the box spar 
interior, which permits the growth of wood destroying 
mold fungus. This fungus could destroy the balsa wood 
spar webs and plywood blocks of the spar to the point 
where the residual spar strength would no longer be 
sufficient.

The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), which is the airworthiness authority for Germany, recently notified the FAA that
Alexander Schleicher Models ASW-12 and ASW-17 gliders contain a similar wing configuration. The LBA
advises that, if periodic inspections are not accomplished on the wing spar of the referenced gliders, then wood rot
could occur. This condition, if not detected and corrected, could result in failure of the wing spar and subsequent
loss of control of the glider.

Alexander Schleicher has issued ASW-12 TN No. 4, dated May 10, 1989, and ASW-17 TN No. 12, dated May 8, 1989,
which specify procedures for repetitively inspecting the wing spar on the Models ASW-12 and ASW-17 gliders.

This airplane model is manufactured in Germany and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LBA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the LBA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Alexander Schleicher Models
ASW-12, ASW-15, ASW-15B, and ASW-17 gliders of the same type design, the proposed AD would
supersede AD 88-11-05, Amendment 39-5997, with a new AD that would (1) retain the requirement of
repetitively inspecting the wing spar for wood rot on the Models ASW-15 and ASW-15B gliders, and replacing
the wing spar if wood rot is found; and (2) extend these repetitive inspections and possible replacement to Models
ASW-12 and ASW-17 gliders. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with either
Alexander Schleicher ASW-15 TN No. 23, dated April 21, 1988; Alexander Schleicher ASW-12 TN No. 4, dated
May 10, 1989; or Alexander Schleicher ASW-17 TN No. 12, dated May 8, 1989, as applicable.

The compliance time presented in the proposed AD is based upon calendar time instead of hours time-in-service. Rotting
of the wood wing box spar is caused by moisture and the condition could exist or develop regardless of whether the glider
is in actual operation. For this reason, the FAA has determined that the compliance time of the proposed AD action should
be in calendar time.

The FAA estimates that 50 gliders (7 ASW-12's, 27 ASW-15's, 6 ASW-15B's, and 10 ASW-17's) in
the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 workhours to accomplish
the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost approximately $110 per
glider, and the proposed core analysis would cost $185. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $32,750. This figure is based upon the assumption that no affected glider owner/operator
has accomplished the proposed inspection, nor does it account for repetitive inspections. The FAA has no way of determining
the number of repetitive inspections an owner/operator may incur.

In addition, AD 88-11-05 required the same actions as is proposed on 33 airplanes. With this in mind, the
cost impact of the proposed AD upon U.S. operators is reduced $21,615 from $32,750 to $11,135.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket

The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Colorado City, AZ. The effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators
executing the NDB approach at Colorado City, AZ. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American
Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as transition areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA
Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1.
The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. Therefore, this proposed
regulation_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant
rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation
of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Alabama abandoned mine land reclamation plan (hereinafter
referred to as the ``Alabama plan'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed
amendment consists of revisions and additions to the Alabama plan pertaining to the incorporation of contractor
bidder eligibility screening under OSM's Applicant Violator System for the reclamation of coal and noncoal sites;
exclusion of certain noncoal sites from reclamation; requirement of submission of Form OSM-76 upon project
completion; and, removal of the fourth priority for noncoal reclamation sites. These changes would be applicable
to reclamation of both nonemergency and emergency Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) projects. The amendment
is intended to revise the Alabama plan to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background on the Alabama Plan



Title IV of SMCRA established an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and water resources
adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the production of coal.
As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned
or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there was no continuing reclamation
responsibility under State or Federal law. The AML Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508, title VI, Subtitle
A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective Oct. 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1231 

et seq.,

 to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation
of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977. These include interim program sites where bond
forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977,
and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the
bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR plan has the responsibility and primary authority
to implement the program.

On May 20, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Alabama plan. Background information on the Alabama plan,
including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the plan can be found in the May
20, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 22062). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and amendments to the plan can be found at
30 CFR 901.25.

The Secretary adopted regulations at 30 CFR Part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation
plan and the criteria for plan approval. The regulations provide that a State may submit to the Director proposed amendments
or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope of major policies followed
by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14
in approving or disapproving an amendment or revision.



II. Description of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated December 5, 1994 (Administrative Record No. AL-512), Alabama submitted a proposed amendment
to its plan pursuant to SMCRA. Alabama submitted the proposed amendment in response to a September 26, 1994, letter
(Administrative Record No. AL-511) that OSM sent to Alabama in accordance with 30 CFR 884.15(d). The provisions
of the Alabama plan proposed for revision are ``Administrative and Management Structure of the Alabama Abandoned
Mine Land Reclamation Program Pursuant to 30 CFR Part 884.13(d)'' to incorporate contractor bidder eligibility
screening under OSM's Applicant Violator System for the reclamation of coal and noncoal sites; and ``Ranking and
Selection Procedures Pursuant to 30 CFR Part 884.13(c)(2)'' to exclude certain noncoal sites from reclamation;
to require submission of Form OSM-76 upon project completion; and, to remove the fourth priority for noncoal
reclamation sites. The changes would be applicable to reclamation of both nonemergency and emergency AMLR projects.

III. Public Comment Procedures


In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Alabama program.


Written Comments


Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Birmingham Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the Administrative Record.



Public Hearing



Persons wishing to speak at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4:00 p.m., E.S.T. on January 3, 1995. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to speak at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.

The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to speak have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to speak, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to speak and persons present in the audience who wish to
speak have been heard.
Any disabled individual who has need for a special accommodation to attend a public hearing should contact the individual
listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.



Public Meeting



If only one person requests an opportunity to speak at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing, may
be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

 All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES.

 A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the Administrative Record.



IV. Procedural Determinations

Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State and Tribal abandoned mine land reclamation
plans and revisions thereof since each such plan is drafted and adopted by a specific State or Tribe, not by OSM. Decisions
on proposed State and Tribal abandoned mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State or Tribe
as based on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231-1243)
and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 884 and 888.

National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State and Tribal abandoned
mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior [516 Dm 6, appendix 8, paragraph
8.4B(29)].



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). The submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant
economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for the corresponding Federal
regulations.

Polyalkylene Polyamine; Proposed Significant New Use Rule 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for the chemical substance described generically as polyalkylene polyamine which is the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P-89-963 and which is subject to a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA. This proposal
would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process this substance for a significant new
use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing, importing, or processing activities for a
use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide EPA with the opportunity to
evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it can occur.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of P-89-963 for the significant new uses designated herein. The required notice would provide
EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities. 


I. Authority 

Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances.

Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information
submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3),
and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under
section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received a SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action,
section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the 

Federal Register

 its reasons for not taking action.

Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification
provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. 


II. Applicability of General Provisions



General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. On July 27, 1988 (53 FR
28354), and July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31298), EPA promulgated amendments to the general provisions which apply to this SNUR.
In the 

Federal Register

 of August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31252), EPA promulgated a ``User Fee Rule'' (40 CFR part 700) under the authority of TSCA section
26(b). Provisions requiring persons submitting significant new use notices to submit certain fees to EPA are discussed
in detail in that 

Federal Register

 document. Interested persons should refer to these documents for further information. 


III. Background



EPA published a direct final SNUR for the chemical substance, which was the subject of PMN P-89-963 and
a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA, in the 

Federal Register

 of June 8, 1993 (58 FR 32227). EPA received a notice of intent to submit adverse comments for this chemical substance
following publication. Therefore, as required by  721.160, the final SNUR for P-89-963 is being
withdrawn elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 and this proposed rule on the substance is being issued.

EPA is not soliciting and will not respond to comments on any of the other SNURs that were published in the June 8, 1993,


Federal Register

 because those rules became effective August 7, 1993, or are being withdrawn and proposed in separate actions. The
supporting rationale and background to this proposal are more fully set out in the preamble to the direct final SNUR
for this substance and in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures
for the proposal and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data.



IV. Substance Subject to This Rule



EPA is proposing significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substance under
part 721 subpart E. 



PMN Number P-89-963 




Chemical name:

 (generic) Polyalkylene polyamine. 


CAS Number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of section 5(e) consent order:

 June 27, 1992. 


Basis for section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i), (ii)(I), and (ii)(II) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance
may present an unreasonable risk of injury to the environment, and that this substance is expected to be produced in
substantial quantities and there may be significant or substantial human exposures. 


Toxicity concern:

 The PMN substance and similar chemicals have been shown to cause acute toxicity to aquatic organisms at low levels
of exposure. Specifically, based on data submitted on the PMN substance, the fish acute LC50 value is 780 ppm, the daphnid
acute LC50 value is 10 ppm, and the algal acute EC50 value is 2.9 ppm. Applying an assessment factor of 100 to the daphnid
acute value, EPA predicts that chronic toxicity to aquatic life may occur at concentrations as low as 100 ppb. 


Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that the results of a 28-day repeated dose oral study in rats (OECD Guideline No. 407) would
help characterize possible human health effects posed by the substance. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed
the production volume limit without performing this test. 


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.6193. 


V. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 


EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Because this SNUR was first published on June
8, 1993, as a direct final rule, that date will serve as the date after which uses will be considered to be new uses. If
uses which had commenced between that date and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather
than new, any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would
make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing of the substance for uses regulated through this SNUR after June 8, 1993, will have to cease any
such activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply
with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires. EPA, not wishing to disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing
for a proposed significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR unnecessarily, has promulgated provisions
to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions
of advance compliance as codified at  721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements
of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the
substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they
must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have
to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires. 


VI. Economic Analysis 


EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers,
importers, and processors of the chemical substance at the time of the direct final rule. The analysis is unchanged
for the substance in this proposed rule. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the public record
for this proposed rule (OPPTS-50608B). 


VII. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information


Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other
appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public
file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party
submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file. 


VIII. Rulemaking Record



EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS-50608). The record includes
basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with
additional information as it is received.

EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any time between this proposal and designation
of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation. A public version
of the record without any CBI is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located in Rm. NE-B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington,
DC 20460. 



IX. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 



A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant''
and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected
by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substance.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the rule would not be substantial, even if
all of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act



OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this rule under the provisions of the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0012.

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public
comments on the information requirements contained in this proposal.

Alkenyl Ether of Alkanetriol Polymer; Proposed Significant New Use Rule 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for the chemical substance described generically as an alkenyl ether of alkanetriol polymer, which is the subject
of premanufacture notice (PMN) P-93-458. This proposal would require certain persons who intend to manufacture,
import, or process this substance for a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing,
importing, or processing activities for a use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice
would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity
before it can occur. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of P-93-458 for the significant new uses designated herein. The required notice would provide
EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities. 


I. Authority 


Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances.

Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information
submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3),
and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a Significant New Use Notice (SNUN), EPA may take
regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received a SNUN. If EPA
does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the 

Federal Register

 its reasons for not taking action.

Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification
provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. 


II. Applicability of General Provisions



General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. On July 27, 1988 (53 FR
28354), and July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31298), EPA promulgated amendments to the general provisions which apply to this SNUR.
In the 

Federal Register

 of August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31252), EPA promulgated a ``User Fee Rule'' (40 CFR part 700) under the authority of TSCA section
26(b). Provisions requiring persons submitting SNUNs to submit certain fees to EPA are discussed in detail in that


Federal Register

 document. Interested persons should refer to these documents for further information. 

III. Background



EPA published a direct final SNUR for the chemical substance, which was the subject of PMN P-93-458 in the


Federal Register

 of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51672). EPA received adverse comments following publication for this chemical substance.
Therefore, as required by  721.160, the final SNUR for P-93-458 is being withdrawn elsewhere in
this issue of the 

Federal Register

 and this proposed rule on the substance is being issued. EPA is not soliciting and will not respond to comments on any
of the other SNURs that were published in the October 4, 1993, 

Federal Register

 because those rules became effective on December 3, 1993, or are being withdrawn and proposed in a separate action.
The supporting rationale and background to this proposal are more fully set out in the preamble to the direct final
SNUR for this substance and in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures
for the proposal and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data.

The SNUR for P-93-458 stated that EPA was concerned for potential environmental effects of the substance
at concentrations as low as 1 ppb (part per billion) (the concern level) based on the submitted test data and by analogy
to nonionic surfactants. The SNUR also stated that use of the substance as a thickening agent for textile printing
does not present an unreasonable risk due to the fact that the material would not be released to surface waters at concentrations
greater than 1 ppb. As a result, EPA proposed that the significant new use for this material is any use which may result
in release of the substance to surface waters at concentrations greater than 1 ppb. 
The commenter was the submitter of P-93-458. The commenter stated that the substance is not comparable
to nonionic surfactants because the class of nonionic detergents have different proportions of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic groups and that the determination to regulate this substance should be based on the data provided within
the PMN. EPA used the toxicity data supplied in the PMN to evaluate the acute effects of the substance. However, EPA
also used data from chronic toxicity tests on similar chemicals to evaluate potential chronic toxicity of the substance.
The substance is classified as a nonionic surfactant by EPA because it has the chemical structural characteristics
of nonionic surfactants. The class of nonionic surfactants which EPA has the most data for are the alcohol ethoxylates.
EPA realized that this approach may overestimate the toxicity of the substance, but when evaluating potential chronic
toxicity in the absence of chronic toxicity data on the specific substance, EPA will use the best relevant data set,
even if this may predict higher toxicity, and err on the side of safety rather than underestimate toxicity. Classifying
the substance as a nonionic surfactant does not assume that the PMN substance will be a strong detergent. 
The commenter stated that on the basis of the acute toxicity studies provided in the PMN, where no mortality or immobilization
were found in the fish and daphnids, a high assessment factor should not be used and the maximum environmental concentration
of 1 ppb is too conservative. EPA agrees that no effects were observed during fish and daphnid acute toxicity tests.
However, the hardness of the dilution water in the acute tests was 250.0 and 246.0 mg/L as CaCO

3

, for fish and daphnids, respectively. Hard water is known to decrease the effectiveness of detergents and surfactants.
EPA recommends a hardness of less than 180 mg/L for freshwater fish, and daphnid acute and chronic toxicity tests.
It is possible that if the hardness of the dilution water had been less than 180 mg/L, toxic effects would have been observed.
In addition, effects were observed for green algae. EPA has evaluated toxicity data for chemicals which produce no
effects at saturation during short-term exposures, but do have toxic effects at longer exposures during the fish
early life stage toxicity test and the daphnid reproduction test. EPA has reviewed the submitted acute toxicity and
its analogue data. Based on predicted chronic toxicity values of 1 ppm for fish and daphnids, a measured chronic toxicity
value of 1 ppm for algae and an assessment factor of 10, the revised concern concentration is 100 ppb. 


The commenter stated that EPA had not established that release to surface waters above 1 ppb was indeed a new use. The
commenter noted that a Notice of Commencement (NOC) had been filed for the substance on June 16, 1993. The commenter
and its customers have been using the substance since that time without the determination required under 40 CFR 721.90(a)(4),
(b)(4), and (c)(4). The commenter also stated that release of the substance to surface waters at a concentration greater
than 1 ppb did not constitute a change in the type and extent of exposures, production volume, or the manufacturing
process specified in the PMN as required under section 5(a)(2) of TSCA. The commenter asserted that the data submitted
in the PMN does not indicate that the uses other than that submitted in the PMN may be a significant risk to the environment.

EPA disagrees with these assertions. Based on information in the PMN supplied by the commenter, EPA estimated reasonable
worst case water releases during processing and use. None of these estimated water releases were expected to exceed
1 ppb under even reasonable worst case assumptions. The basis for the assumptions made by EPA, including the information
in the PMN and EPA's exposure estimates can be found in the public docket for this substance (OPPTS-50612). If
any interested parties have data demonstrating releases to surface waters above 1 ppb (or the new concern level of
100 ppb), they should furnish that data with their comments. The mere fact that an NOC has been received or that the determination
required under 40 CFR 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) has not been made by the submitter or its customers is not evidence
that releases exceeding the concern level have occurred. 
EPA identified several other uses for the substance including use as a paper binder, a flocculation aid for paper manufacturing,
and a surfactant intermediate. In addition, the commenter noted on the PMN that they intended to import the substance.
The commenter or any other manufacturer could elect to manufacture the substance in the United States. Any manufacturer,
importer, or processor could use or distribute the substance in commerce for the other uses cited in this paragraph.
If domestic manufacture or the other uses of the substance occur, it is possible that a change in the projected volume
of manufacturing and processing, the type, form, magnitude, and duration of exposure, or the reasonably anticipated
manner and methods of manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, and disposal could also occur, resulting
in surface water concentrations above the concern level of 100 ppb. 


IV. Substance Subject to This Rule



EPA is proposing significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substance under
40 CFR part 721. 


PMN Number P-93-458 




Chemical name:

 (generic) Alkenyl ether of alkanetriol polymer. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Basis for action:

 The PMN substance will be used as a thickening agent for textile printing. Based on analogy to nonionic surfactants
and on the submitted acute aquatic toxicity data, EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at
a concentration as low as 100 ppb of the PMN substance in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as
described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters
at concentrations above 100 ppb. EPA has determined that other uses of the substance may result in releases to surface
water at concentrations above 100 ppb. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria under
 721.170(b)(4)(iii). 


Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined a chronic 60-day fish early life stage toxicity test in rainbow trout (40 CFR 797.1600) and
a 21-day chronic daphnid toxicity test (40 CFR 797.1330), where the dilution water hardness is less than 180
mg/L, would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance. 


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.3367. 


V. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 


EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Because this SNUR was first published on October
4, 1993, as a direct final rule, that date will serve as the date after which uses will be considered to be new uses. If
uses which had commenced between that date and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather
than new, any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would
make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing of the substance for uses regulated through this SNUR after October 4, 1993, will have to cease
any such activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply
with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires. EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing for a proposed significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions
to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions
of advance compliance as codified at  721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements
of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the
substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they
must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have
to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires.



VI. Economic Analysis 


EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing SNUN requirements for potential manufacturers, importers,
and processors of the chemical substance at the time of the direct final rule. The analysis is unchanged for the substance
in this proposed rule. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the public record for this proposed
rule (OPPTS-50612D). 


VII. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information



Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other
appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public
file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party
submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file. 


VIII. Rulemaking Record



EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS-50612D). The record includes
basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with
additional information as it is received.

EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any time between this proposal and designation
of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation. A public version
of the record without any CBI is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located in Rm. NE-B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington,
DC 20460. 


IX. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant''
and is therefore not subject to OMB review.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected
by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUNs for the substance.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the rule would not be substantial, even if
all of the SNUN submitters were small firms. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act



OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0012.

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St.,
SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public
comments on the information requirements contained in this proposed rule.

Manufacturing Incentives for Alternative Fuel Vehicles

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Under the corporate average fuel economy program, certain incentives are provided for the manufacture of alternative
fuel vehicles, including dual fuel vehicles. Among other things, dual fuel passenger automobiles which meet a minimum
driving range qualify for special treatment in the calculation of fuel economy. In order to implement a new statutory
requirement, NHTSA is proposing to amend its existing regulation concerning minimum driving range. The minimum
driving range for all dual fuel passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles would be set at 200 miles. The agency
is also proposing to establish gallons equivalent measurements for certain gaseous fuels. These measurements are
needed to calculate the fuel economy of alternative fueled vehicles. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


A. Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 


Section 6 of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 amended the fuel economy provisions of the Motor Vehicle Information
and Cost Savings Act (Cost Savings Act) by adding a new section 513, ``Manufacturing Incentives for Automobiles.''
Section 513 contained incentives for the manufacture of vehicles designed to operate on alcohol or natural gas, including
dual fuel vehicles, i.e., vehicles capable of operating on one of those alternative fuels and either gasoline or diesel
fuel. 
Section 513 provided that dual fuel vehicles meeting specified criteria qualify for special treatment in the calculation
of their fuel economy for purposes of the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The fuel economy of a qualifying
vehicle is calculated in a manner that results in a relatively high fuel economy value, thus encouraging its production
as a way of facilitating a manufacturer's compliance with the CAFE standards. One of the qualifying criteria for passenger
automobiles was to meet a minimum driving range, which was to be established by NHTSA. 
NHTSA was required to establish two minimum driving ranges, one for ``dual energy'' (alcohol/gasoline or diesel
fuel) passenger automobiles when operating on alcohol, and the other for ``natural gas dual energy'' (natural gas/gasoline
or diesel fuel) passenger automobiles when operating on natural gas. In establishing the driving ranges, NHTSA was
required to consider the purposes of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act, consumer acceptability, economic practicability,
technology, environmental impact, safety, driveability, performance, and any other factors deemed relevant.

The Alternative Motor Fuels Act and its legislative history made it clear that the driving ranges were to be low enough
to encourage the production of dual fuel passenger automobiles, yet not so low that motorists would be discouraged
by a low driving range from actually fueling their vehicles with the alternative fuels. Section 513(h)(2)(C) provided
that the minimum driving range for ``dual energy'' passenger automobiles may not be less than 200 miles. Section 513(h)(2)(B)
allowed passenger automobile manufacturers to petition the agency to set a lower range for a particular model or models
than the range established by the agency for all models. However, the minimum driving range could not be reduced to
less than 200 miles for any model of ``dual energy'' passenger automobile. 


B. Establishment of Part 538 


On April 26, 1990, NHTSA published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 17611) a final rule establishing 49 CFR part 538, 

Driving Ranges for Dual Energy and Natural Gas Dual Energy Passenger Automobiles.

 The agency established a minimum driving range of 200 miles for ``dual energy'' passenger automobiles, and a minimum
driving range of 100 miles for ``natural gas dual energy'' passenger automobiles. NHTSA did not specify higher ranges
because it was concerned that such ranges could discourage manufacturers from producing dual fueled vehicles, since
the manufacturers would need to redesign their vehicles to accommodate additional or larger fuel tanks in order to
meet the higher ranges. 
In part 538, NHTSA also established procedures by which manufacturers may petition the agency to establish a lower
driving range for a specific model or models of ``natural gas dual energy'' passenger automobiles and by which the
agency may grant or deny such petitions. 


C. Energy Policy Act of 1992

<TEXT>
 

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended section 513 of the Cost Savings Act to expand the scope of the alternative fuels
it promotes. The amended section provided incentives for the production of vehicles using, in addition to alcohol
and natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, hydrogen, coal derived liquid fuels, fuels (other than alcohol) derived
from biological materials, electricity (including electricity from solar energy), and any fuel NHTSA determines,
by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental
benefits. 


Section 513 continued to provide incentives for the production of dual fuel vehicles, i.e., vehicles that operate
on one of a now expanded list of alternative fuels and on gasoline or diesel fuel. NHTSA notes that some statutory terminology
was changed by the 1992 amendments. Among other things, the terms ``dual energy'' and ``natural gas dual energy''
were dropped, and the terms ``alternative fueled automobile,'' ``dedicated automobile,'' and ``dual fueled automobile''
were added. 


Section 513 also continued to require dual fueled passenger automobiles to meet specified criteria, including meeting
a minimum driving range, in order to qualify for the special treatment in the calculation of their fuel economy for
purposes of the CAFE standards. 


One change made by the 1992 amendments concerning driving ranges was that, under section 513(h)(2), the minimum driving
range set by NHTSA may not be less than 200 miles for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles.
The amendments also provided that the agency may not, in response to petitions from manufacturers, set an alternative
range for a particular model or models that is lower than 200 miles, except for electric vehicles. 


The 1992 amendments necessitate amending part 538. First, the existing 100 mile minimum driving range for vehicles
previously categorized as ``natural gas dual energy'' vehicles must be raised to at least 200 miles. Also, NHTSA must
establish a minimum driving range for the expanded scope of dual fueled vehicles. Part 538's petition procedures
also need to be amended to conform to the new statutory provisions. 


In addition to necessitating amendments to part 538's driving range provisions, the 1992 amendments also require
NHTSA to ``determine the appropriate gallons equivalent measurement for gaseous fuels other than natural gas * * *.''
Such a measurement is needed to carry out the special fuel economy calculations that apply to alternative fuel vehicles.




Proposal 




In this document, NHTSA is proposing to amend part 538 to make it consistent with the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings
Act. As discussed below, the agency is proposing to set the minimum driving range for all dual fueled passenger automobiles
other than electric vehicles at 200 miles. NHTSA is also proposing to remove the petition procedures until it sets
a minimum driving range for electric dual fueled passenger automobiles. 

The agency notes that, due to the complexity of the issues relating to establishment of a minimum driving range for
electric dual fueled passenger automobiles, otherwise known as hybrid electric vehicles, it is addressing that
issue in a separate rulemaking. On September 22, 1994, NHTSA published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 48589) a request for comments seeking information that would help it develop a proposal in that area. 


The agency is also proposing in this document to add 
to Part 538, gallons equivalent measurements for compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum
gas, hydrogen, and hythane. 
NHTSA notes that, on July 5, 1994, the Cost Savings Act was revised and codified ``without substantive change.'' The
provisions formerly found in section 513 of the Cost Savings Act are now at 49 U.S.C. 32901, 32905, and 32906. 




A. Minimum Driving Range for Dual Fueled Passenger Automobiles Other Than Electric Vehicles



In light of the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act, NHTSA is proposing to set the minimum driving range for dual
fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles. 

As before, the agency is required to consider the following factors in prescribing a minimum driving range: The purposes
of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, consumer acceptability, economic practicability, technology, environmental
impact, safety, driveability, performance, and any other factors considered relevant. Moreover, given the purposes
of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act and its legislative history, NHTSA continues to believe that the minimum driving
ranges should be low enough to encourage the production of dual fueled passenger automobiles, yet not so low that motorists
would be discouraged by a low driving range from actually fueling their vehicles with the alternative fuels. 


As discussed above, NHTSA addressed the appropriate level for minimum driving range in April 1990. The agency believes
that the only relevant changed conditions since that time are: (1) the decision by Congress to require the minimum
driving range for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles to be at least 200 miles, and (2)
the expanded scope of dual fueled passenger automobiles for which a minimum driving range must be established. 


Part 538 currently specifies a minimum driving range of 200 miles for alcohol dual fueled passenger automobiles.
The agency does not believe that any relevant events have occurred since that range was established that should lead
to a different range. NHTSA notes that alcohol dual fueled vehicles are designed so that the same fuel tank is used for
either alcohol or gasoline. The available space in a passenger automobile for fuel tanks is limited. In setting a driving
range of 200 miles for these vehicles, the agency was concerned that a higher minimum range could require some automobiles
to be redesigned to accommodate larger fuel tanks, thereby discouraging the production of such vehicles.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941219-1-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941219-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

NHTSA believes that the same considerations that apply to alcohol dual fueled vehicles also apply to ones fueled by
other liquids. The agency is unaware of any other potentially available liquid alternative fuels that would have
a significantly higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis. Assuming that other liquid alternative fuels
do not have a significantly higher energy content, a driving range greater than 200 miles for dual fueled passenger
automobiles using any liquid fuel could necessitate redesign of the vehicles to accommodate a larger fuel tank. The
agency requests comments on whether there are any potentially available liquid alternative fuels that do have a significantly
higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis, and, if so, whether a driving range higher than 200 miles should
be set for such fuels. Depending on the comments, the agency may set a higher driving range for such vehicles. 


The above discussion assumes that the same fuel tank could be used for both the alternative liquid fuel and gasoline,
as is the case for alcohol dual fueled vehicles. If a separate fuel tank were required for the alternative liquid fuel,
the limited available space in a passenger automobile for such an additional tank would be an even more critical reason
not to set the minimum driving range above 200 miles. 


Gaseous fuels always require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel. In the previous rulemaking concerning
minimum driving range, the agency's concerns about the limited available space in a passenger automobile for additional
fuel tanks led it to establish a 100 mile minimum driving range for natural gas dual fueled vehicles. 


Given the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act, NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the minimum driving range
for these vehicles should be increased to 200 miles. As discussed above, the agency cannot set a lower minimum driving
range for these vehicles. Moreover, NHTSA believes that the minimum range should not be greater than 200 miles because
such a range could discourage manufacturers from producing natural gas dual fueled vehicles, given the limited available
space for additional fuel tanks. The agency notes that the concerns it expressed in 1990 about a driving range greater
than 100 miles for these vehicles would be of even greater significance for ranges above 200 miles. 


The same considerations that apply to natural gas dual fueled vehicles also apply to dual fueled vehicles using other
gaseous fuels, since all of these vehicles require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel. Therefore, the
agency is proposing to establish a 200 mile driving range for these vehicles as well. 



B. Proposed Gallon Equivalents for Gaseous Fuels 




In order to carry out the special procedures for fuel economy calculations that apply to alternative fuel vehicles,
it is necessary, for gaseous fuel vehicles, to have a gallons equivalent measurement. The 1992 amendments to the Cost
Savings Act specified that 100 cubic feet of natural gas is deemed to contain 0.823 gallon equivalent of gasoline.
The 1992 amendments required NHTSA to determine the appropriate gallons equivalent measurement for gaseous fuels
other than natural gas, and a gallon equivalent of such gaseous fuel shall be considered to have a fuel content of 15
one-hundredths of a gallon of fuel. 


As part of determining appropriate gallons equivalent measurements for gaseous fuels, NHTSA consulted with the
Department of Energy (DOE) Fuels Utilization Data and Analysis Division. NHTSA and DOE agreed that the following
gaseous fuels could be potential transportation fuels by 2008: liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG), and hydrogen. 


Pursuant to a contract with DOE, Abacus Technology Corporation prepared a report titled ``Energy Equivalent Values
of Three Alternative Fuels: Liquefied Natural Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, and Hydrogen.'' This report is available
for review at the docket number cited in the heading of this notice. The Abacus report develops gallons equivalent
measurements for LNG, LPG, and hydrogen gaseous fuels. 



After reviewing the Abacus report, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Mobile Sources recommended
adding hythane fuel (a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas (principally methane)) as a gaseous fuel for which a gallon
equivalent should be calculated. EPA stated that although hythane is currently being used and evaluated on a limited
basis, there is a possibility that hythane fuel may become commercially available as a gaseous fuel. In a follow-up
report, which is also available in the docket, Abacus developed an appropriate gallon equivalent measurement for
hythane. 


NHTSA notes that Abacus recommended using lower heating values for deriving the gallons equivalent measurements
for gaseous fuels because this value represents the energy available from combustion in an engine. 




1. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)



The first Abacus report noted that the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 included natural gas as an alternative fuel,
but did not specify its physical state as a compressed gas or a liquefied gas. The report assumed that the Act was referring
to compressed natural gas, which was the more familiar technology when the Act was passed. The Abacus report recommended
that the same 0.823 gallon equivalent of natural gas established in the Alternative Motor Fuels Act be applied to LNG
based on energy content in British Thermal Unit (BTU)/Standard Cubic Feet (SCF), because LNG composition and heat
of combustion are similar to compressed natural gas. 




2. Liquefied Propane Gas (LPG) 



The Gas Processors Association Standard 2140-92 specifies four grades of LPG. They are commercial propane,
commercial butane, commercial butane-propane mixtures, and propane HD-5. Propane HD-5 is recognized
as the most suitable fuel for internal combustion engines operating at moderate to high engine severity. The Abacus
report concluded that one gallon of LPG, grade HD-5, is equivalent to 0.732 gallon of gasoline, using a lower
heating value.

3. Hydrogen



The Abacus report concluded that the gallon equivalent of 100 SCF of hydrogen is 0.240, using a lower heating value.




4. Hythane



Hythane is a combination of two gaseous fuels: hydrogen and natural gas. Most of the experimental engine work involves
the mixtures of 85 volume percent natural gas and 15 volume percent hydrogen (Hy5). The maximum concentration of hydrogen
that can be used without potentially causing engine problems, such as backfiring, is 15 percent (5 percent energy
content). The second Abacus report concluded that the gallon equivalent of 100 SCF of this hythane mixture is 0.725
using the lower heating value. 
NHTSA is proposing to adopt the gallons equivalent measurements for LNG, LPG, hydrogen, and hythane recommended
by the Abacus reports. The agency requests comments on the methodology used to determine the proposed gallons equivalent
measurements. NHTSA also requests comments on whether any other gaseous fuel may potentially be used in automobiles
in the foreseeable future, and thus, whether gallons equivalents for any other gaseous fuels should be established.

NHTSA plans to add the gallons equivalent measurements to Part 538. The agency is proposing a new name for this part
to reflect its expanded scope. 


Regulatory Impacts 



A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking
action and has determined that the action is not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory
policies and procedures. In this NPRM, the agency proposes to set the minimum driving range for all dual fueled passenger
automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles and to establish gallon equivalents for specified gaseous
fuels. None of the proposed changes will result in an additional burden on manufacturers. They would not impose any
mandatory requirements but would instead implement statutory incentives to encourage the manufacture of alternative
fuel vehicles. For these reasons, NHTSA believes that any impacts on manufacturers will be so minimal as not to warrant
preparation of a full regulatory evaluation. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify
that this proposed rule, if made final, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The rationale for this certification is that, to the extent that any passenger automobile manufacturers
qualify as small entities, their number would not be substantial. Moreover, conversion of vehicles to dual fuel status
with the minimum ranges that would be established by this regulation would be voluntarily undertaken in order to achieve
beneficial CAFE treatment of those vehicles. Therefore, no significant costs would be imposed on any manufacturers
or other small entities. 


C. National Environmental Policy Act


The agency has also analyzed this rule for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act, and determined that
it would not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Increased evaporative emissions
due to added fuel volume would be the most important environmental impact of this rulemaking if it induced manufacturers
to enlarge the size of existing fuel tanks in order to produce dual fuel vehicles operating on alcohol or other liquid
fuel. However, the proposed minimum range would not make it necessary for these dual fuel vehicles to have enlarged
fuel tanks. Natural gas and other gaseous dual fueled automobiles will not expect to increase evaporative emissions
since gaseous tanks do not normally vent to the atmosphere. 


D. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The procedures in this proposed rule for passenger automobile manufacturers to petition for lower driving ranges
are considered to be information collection requirements as that term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) in 5 CFR part 1320. The information collection requirements for part 538 have been submitted to and approved
by the OMB, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.) This collection of information has been assigned OMB Control No. 2127-0554. (Minimum Driving Ranges for
Dual Energy Passenger Automobiles) and has been approved for use through June 30, 1996. 



E. Federalism



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. 



F. Civil Justice Reform 



This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect and it does not preempt any State law. 49 U.S.C. 32909 sets
forth a procedure for judicial review of automobile fuel economy regulations. That section does not require submission
of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

I. Background


A. General Information


Natural gas is a vapor that is lighter than air at standard temperature and pressure.
 When used as a motor fuel, natural gas is typically stored on-board a vehicle in cylindrical containers at a pressure
of approximately 20,684 kPa pressure (3,000 psi). Natural gas is kept in this compressed state to increase the amount
that can be stored on-board the vehicle. This in turn serves to increase the vehicle's driving range. Since natural
gas is a flammable fuel and is stored under high pressure, natural gas containers pose a potential risk to motor vehicle
safety.






Vehicles powered by CNG have not been numerous to date, although they are increasing. The number of CNG vehicles in
the United States has more than doubled from 10,300 in 1990 to 23,800 at the end of 1992. The number of CNG vehicles is
projected to again double to an estimated 50,800 vehicles in 1994. As discussed in detail in a final rule published
on April 22, 1994, establishing Standard No. 303, 

Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles

, recent Federal legislation, as well as the need to meet environmental and energy security goals, will lead to increased
production and use of these vehicles. (59 FR 19648)



B. Previous Agency Rulemakings



On October 12, 1990, NHTSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to explore whether the agency
should issue Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs) applicable to CNG fuel containers and the fuel systems
of motor vehicles using CNG or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a motor fuel. (55 FR 41561). The ANPRM sought comment
about the crash integrity of vehicle fuel systems, the integrity of fuel storage containers, and pressure relief
for such containers.

On January 21, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed to establish
a new FMVSS specifying performance requirements for vehicles fueled by CNG. (58 FR 5323). The proposal was based on
comments received in response to the ANPRM and other available information.The NPRM was divided into two segments:
(1) vehicle requirements that focused on the integrity of the entire fuel system, and (2) equipment requirements
that focused on the fuel containers alone. In that notice, the agency proposed specific requirements applicable
to the initial strength, durability, and pressure relief characteristics of CNG containers. In addition, the agency
sought comments about the effects of corrosion and cold temperature extremes on CNG containers, and their rupture
without fragmentation.

NHTSA received a large number of comments to the docket addressing the January 1993 proposal. The commenters included
manufacturers of CNG containers, vehicle manufacturers, trade associations, other CNG-oriented businesses,
research organizations, State and local governments, the United States Department of Energy, and energy companies.
In addition, NHTSA met with the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) and the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) and
had telephone conversations meetings with some of the commenters. A record of each of these contacts may be reviewed
in the public docket.

The commenters generally believed that a Federal safety standard regulating the integrity of CNG fuel systems and
fuel containers is necessary and appropriate. In fact, some commenters, including the CGA, the NGVC, and CNG container
manufacturers stated that NHTSA should issue a Federal standard as soon as possible to facilitate the safe and expeditious
introduction of CNG fueled vehicles. With respect to the equipment requirements, the commenters generally believe
that Federal requirements about the CNG fuel container integrity are needed and should be implemented as quickly
as possible.

In addition to comments addressing the proposed requirements for durability, strength, and pressure relief, some
commenters favored the promulgation of requirements about corrosion resistance, high and low temperature extremes,
damage tolerance, and rupture characteristics of CNG containers.

As noted above, NHTSA recently established Standard No. 303. It specifies vehicle performance requirements for
the fuel system of vehicles fueled by CNG. The Standard enhances the fuel system integrity of CNG vehicles by subjecting
the vehicles to crash testing and placing a limit on the post-crash pressure drop in the fuel system. The Standard specifies
frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests for light vehicles and a moving contoured barrier crash test for school
buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds.

NHTSA has also issued a final rule that establishes a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 304,


Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Containers,

 that specifies tests and performance requirements applicable to a CNG fuel container's durability, strength, and
pressure relief. A pressure cycling test evaluates a container's durability by requiring a container to withstand
without any leakage, 18,000 cycles of pressurization and depressurization. This requirement helps to ensure that
a CNG container is capable of sustaining the cycling loads imposed on the container during refuelings over its service
life. A burst test evaluates a container's initial strength and resistance to degradation over time. This requirement
helps to ensure that a container's design and material are appropriately strong over the container's life. A bonfire
test evaluates a container's pressure relief characteristics when pressure builds in a container, primarily due
to temperature rise. In addition, the final rule specifies labeling requirements for CNG fuel containers. These
requirements are based on specifications in NGV2, a voluntary industry standard addressing CNG fuel containers
which was adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
.





NGV2 specifies four types of container designs. A Type 1 container is a metallic noncomposite container. A Type 2 container
is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a hoop wrapped pattern over
the liner's cylinder wall. A Type 3 container is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass
is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire liner, including the domes. A Type 4 container is a non-metallic
liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire
liner, including the domes.



II. Agency Supplemental Proposal



A. General



Based on comments to the January 1993 NPRM and other available information, NHTSA has decided to issue this supplemental
notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM), to propose additional performance requirements and tests to ensure a CNG
container's structural integrity. Among the proposed tests are environmental cycling tests, a low temperature
impact test, a gunfire test, a flaw tolerance test, a pendulum impact test, and a drop test. One environmental cycling
test would evaluate a container's resistance to internal corrosion and high humidity as well as the effects of high
and low temperatures on a container. A second environmental test would evaluate a container's resistance to road
salt and other acidic chemicals. The impact test, known as the Charpy test, would evaluate a metal container's brittle
fracture characteristics under low temperatures. The gunfire test would evaluate container fragmentation. Three
tests, the flaw tolerance test, the pendulum impact test, and the drop test, would evaluate a container's resistance
to external damage. Specifically, the flaw tolerance test would evaluate a container's exterior resistance to abrasion;
the pendulum impact test would evaluate a container's ability to withstand a sharp external blow; and the drop test
would evaluate a container's ability to withstand a blunt external blow. This notice also proposes labeling requirements
applicable to CNG vehicles and labeling requirements for CNG containers in addition to those required by the CNG container
final rule.

<TEXT>
 

Each of the proposed performance requirements and test procedures are modeled after provisions in NGV2 or are similar
to those requirements. The agency tentatively concludes that modeling the Federal standard after NGV2 would be the
best way to regulate how a CNG container reacts to such conditions as corrosive substances, temperature extremes,
external damage, and rupture. In some instances, the agency departed from NGV2's performance requirements and test
criteria to be consistent with 49 U.S.C. 30111 (formerly section 103 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act, 15 U.S.C.  1392). That statute commands the agency to issue ``motor vehicle safety standards'' that are
practicable, meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and are stated in objective terms. One example of such a departure
can be found in the environmental cycling performance requirement for internal corrosion. Instead of stating that
there shall be no ``evidence of distortion, deterioration, or failure,'' the proposal states that the container
``shall not leak or be distorted.'' Another example can be found in the gunfire test conditions. Instead of stating
that ``(t)he distance from firing location to test container is not to exceed 46 meters,'' the proposal states that
``(t)he distance from firing location to test container is 46 meters.'' The most significant differences between
the proposal and NGV2 are discussed below.



B. Environmental Cycling Test



Section 1-18(d)(2) of NGV2 includes an environmental cycling test to prevent the unreasonable corrosion of
a CNG container's internal surface. In addition, this test evaluates the effect that high humidity as well as high
and low temperatures have on the CNG containers.






In the ANPRM and NPRM, NHTSA noted that the level of impurities in CNG (i.e., gas quality) could influence the fuel container's
integrity. Specifically, certain compounds in CNG could lead to stress corrosion cracking, corrosion, fatigue
or other internal harm to the container's integrity. Such harm could cause the CNG containers to fail. The agency initially
decided not to propose a performance test to address a CNG container's ability to withstand corrosion, since the agency
was not aware of any readily available performance test that would address the failure modes at issue. Nevertheless,
in the NPRM, NHTSA requested comments about the need for a requirement addressing corrosion and, if so, what tests
and performance levels are most appropriate. In particular, the agency requested comment about the practicability
of using the NGV2's environmental cycling test. In the NPRM, the agency specifically asked whether, instead of adopting
the first sentence of the test verbatim, the agency should say ``One representative container free of any protective
coating shall be cycle tested as follows, and shall not leak * * *''

Commenters on the NPRM stated that there are two principal ways to regulate containers to prevent unreasonable internal
corrosion: (1) Regulating the gas quality or (2) regulating container performance. NGVC, Pressed Steel Tank Co.,
EDO, the National Fire Protection Association, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), Tecogen,
and Ontario recommended that the agency adopt gas quality requirements for CNG such as those set forth in a Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE's) Recommended Practice SAE J1616, ``Fuel Composition for Natural Gas Vehicles,''
February 1994. That recommended practice addresses internal corrosion by limiting the amount of water and other
impurities in CNG.

After reviewing the comments and other available information. NHTSA has decided to propose a corrosion resistance
requirement for CNG containers. The agency notes that under 49 U.S.C. 30101 

et seq.

 (formerly the Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

), NHTSA is authorized to regulate the manufacture of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment. However, it has
no authority to regulate fuel quality since fuel is not considered to be motor vehicle equipment. Therefore, NHTSA
cannot issue standards regulating the quality of CNG. Nevertheless, the agency encourages the industry to improve
gas quality for CNG vehicles through voluntary standards such as SA J1616.

NHTSA has decided to propose a performance requirement to ensure that a CNG container resists corrosion. Such a requirement
would prevent catastrophic failures of CNG containers due to internal corrosion. This is particularly important
since the agency only has statutory authority to issue safety standards that regulate the condition and performance
of vehicles prior to their first consumer purchase. The agency does not have any authority to require periodic inspection
of containers for corrosion. NHTSA is proposing to adopt an environmental cycling performance requirement and test
procedure patterned after the ones in NGV2. The proposed performance requirement is set forth in S7.5, and the proposed
test conditions and procedures, in S8.5.

NGV2 states that a ``container free of any protective coating shall be cycle tested, without showing evidence of distortion,
deterioration or failure * * *'' The agency believes that while the term ``without distortion'' appears
to be objective, the terms ``without deterioration or failure'' are too ambiguous and broad to permit their incorporation
in a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. Therefore, the agency has decided not to include the terms ``deterioration''
and ``failure'' in its proposal. Instead, the agency is proposing that its pass/fail criteria for the environmental
cycling test depart from NGV2 and state that, when cycle tested, the CNG container ``shall not leak or permanently
change in external configuration or dimensions.'' NHTSA has added the prohibition against leakage, since the absence
of leakage can be objectively determined. Further, the prohibition is consistent with the environmental cycling
test's safety goal and with the pressure cycling test and hydrostatic burst test that the agency adopted when it issued
Standard No. 304.

Under today's proposal, the phrase ``shall not . . . permanently change in external configuration
or dimensions'' throughout the test is intended to serve the same purpose as the NGV2 ``no distortion'' criterion.
Thus, if there were a slight bulge in one location or if there were a change in the container's volume by even one tenth
of one percent, the container would be considered to be distorted. A pass/fail gauge could be adjusted to fit the container
before the test, and then used again after the test to verify that a container's dimensions had not changed. NHTSA requests
comments about this ``zero distortion'' requirement, and whether some amount of distortion should be allowed. If
so, how should the permissible amount of distortion be quantified and measured? The agency also invites comments
on how the no distortion criterion might otherwise be objectively expressed. In addition, the agency requests comments
on whether there are other terms, such as fiber delamination, which should be incorporated and how they could be objectively
defined.
As an alternative, NHTSA is considering a no leakage criterion as the sole pass/failure performance requirement.
However, under this alternative, the agency would increase the two sets of 5,000 cycles to 9,000 cycles each. Thus,
the standard would specify a total of 18,000 cycles instead of the 10,000 cycles currently specified in NGV2. The agency
tentatively concludes that the additional cycles would be necessary since this alternative proposal would otherwise
be less stringent than NGV2 which contains additional criteria to disqualify substandard containers, i.e., distortion,
deterioration, and failure. The agency further notes that 18,000 cycles is consistent with the ambient pressure
cycling in NGV2 and in FMVSS No. 304. That cycling represents severe service, i.e., four refuelings per day, 300 days
per year for 15 years. The agency requests comments on this alternative, and on other approaches that might be more
appropriate. In addition, the agency requests that commenters suggesting other approaches include measurable
pass/fail performance criteria and a proposed test procedure.
Section S8.5 sets forth the procedures and conditions for the environmental cycling test. As with the proposed performance
requirements, these provisions are modeled after NGV2. The agency has tentatively adopted modified versions of
certain provisions in order to be consistent with the criteria that are within the agency's authority.
NGV2 further specifies that during the environmental cycling test the container is pressurized ``using natural
gas or methane.'' This is part of the test's preconditioning phase in which a corrosive material is introduced inside
the container to determine its corrosion resistance. The agency is proposing that only automotive grade natural
gas be used in the environmental cycling test. The agency believes that specifying only one test gas would make the
test more repeatable for enforcement purposes. Further, although the major constituent of natural gas is methane,
natural gas does contain other minor constituents which could make the test performed with natural gas more severe
than if only pure methane were used. Therefore, the use of natural gas would represent a more severe scenario that is
closer to real world use. NHTSA requests comment on the appropriateness of using only natural gas in the environmental
cycling test, rather than specifying both fuels.
NHTSA has decided to propose language addressing the use of protective coatings that it believes is consistent with
NGV2. Specifically, S8.5.2 states that ``A CNG fuel container 

free of any protective coating

'' is cycle tested in a specified manner. The agency believes that the phrase ``free of any protective coating'' refers
to temporary coatings such as oil and grease, so as not to inhibit action from the corrosive materials during subsequent
testing. The agency further believes that it would be inappropriate for the agency to preclude permanent coatings
such as paint or other materials, since this would discourage manufacturers from applying permanent coatings that
increase corrosion resistance. The agency requests comments on how best to describe this concept. An alternative
to the proposal to specify ``free of any protective coating,'' would be to specify ``The container shall be in the as
manufactured condition.''

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA is also proposing relative humidity conditions during the environmental cycling test. Specifically, under
the proposal, S8.5.2.2 would specify ``Condition the container for 48 hours at zero pressure, 60
  C (140
  F) and 95 percent relative humidity. To obtain the specified temperature and relative humidity, spray with
a fine spray or mist of water at 60
  C (140
  F) in a chamber held at 60
  C (140
  F).'' NHTSA requests comments on how the phrase ``fine spray or mist of water'' could be made more objective,
since different rates of spray might influence the humidity level. As an alternative, the agency is considering a
rate of spray consistent with ANSI standard Z26.1-1977, which is referenced in FMVSS NO. 205, 

Glazing Materials

. That provision specifies that ``The fine spray of water shall be under a pressure of 172 to 207 kPa (25 to 30 psi) at the
nozzle and in sufficient volume to wet the container immediately upon impact.'' Another alternative would be to specify
a relative humidity level of 95 percent. This would allow manufacturers and test facilities the flexibility to determine
how that level is achieved. The agency requests comments on how best to specify relative humidity in the environmental
cycling test.

In comments to the NPRM, Norris and NGV Systems supported an alternative corrosion test issued by the National Association
of Corrosion Engineers (NACE), NACE Standard TM0177-90. The NACE voluntary standard includes several test
methods for determining the sulfide stress cracking resistance of steels. Sulfide stress cracking corrosion can
result from the presence of too much hydrogen sulfide in natural gas. NHTSA requests comments on the appropriateness
of using the NACE test either in conjunction with or in lieu of NGV2's environmental cycling test.

The NACE test provides a laboratory method but does not specify acceptable results. If the agency were to incorporate
the NACE test in an FMVSS, it would be necessary to specify performance requirements. The agency believes that this
could be done by making the performance requirements consistent with the ones already contained in the draft International
Standards Organization (ISO) standard for CNG containers (Section A13). If the agency decides to adopt the NACE test,
the NACE Standard Tensile Test method would be used and subsized tensile specimens (gauge diameter 2.54 mm) would
be machined from the wall of a finished container, placed under constant tensile load, and immersed in the NACE test
solution. Tests would be conducted to demonstrate that the threshold stress exceeds 20 percent of the specified minimum
yield strength of the steel, where threshold stress is the maximum stress at or below which no specimen fails the test
for a period of 720 hours. NHTSA requests comments on the need for the NACE test and various aspects of the test, including
the appropriateness of setting threshold stress at 20 percent above the yield strength and the number of tests which
should be conducted to demonstrate this.



C. Road Salt Environmental Test



NHTSA has decided to propose a road salt environmental test for CNG fuel containers to address the potential for container
degradation due to road salt and other acidic chemicals. The proposed test is in addition to the environmental cycling
test already discussed.

NHTSA has decided to propose this requirement after learning of two CNG fiberglass fuel container failures which
occurred in early 1994. NHTSA is concerned about the exposure of container exterior surfaces to acidic fluids, which
may lead to stress corrosion cracking and container failure. Depending on the environmental conditions present,
road salt or salt spray while driving in wet conditions, can be acidic in nature. Therefore, the agency proposes this
road salt environmental test to address these potential safety problems.

The number of test cycles and the pass/fail criterion are the same as those proposed for the environmental cycling
test discussed earlier. However, prior to cycling, the fuel container would be exposed to salt spray in accordance
with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) B117-73, ``Method of Salt Spray (Fog) Testing.'' This
method of salt spray testing is used in FMVSS NO. 108, 

Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment

 for testing the corrosion resistance of headlamps.

Under the proposal, a CNG fuel container would be exposed to the salt spray for 240 hours, consisting of ten successive
24 hours periods. Within each period, the container would be exposed to the spray for 23 hours. During the 24th hour,
the salt spray would not be activated. Following the 240 hours of salt spray exposure, the container would then be cycled
for 5,000 cycles, through hydrostatic pressurization, from not more than 10 percent of service pressure to service
pressure. Then it would be hydrostatically pressure cycled for another 5,000 cycles from not more than 10 percent
of the service pressure to 125 percent of the service pressure. When tested in this way, the container would be prohibited
from leaking or permanently changing in external configuration or dimensions.

NHTSA requests comments on the appropriateness of using this test to address exterior environmental degradation
of CNG fuel containers due to road salt and other acidic chemicals. The agency specifically requests comments on whether
the proposed test would adequately address the potential for stress corrosion cracking of fiberglass overwrap in
CNG fuel containers, and whether it should be applied to all types of CNG fuel containers, including all metal, hoop
wrapped with metal liner, full wrapped with metal liner, and all composite for both fiberglass and carbon fiber. NHTSA
also requests comments on whether the 240 hours of salt spray exposure appropriately reflects the amount of exposure
which can reasonable be expected during the life of a CNG fuel container.

In addition, NHTSA requests comments on the pH level of the salt solution used in the proposed test method. Under ASTM
B-117, the pH level of the salt solution is in the range of 6.5 to 7.2 at 35
 C, although the method provides for an upward or downward adjustment in pH. A downward adjustment of pH level
would make the solution more acidic, thereby representing more severe road chemicals which CNG containers may encounter.
It appears possible that stress corrosion cracking of fiberglass may be accelerated with decreasing pH. Therefore,
the agency requests comments on whether a lower pH range for the salt solution should be specified in the test method,
such as three to four.

NHTSA also requests comments on whether to specify the pass/fail criterion for the salt spray test to ``no leakage''
in lieu of ``shall not leak or be permanently changed in external configuration or dimensions.'' Concurrently, the
agency would also increase the number of cycles during testing from two sets of 5,000 cycles each to two sets of 9,000
cycles each. The agency requests comments on whether these modifications in the number of cycles would be appropriate
for the road salt test as well as the environmental cycling test discussed earlier. The agency also requests comments
on the estimated cost of the salt spray test and the extent to which current CNG containers would comply with the requirements.



D. Charpy Impact Test



Section 1-12(d) and 1-13(e) of NGV2 set forth an impact test, known as the Charpy test, and performance
criteria to address brittle fracture of steel CNG containers and liners under low temperatures. NGV2 states that
this test is an indicator of the performance of heat treated steels.
 The Charpy test evaluates marginal heat treating performance which can lead to poor fracture performance, degraded
resistance to stress corrosion cracking, and lessened fatigue resistance.





In the NPRM, NHTSA requested comments on whether there is a safety problem sufficiently serious to warrant establishing
a requirement for low temperature testing of CNG container materials. The agency requested these comments due to
its concern that certain materials such as high strength steels can lose their ductility at low temperatures, a situation
that could lead to a container's catastrophic failure. The agency requested specific comments on the Charpy impact
test set forth in NGV2.

NGV Systems, ARC, Comdyne, Pressed Steel Tank, EDO, Fiber Dynamics, AAMA, Minnesota Gas, Amoco, Navistar, CNG Pittsburgh,
and Manchester commented about the need for cold temperature testing. All but Manchester believed that the standard
should include some sort of cold temperature testing for containers. Manchester stated that the container's service
environment should be examined to determine if such cold temperature testing is needed. Most commenters stated that
temperature extremes should be accounted for in the standard but did not elaborate about the specific test. PST recommended
that the agency include the Charpy impact test in the Federal standard. AAMA and EDO recommended that the containers
be cycled at ^40
  C (^40
  F) and ^50
  C (^58
  F), respectively.

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 304 to include a low temperature
test patterned after the Charpy impact test. This test is set forth in sections 1-12(d) and 1-13(e) of NGV2,
which references 

Methods for Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic Materials

, ASTM E 23. Section 1-13(e) states that the average energy absorbed by the three test specimens shall not be less
than 100 J/cm2. The minimum value for any one specimen shall not be less than 80 J/cm2. Under the test, a pendulum swings
down and hits a specimen. The test device then measures the amount of energy transmitted into the specimen needed to
break it. If the specimen breaks at low levels of energy, then it would fail the test. To illustrate, while a substance
such as glass would break at very low energy levels, a non-brittle metal would break only at relatively high energy
levels. Specifically, the purpose of this test is to determine the brittle fracture behavior of steels. It also evaluates
the performance of steels which have been heat treated as part of the manufacturing process. An improper heat treatment
process can result in the material being brittle and thus more susceptible to fatigue and stress corrosion cracking.
Non-steel containers and liners need not be tested to comply with the Charpy test because they are not heat treated
this way. The agency requests comments about the agency's decision to propose the Charpy impact test. Is it appropriate
to only apply these requirements to Type 1 containers and Type 2 and Type 3 containers with steel liners? In addition,
NHTSA requests comments on applicable performance tests for fracture and fatigue assessment of liner materials
other than steel, if such materials perform a structural function, e.g., aluminum liners or containers. Along with
this information, commenters should include a description of the specific performance tests recommended, along
with objective pass/fail criteria.

NHTSA agrees with the recommendations by AAMA and EDO that containers be pressure cycled at low temperatures (e.g.,
^40
  C (^40
  F)). The agency notes that this low temperature is consistent with test conditions in NGV2 and NHTSA standards,
including Standard No. 105, 

Hydraulic Brake Systems,

 Standard No. 106, 

Brake Hoses, 

and Standard No. 108, 

Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment.

 The agency requests comment about whether the proposed test temperature is appropriate.

In response to Manchester's comment that the service environment should be examined to determine if cold temperature
testing is needed for a particular container, NHTSA notes that it would be impracticable to determine what type of
environment each individual container would encounter. In establishing a requirement, the agency believes that
it is appropriate to test CNG containers in a worst case scenario, such as the low temperature levels being proposed.



E. Gunfire Test



Section 1-18(j) of NGV2 includes a gunfire test that evaluates whether a fully pressurized container fragments
upon suffering a high impact puncture. A similar puncture could occur in a motor vehicle crash, causing the propulsion
of container fragments at high speeds. The gunfire test assures that a container will instead essentially remain
in one piece.

In the NPRM, the agency discussed a specific test criterion in which the container would be permitted to rupture only
if there were no fragmentation. The container industry refers to this situation as ``leak before burst.'' Containers
that leak before bursting are designed to release their contents through the sidewall without explosive fragmentation
when the container becomes overpressurized. The industry tests for this characteristic by piercing the pressurized
container with a gunshot. The area around the container is then examined for fragmentation. The container is supposed
to be designed so that no fragments will break off during this failure. In the NPRM, the agency requested comments about
how to define the term ``without fragmenting'' for regulatory and compliance purposes.

Brunswick, NGV Systems, PST, EDO, CNG Pittsburg, and AAMA commented about container fragmentation. These commenters
stated that in the event of a rupture, the CNG fuel containers should be designed to release their contents through
their sidewalls without fragmentation. Brunswick, AAMA, NGV Systems, EDO, and PST commented about how to define
the phrase ``without fragmenting.'' EDO recommended that the container be required to remain ``in one piece.'' NGV
Systems stated it should be defined as ``no separation of parts such that projectiles are possible.'' AAMA stated
that it should be defined as ``no separation of pieces exceeding one gram in mass from the fuel tank.'' Brunswick stated
that it should be defined as loss of small pieces not exceeding 30 grams (one ounce) in weight. PST also indicated that
30 grams (one ounce) is an acceptable size.

Based on the comments and other available information, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 304 to include
a gunfire test similar to the one set forth in NGV2, with some modifications. The agency believes that if a CNG container
is punctured in a crash, the failure should result in a controllable situation, e.g., fuel leakage, rather than a catastrophic
explosion of the container. A catastrophic failure would present a much more serious failure mode than fuel leakage
through the sidewall, since fragments could be propelled in all directions at high speeds and with tremendous force.
Such fragments could pose a significant safety risk to vehicle occupants and others near the vehicle.

With respect to the performance criteria for the gunfire test, NGV2 states that ``The tested container shall reveal
no evidence of a fragmentation failure'' and ``Loss of small pieces of composite material which would not have sufficient
momentum to penetrate sheet metal typically found in automobile construction shall not constitute failure of the
test.'' Under the second phrase, NGV2 allows the fragmentation of small pieces, even though the gunfire test is intended
to prevent fragmentation.

NHTSA has tentatively concluded that some of NGV2's performance requirements and test conditions are insufficiently
objective for use in a FMVSS. In order to establish objective, safety criteria, NHTSA has decided to propose incorporating
the recommendations by Brunswick and PST to prohibit fragments exceeding 30 grams (one ounce) in mass. Although the
intent of the gunfire test is to demonstrate no fragmentation, the agency understands that small composite pieces
or fragments are considered normal. Therefore, the agency has tentatively concluded that to prohibit all fragmentation,
as recommended by EDO and NGV Systems would not be practicable. Similarly, the agency believes that AAMA's recommendation
to prohibit the separation of pieces exceeding one gram (0.035 ounce) would not be practicable and would involve very
small pieces that could be difficult to measure. NHTSA has tentatively concluded that prohibiting pieces in excess
of 30 grams would provide for a practicable, objective, and safe performance criterion for the gunfire test. However,
the agency requests comments on the proposed size, and whether the standard should prohibit all fragmentation or
whether some smaller level of fragmentation would be measurable and safe. What is the lightest container fragment
that would be readily measurable and would not pose an unreasonable risk to the safety of motorists? NHTSA also seeks
comment on whether the container should be pressurized with nitrogen or air, since only one gas should be used to assure
consistency of testing.

NHTSA has tentatively determined that it is necessary to depart from certain aspects of the gunfire test in NGV2 to
make the agency's proposed requirement objective and ensure repeatable test results. As proposed in this notice,
these modifications include specifying the precise muzzle velocity, the projectile's path, and the precise distance.




F. Damage Tolerance Tests



1. General Considerations



NGV2 addresses damage tolerance with three separate tests: a flaw tolerance test, a pendulum impact test, and a drop
test. In general, the damage tolerance tests serve to evaluate damage caused by incidental contact with other objects.
Such contact can occur in a variety of ways. For instance, containers mounted underneath the vehicle could be damaged
by road debris. Similarly, containers mounted in the bed of a pickup truck could be damaged by cargo or tools being thrown
on them. The flaw tolerance test evaluates abrasive damage to composite overwraps such as scratches and small cuts
on the container. If the overwraps are cut or gouged, they may unravel or delaminate, possibly causing container failure.
The pendulum impact evaluates sharp blows to the container. The drop test evaluates blunt impacts to the container.

NHTSA did not address damage tolerance in the January 1993 NPRM. Nevertheless, CGA, Tecogen, Comdyne, ARC, and Brunswick
commented that a container's resistance to mechanical damage from incidental contact or road debris should be tested.
Of these commenters, only Brunswick suggested a specific test procedure to determine container damage tolerance.
Brunswick stated that NGV2 adequately addresses resistance to mechanical damage with the flaw tolerance, pendulum
impact, and drop tests. In addition, it stated that the effects of more severe damage, such as a puncture, are addressed
with the gunfire test.


NHTSA has decided to propose the three damage tolerance tests in NGV2 because the agency has tentatively concluded
that, during normal use, CNG containers may be exposed to each type of external damage addressed by these tests. This
may be especially true for containers sold in the aftermarket, since vehicle manufacturers would presumably be more
likely than vehicle converters to design their vehicles to protect containers from exposure to road debris and other
damage. This is so because vehicle manufacturers can design a CNG vehicle with container placement in mind. Converters
are not involved in the original designing of the vehicles they convert and may have to place a container in a relatively
vulnerable location given space limitations.

NHTSA is proposing to subject Type 1 containers to the drop test, but not to the other two tests, since noncomposite
metal containers are generally not affected by the proposed damage evaluated by those tests. Type 2, 3, and 4 composite
containers would be subject to all three damage tolerance tests. The agency requests comments about the appropriateness
of applying the proposed damage tolerance tests to the different types of CNG containers.

In NGV2, the criterion for each damage tolerance test is that the container, after having a cut made into the container
or being impacted, must sustain 1,500 pressure cycles without evidence of failure such as distortion or leakage.
The only exception to this is the drop test. The drop test in NGV2 requires two alternative sets of cycling tests. If
the container sustains damage that would cause its rejection at a three year inspection interval specified by NGV2,
the container is tested for 1,500 cycles. In contrast, if the container sustains damage that would cause it not to be
rejected at a three year inspection, it is tested for 18,000 cycles. The 1,500 cycles in NGV2 apparently corresponds
to the maximum number of fills expected during the three year inspection interval. Because NGV2 requires reinspection
every three years, it is structured to permit a level of damage to the container that would keep it in service until the
maximum inspection interval of three years is completed. In contrast, NHTSA has no statutory authority to require
container inspection after the first consumer purchase of the container.

In today's notice, NHTSA is proposing 1,500 cycles for the flaw tolerance and pendulum impact tests, and the more severe
alternative of 18,000 cycles for the drop test. This is consistent with the manner of cycles specified in NGV2, after
which the agency is patterning its proposal. However, since NHTSA has no authority to require the periodic inspection
of CNG containers, the agency requests comments on whether 1,500 cycles is adequate to assure the safety of a CNG container
throughout its life. As a alternative, the agency is considering requiring 18,000 cycles for the flaw tolerance and
pendulum impact tests. This is consistent with the pressure cycling test in FMVSS No. 304 and with the drop test where
no inspection would be involved. It would also represent the worst case scenario for a container which sustains damage
early in its service life, but may not be subsequently inspected, since 18,000 cycles represents four refuelings
per day, 300 days per year for 15 years. The agency requests comments on the appropriate number of cycles for the flaw
tolerance, pendulum impact, and drop tests to assure the safety of the traveling public.


2. Flaw Tolerance Test


Section 1-18(f)(1) of NGV2 sets forth a flaw tolerance test, which evaluates a container's ability to withstand
external damage caused by abrasive material scratching a container, NHTSA is proposing to adopt the flaw tolerance
test in NGV2 with some minor modifications. The agency's adaptation of these performance requirements and test conditions
and procedures is set forth in sections S7.8 and S8.8 of this notice's regulatory text.

NGV2's flaw tolerance test specifies that the container shall be tested ``without evidence of distortion, deterioration
or failure'' and ``show no evidence of flaw propagation
 or other physical damage likely to weaken the container appreciably.'' as explained in the earlier discussion on
the environmental cycling test, these performance requirements contain subjective criteria that the agency believes
need to be modified to be objective and enforceable. The agency believes that the terms ``without deterioration or
failure'' and ``other physical damage likely to weaken the container appreciably'' are unreasonably ambiguous
and broad. Therefore, the agency has decided not to include, in the proposed requirement, the terms ``deterioration''
and ``failure'' and the phrase ``other physical damage likely to weaken the container appreciably'' since these
terms are not sufficiently objective to include in a Federal standard and would not provide measurable criteria for
enforcement. The agency welcomes comments about ways to refine terms to make them objective. In addition, the agency
requests comments on whether there are other terms, such as fiber delamination, which should be incorporated and
how they could objectively be defined.





Instead, the agency is proposing a modified version of the NGV2 pass/fail criteria for the flaw tolerance test that
states that when cycle tested, the CNG container ``shall not leak or permanently change in external configuration
or dimension.'' In addition, NHTSA is proposing an additional performance provision to prohibit the growth of a longitudinal
cut made in the container. NHTSA has added the prohibitions against leakage and increase in the size of cut since compliance
with them can be objectively determined. It is also consistent with the flaw tolerance test's safety goal and with
the performance requirements for the presence cycling test and the hydrostatic burst test in Standard No. 304. The
agency previously discussed the no distortion criterion in the environmental cycling section and request similar
comments here. In addition, the other requirement being proposed for the flaw tolerance test is that the ``cut made
in accordance with S8.8 for the purpose of this test shall not increase in length, width or depth as a result of this test.''

NHTSA has tentatively determined that it is also necessary to depart from certain aspects of NGV2's flaw tolerance
test procedures and conditions to make agency's flaw tolerance test objective and repeatable. As proposed in this
notice, these modifications include specifying the precise dimensions and location of the flaw.
NGV2 specifies that a cut be made in the other wall at approximately midlength and that the cut be not less than 0.75 mm
(0.030 inches) in depth. The agency is proposing additional provisions to make the proposed FMVSS more precise, thereby
increasing the test procedure's objectivity and repeatability. For instance, the agency is proposing to amend the
standard to specify that the cut be 0.75 mm wide. The agency tentatively believes that these dimensions represent
abrasions that containers may experience as a result of contacting road debris. However, the agency requests comments
on the cut's dimensions, including the appropriate width, and whether the length, width, and number of such cuts should
be increased.

3. Pendulum Impact Test


Section 1-18(f)(2) of NGV2 sets forth a pendulum impact test which evaluates a container's ability to withstand
a sharp external blow. NHTSA is proposing to adopt the pendulum impact test in NGV2 with some minor modifications.
The agency's adoption of these performance requirements and test conditions is set forth in sections S7.9 and S8.9
of this notice's regulatory text.
NGV2 specifies that ``The tests shall be made on the points of the container which are regarded as vulnerable. The points
regarded as vulnerable are those which are most exposed or weakest having regard to the shape of the container and/or
the way in which it is installed on the vehicle.''
NHTSA has decided to propose modifying this provision since it is not objective. Instead, the agency is proposing
to require that the pendulum impact test be conducted at ``any point and any angle.'' NHTSA anticipates that to be able
to certify compliance with the requirement, manufacturers would direct the test impacts to the container's most
vulnerable points. Such a test procedure would be consistent with the regulatory language specified in Standard
No. 301's moving contoured barrier test. The agency requests comments about whether such a test condition would be
appropriate for pendulum impact testing of CNG containers.


4. Drop Test


Section 1-18(g) of NGV2 sets forth a drop test, which evaluates a container's ability to withstand a blunt external
blow. NHTSA is proposing to adopt the drop test in NGV2 with some minor modifications. The agency's adoption of these
performance requirements and test procedures is set forth in sections S7.10 and S8.10 of this notice's regulatory
text.
As with NGV2, NHTSA is proposing to specify that a container be dropped at ambient temperature without internal pressurization
or attached valves. In the test, the container is held in a horizontal position with the container's bottom 3.05 meters
(10 feet) above the surface onto which it is dropped.
Today's proposal, consistent with NGV2, specifies that the surface onto which the CNG container is dropped ``shall
be a smooth, horizontal concrete pad or flooring.'' NHTSA notes that this definition of the surface is not fully objective.
As an alternative, the agency is considering specifying that the surface be made of concrete that is at least four inches
thick. NHTSA requests comments on this alternative, and on how the surface could otherwise be more objectively defined.


G. Bonfire Test Fuel


In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the fire for the bonfire tests be generated by No. 2 diesel fuel. This fuel type was proposed
so that the standard would be consistent with the bonfire test in NGV2, which specifies this type of fuel.
NGVC, CGA, AAMA, and Norris commented that the agency should specify a different fuel to generate a bonfire that is
more environmentally sound. CGA stated that the large amounts of smoke that would be created by burning diesel fuel
are contrary to the environmental objectives of developing CNG vehicles. NGVC and Norris suggested using a CNG or
propane grill for the test.
In the final rule, NHTSA decided to specify the use of No. 2 diesel fuel. The agency explained that it was aware of the
environmental problems associated with this type of fuel and would further study whether other fuels should be used
to generate the bonfire test. However, the agency stated that until it could determine that a different fuel is an appropriate
(e.g., generates a fire of comparable heat and intensity) replacement for No. 2 diesel fuel, that fuel will be specified
for generating the bonfire.
NHTSA has decided to propose to amend the bonfire test conditions to allow alternative types of fuel, given the environmental
difficulties resulting from No. 2 diesel fuel. One alternative would be to allow manufacturers to conduct the test
with any fuel that generates a flame temperature equivalent to that of No. 2 diesel fuel. Under this alternative, any
fuel that generates a flame temperature of 850
  to 900
  C (the flame temperature of No. 2 diesel fuel) for the duration of the test, would be permitted. To verify the flame
temperature of 850
  to 900
  C for a period of 20 minutes, or until the container is fully vented or fails, three thermocouples would be located
on the container's bottom, 102 mm above the fuel surface, as measured before the fire is started. The thermocouples
would be placed so that one would be at the center of the container's bottom and one on each side of the container where
the dome and sidewall intersect. NHTSA requests comments about the appropriateness of this alternative, including
the use of flame temperature to define ``equivalence'' among fuel types. Would a different fuel characteristic such
as Btu/lb be more appropriate? If a commenter believes that an alternative approach would be more appropriate, it
should submit the test procedures associated with such an alternative.


H. Labeling Requirements


1. CNG Containers


a. Labeling information. 

In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to require that container manufacturers certify that each of their containers comply
with the proposed equipment requirements by permanently labeling the container with the following information:
The symbol ``DOT'' to constitute a certification by the manufacturer that the container conforms to all requirements
of the standard; the date of manufacture of the container; the name and address of the container manufacturer; and
the maximum service pressure. The agency stated that labeling the container would provide vehicle manufacturers
and consumers with assurance that they are purchasing containers that comply with the Federal safety standards.
In addition, the agency believed that the proposed requirement would facilitate the agency's enforcement efforts
by providing a ready means of identifying the container and its manufacturer.
EDO, NGVC, Thomas, NYCFD, and Volvo GM addressed the proposed labeling requirements. EDO and NYCFD stated that the
label should include the maximum fill pressure at a location close to the fill receptacle. NGVC recommended that a
blank area for the container installation date be included in the label to be filled in by the installer. Volvo GM stated
that only containers manufactured after the standard's effective date should be entitled to display the DOT symbol.
Thomas stated, without elaboration, that the labeling requirements of NGV2 should be adopted. NHTSA's proposal
did not include certain information specified in NGV2, including the type of container, inspector symbols, trademarks,
manufacturers's part number, and serial numbers.

<DOCNO> FR941219-1-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941219-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the CNG container final rule, NHTSA decided to adopt the proposed labeling requirements with a slight modification
from the proposed format. In item (a), the agency modified the proposal which states ``The tank manufacturer's name
and address'' to state the following: include the statement that ``If there is a question about the proper use, installation,
or maintenance of this container, contact [

manufacturer's name, address, and telephone number

].'' In the final rule, the agency decided not to require the other additional items of information in NGV2 since the
agency had not proposed requiring such information. Notwithstanding the agency's decision not to require this additional
information, the agency explained that a manufacturer may list such information on the label, provided that the additional
information does not obscure or confuse the required information. In particular, NHTSA urged manufacturers to include
the container type, e.g., Type 1, 2, 3 or 4, since the agency had adopted NGV2's design and material specifications
in the final rule. The agency believed that specifying the type of container would facilitate oversight of compliance
tests since each type of container is required to undergo a hydrostatic burst test with a safety factor unique to that
type.

In the final rule, NHTSA also explained that it anticipated proposing additional requirements about the CNG fuel
container's label. The agency is now proposing to amend S7.4 to specify that CNG containers be labeled with the following
additional information:

(1) The container designation (Type 1, 2, 3, or 4),

(2) The statement ``CNG ONLY,''

(3) The statement: ``This container should be visually inspected after a motor vehicle accident or fire and at least
every 36 months for damage and deterioration in accordance with the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) guidelines
C-6 and C-6.1 for Type 1 containers and C-6.2 for Types 2, 3, and 4 containers.''

(4) The statement: ``Do Not Use After 

XXXXXX

,'' inserting the year that is the 15th year beginning after the year in which the container is manufactured.

NHTSA believes that it would be in the interest of motor vehicle safety to add this information to the CNG container
label. Adding information about container type, e.g., Type 1, 2, 3 or 4 would be consistent with the agency's adoption
of NGV2's design and material specifications in the CNG final rule. The agency believes that specifying the type of
container would facilitate oversight of compliance tests since each type of container is required to undergo a hydrostatic
burst test with a safety factor unique to that type. Adding the phrase ``CNG ONLY'' would assure that CNG containers
are used only for CNG and are not used for other fuels for which the containers were not designed, such as liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG).

Since NHTSA has no statutory authority to require the periodic inspection of CNG containers after the first consumer
purchase, adding information about periodic inspections would help assure their safe use after this time. Such statements
would alert owners to the desirability for reinspection over time or in the event of an accident. The agency notes that
the proposed requirement is consistent with NGV2's guidelines for visual inspection of CNG containers every 36 months.
Reference to the CGA guidelines would provide standardized criteria by which to inspect containers built by different
manufacturers. The agency is proposing use of the visual inspection guidelines contained in CGA C-6, C-6.1,
and C-6.2, and not those for hydrostatic testing. In addition to the proposal that the container be inspected
after an accident or at least every 36 months, NHTSA requests comments about the need to specify both a time interval
and a mileage interval (e.g., the agency could require the following statement: ``This container should be visually
inspected after a motor vehicle accident or fire, and for damage or deterioration at least every 36 months or 36,000
miles, whichever comes first, in accordance with . . .''). What time and mileage intervals would be
most appropriate? Would an agency requirement for inspection every 12 months be appropriate?

NHTSA is proposing to require information about the container's service life in the belief that this information
would help assure that a CNG container is removed from service after its design service life expires. As commenters
on the NPRM stated, this is especially important since there is a finite period during which CNG containers can be used
safely. The agency is proposing 15 years because CNG containers built to follow NGV2 have a design service life of 15
years. Nevertheless, since containers may be built for a service life other than 15 years, the agency would allow a
manufacturer to specify the service life length appropriate to its containers.

The agency requests comments about the need for each of these proposed items of information and alternative ways to
specify this information.

b. 

Label location. 

In response to the NPRM, EDO and NYCFD stated that the label should include certain labeling information such as the
maximum fill pressure at a location close to the fill receptacle.

NHTSA has decided to propose requirements related to the label's location. Accordingly, the agency has decided to
propose that the containers be installed in a manner that ensures the visibility of the container labeling. Specifically,
the agency is proposing to require the label to be near the end of the container containing the outlet valve, since such
a location would help ensure that the label would be more visible during refueling. The agency notes that NGV2 contains
a similar requirement.



2. Vehicle labeling



The CNG vehicle final rule did not specify requirements for the labeling of CNG fueled vehicles. In this SNPRM, the
agency is proposing to amend Standard No. 303 to include two items of information.

S5.3.1 The statement: ``Maximum service pressure 

XXXX

 kPa (

XXXX

 psig).''

S5.3.2 The statement ``See instructions on fuel container for inspection and service life.''

The agency believes that the first item of information would help assure that CNG containers are not overfilled during
refueling. The second item is intended to assure that vehicle owners and operators are informed about the important
safety information on container inspection. In addition, the agency is proposing that for vehicles manufactured
or converted prior to the first sale to the consumer, the manufacturer provide this information in writing to the consumer,
either in the owner's manual or on a one page statement. The agency requests comments about the need for vehicle labeling
and written information bearing this and other information.

I. Other Safety Information



NHTSA requests comments on the following additional issues related to the safe performance of CNG containers. What
are the safety implications of fast-filling CNG containers during refueling, which can result in pressure levels
of 125 percent of service pressure due to the heat of pressurization? Do the initial permeation rates of CNG containers
constructed of nonmetallic liners remain constant over the life of the container? What are the consequences of gas
permeation from vehicles fueled by multiple CNG containers? What are the degradation characteristics of vinyl esters
and thermoplastic resins for composite material? Should containers and container liners have longitudinal or circumferential
welds?



J. Leadtime



NHTSA is proposing to make the requirements in this notice effective one year after publication of the final rule in
the 

Federal Register

. The agency believes this would be a reasonable time period for container manufacturers to test their containers
and certify compliance to the additional tests being proposed in this notice. The agency anticipates that container
manufacturers would readily be able to certify compliance to the proposed requirements. This is because container
manufacturers already certify compliance with NGV2, which is essentially consistent with the proposed requirements.
The one exception is the proposed salt spray test. 
The agency requests comments about the leadtime. Does one year provide sufficient time for manufacturers to certify
compliance to the proposed requirements? Would the addition of the proposed salt spray test require a longer leadtime
than one year?

In the meantime, prior to the standard's effective date, the industry is free to advertise containers as meeting the
CNG equipment standard that will take effect in one year. Manufacturers have sought to achieve early compliance with
other agency requirements
 such as those relating to dynamic side impact protection and air bags. The agency encourages manufacturers to seek,
to the extent feasible, to manufacture their CNG containers to meet these new requirements before the date the standard
takes effect. 





K. Benefits 



As explained earlier, NHTSA anticipates that the number of CNG fuel vehicles will increase greatly in the near future,
in light of directives by the Clinton Administration and legislation by Congress to develop vehicles powered by cleaner
burning fuels. This notice will enhance the safety of this growing population of vehicles, since CNG containers will
be required to comply with the tests in Standard No. 304. The necessity for certifying compliance with the Federal
requirements will provide added assurance that the containers are safe. The benefits of the proposal to issue additional
requirements applicable to CNG containers are to provide assurances of the structural integrity of the CNG containers.
The agency is adding one test not currently part of NGV2 (the salt spray test) to simulate environmental roadway conditions.
In addition, by helping to minimize any safety concerns associated with CNG vehicles, this rule should result in positive
environmental impacts.



 L. Costs



For six of the seven tests proposed, there would be no additional costs of upgrading current containers to comply with
the proposed requirements, since CNG container manufacturers already comply with NGV2. Similarly, there would
be no additional compliance test costs for these six tests, since the manufacturers already meet the NGV2 tests. Testing
and container costs for these six tests are estimated to range from $13,800 to $30,650 per container size and type.
The agency does not know whether existing containers can meet the proposed salt spray test, and what costs might be
incurred if the containers do not meet the proposed test. The agency estimates that the testing and container cost
for the salt spray test to range from $1,220 to $4,130. Total testing and container cost for the proposal are $15,020
to $34,780. The agency has made the criteria in some of the tests more objective than NGV2 by changing unacceptably
subjective and broad terms to more measurable and therefore more objective criteria.

Rulemaking Analyses and Notices



A. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulation) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning
and Review.'' This action has been determined to be ``nonsignificant'' under the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA has estimated the costs of the amendments in a Preliminary Regulatory
Evaluation (PRE) which has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. As discussed in that document, NHTSA estimates
that total testing and container costs for this proposal are $15,020 to $34,780 per container size and type. The agency
believes that a CNG container which meets the current industry standard, NGV2, would also comply with the requirements
of this proposal, with the exception of the salt spray test.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



NHTSA has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based upon
the agency's evaluation, I certify that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. For six of the seven tests, there will be no small business impacts since the proposed standards
are already being met. Comments are requested on current compliance with the salt spray test and whether this would
have small business impacts. Information available to the agency indicates that the businesses manufacturing CNG
fuel containers are not small businesses.



C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)



NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612. NHTSA has determined that the rule would not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment. No state has adopted requirements regulating CNG containers.



D. National Environmental Policy Act



In accordance with the national Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts
of this rule. The agency has determined that this rule would have no adverse impact on the quality of the human environment.
On the contrary, because NHTSA anticipates that ensuring the safety of CNG vehicles would encourage their use, NHTSA
believes that the rule would have positive environmental impacts since CNG vehicles are expected to have near-zero
evaporative emissions and the potential to produce very low exhaust emissions as well.



E. Civil Justice Reform



The proposal does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety
standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level
of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.



Public Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies
be submitted.

All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to thee submissions
without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary
arguments in a concise fashion.

If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel,
NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has
been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover
letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation.
49 CFR Part 512.

All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will
be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date.
To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late
for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. The
NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and
it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed,
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return
the postcard by mail.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Endangered 
Status for Four Plants From Vernal Pools and Mesic Areas in Northern 
California 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes endangered 
status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended 
(Act) for four plants: 

Lasthenia conjugens

 (Contra Costa 
goldfields), 

Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

pauciflora

 (few-flowered 
navarretia), 

Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

plieantha

 (many-flowered 
navarretia), and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

(Lake County stonecrop). 
These species grow in and around the margins of vernal pools and in 
seasonally wet areas in northern California. Habitat loss and 
degradation imperil the continued existence of these plants. This 
proposal, if made final, would implement the protection of the Act 
for these plants. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 





Lasthenia conjugens

 was described from specimen collected near 
Antioch in Contra Costa County, California (Greene 1888). Hall 
(1914) included the taxon within 

Baeria fremontii,

 however, Ferris 
(1958) later recognized this material as 

B. fremontii

 var. 

conjugens.

 
Ornduff (1966) submerged the genus 

Baeria

 under 

Lasthenia

 and 
recognized the specific rank of 

Lasthenia conjugens.

 



Lasthenia conjugens

 is a showy spring annual in the aster 
family (Asteraceae) that grows 10 to 30 centimeters (cm) (4 to 12 
inches (in)) tall and is usually branched. The leaves are opposite, 
light green, and usually have a feather-like arrangement with narrow 
clefts extending more than halfway toward the stem. The flowers are 
found in terminal yellow heads. The phyllaries are one-third to 
one-half fused; the achenes are less than 1.5 millimeters (mm) (0.06 
in) long and always lack a pappus. 

L. conjugens

 flowers from March 
to June. The partially fused phyllaries and the lack of a pappus 
distinguish this species from 

L. fremontii

 and 

L. burkei,

 which it 
otherwise closely resembles. 

Habitat for 

Lasthenia conjugens

 consists of vernal pools in 
open grassy areas in woodland and valley grassland communities at 
elevations of 1 to 445 meters (m) (3 to 1,460 feet (ft)). 
Historically found in such habitats in Alameda, Contra Costa, 
Mendocino, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Napa, and Solano Counties, 
California, this species is now apparently restricted to five 
localized populations in Napa and Solano Counties (California Native 
Plant Society (CNPS) 1978). One population is located on Travis Air 
Force Base, Solano County, California. All other populations are on 
private lands. 

The type specimen for 

Navarretia pauciflora

 was collected from 
a playa 8 kilometers (km) (5 miles (mi)) north of Lower Lake, Lake 
County, California (Mason 1946). Day (1993) revised the treatment of 


Navarretia

 and reduced 

N. pauciflora

 to a subspecies of 

N. 
leucocephala.

 More than a dozen species of 

Navarretia

 occur in the 
region, including several restricted to vernal pools. Five 
subspecies of 

Navarretia leucocephala

 are currently recognized (Day 
1993), two of which may hybridize with 

N. leucocephala

 ssp. 


pauciflora

 (Alva Day, California Academy of Sciences, pers. comm. 
1993). These two subspecies, 

N. leucocephala

 ssp. 

bakeri

 and 

N. 
leucocephala

 ssp. 

plieantha,

 differ from 

N. leucocephala

 ssp. 


pauciflora

 in stature, degree of hairiness, or size, number, or 
lobing of floral parts. The species that are being proposed for 
listing are not hybrids.

Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

pauciflora 

is a prostrate, spreading, and much-branched annual herb in the phlox family (Polemoniaceae). This plant grows 1
to 4 cm (0.4 to 1.6 in) in height. The nearly hairless leaves are linear and entire, or parted into a few linear lobes,
and 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1.0 in) long. The inflorescence is a head of 2 to 15 blue or white (fading to blue) flowers. A few spiny,
leaf-like bracts below each head extend out 1.5 to 3 times the radius of the head; bracts within the head are shorter.
The funnel-shaped corollas are 5 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long with five lobes 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long. Each corolla lobe has
a single unbranched vein. The stigma has two minute lobes. 

N. leucocephala

 ssp. 

pauciflora 

flowers May to June. 



Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

pauciflora 

is found growing in volcanic ash substrate, clay pan vernal pools in chaparral, grassland, or mixed coniferous forest
in southern Lake and Napa Counties. The subspecies has an elevation range of 450 to 850 m (1,400 to 2,800 ft) over a 50
square kilometer (sq km) (20 square mile (sq mi)) area. Historically, 

N. leucocephala

 ssp. 

pauciflora

 was known from nine sites in Napa and Lake Counties. The subspecies has become extirpated from six historic localities
(CNPS 1990a). The three extant populations occur on private lands. 




Navarretia

 

plieantha

 was described from the margin of Bogg's Lake in Lake County, California (Mason 1946). Day (1993) revised the treatment
of 

Navarretia

 and reduced the taxon to a subspecies of 

N. leucocephala. N. leucocephala

 ssp. 

plieantha

 is distinguished from 

Navarretia

 

leucocephala

 ssp. 

pauciflora 

by its more numerous flowering heads (20 to 50 flowers versus 2 to 15), and in having three or more pairs of outer bracts
with the bract lobes being forked or three-four branched from the base. It is distinguished from other congeners in
the region by stature, degree of hairiness, or size, number, or lobing of floral parts. 



Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

plieantha

 is a prostrate annual herb in the phlox family (Polemoniaceae) that forms a mat 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 in) wide. The leaves are
3 to 4 cm (1 to 1.6 in) long and linear or with a few widely spaced linear lobes. The inflorescence is a head composed of
20 to 50 white or blue flowers. Each head is 1.5 to 2 cm (0.6 to 0.8 in) across and is subtended by 3 to 4 leaf-like bracts
that are simple-pinnate or compound-pinnate and extend out 1 to 2 times the radius of the head. The bracts within the
head are shorter. The funnel-shaped corolla is 5 to 6 mm (0.2 to 0.24 in) long with five lobes each 2 mm (0.7 in) long. The
stigma is two-cleft or entire. 

N. leucocephala 

ssp. 

plieantha

 flowers in May and June. 



Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

plieantha

 is found in dry meadows, along the margins of volcanic ash substrate vernal pools and lakes, and in open, wet ground
in forest openings. It has an elevation range of 700 to 915 m (2,300 to 3,000 ft) over a 1,000 sq km (390 sq mi) area. 

N. leucocephala 

ssp. 

plieantha

 is historically known from seven locations in Lake and Sonoma Counties, California. One of the historic populations
in Sonoma County has not been seen in 32 years and is considered potentially extirpated (CNPS 1987). Four population
localities are found in Lake County. One population is protected on The Nature Conservancy preserve at Bogg's Lake.
The remaining three extant populations are on private lands. 



Parvisedum leiocarpum 

was described from 6.5 mi. north of Lower Lake, Lake County, California, as 

Sedella leiocarpa 

(Sharsmith 1940). Clausen (1946) subsequently reassigned the taxon to 

Parvisedum leiocarpum. 

Two similar species occur within the range of 

P. leiocarpum. P. pentandrum 

differs in having shorter petals, top-shaped flowers, and carpels with glandular bumps on the surfaces. 

Crassula connata 

differs in having only one to a few, four-petaled flowers above each leaf base, which are not arranged in definite cymes.




Parvisedum leiocarpum 

is a very low, erect to spreading, annual in the stonecrop family (Crassulaceae) with reddish stems 3 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in)
tall. The fleshy, succulent leaves are oblong, 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.19 in) long, and fall off the stem by flowering time.
The inflorescence is a cyme of campanulate yellow flowers that are crowded on the curving flowering stems in two rows.
The five petals are 3 to 3.5 mm (0.12 to 0.14 in) long with large, club-shaped red nectaries. The five carpels have smooth
surfaces. 

P. leiocarpum 

flowers in April and May. 



Parvisedum leiocarpum 

is found on volcanic substrate in areas of impeded drainage, such as in and along the margins of vernal pools and depressions
in bedrock. The historic range of the species encompasses six collection localities within a 16 km (10 mi) radius from
Siegler Springs near Lower Lake, Lake County, California (California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) 1991b).
Elevations of occurrence range from 365 to 790 m (1,300 to 2,600 ft). 

P. leiocarpum 

has apparently been destroyed at three sites within this area (CDFG 1991b, CNPS 1990b). The extant site populations
of 

P. leiocarpum 

cover a total area of less than 1.2 hectares (ha) (3 acres (ac)). All populations occur on private lands; none are protected.

Federal government actions on these four plants began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973,
as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be
endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51,
was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975, and included 

Lasthenia conjugens 

as threatened; and 

Navarretia pauciflora 

(now known as 

Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

pauciflora

), 

Navarretia plieantha

 (now known as 

Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

plieantha

), and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

as endangered. The Service published a notice in the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the report of the Smithsonian Institution as a petition within the context of section
4(c)(2) (petition provisions are now found in section 4(b)(3) of the Act) and its intention thereby to review the status
of the plant taxa named therein. The above four taxa were included in the July 1, 1975, notice. On June 16, 1976, the Service
published a proposal in the 

Federal Register

 (42 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species to be endangered species pursuant to section
4 of the Act. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian
Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication. 

Navarretia pauciflora 

and 

Navarretia plieantha 

were included in the June 16, 1976, 

Federal Register

 document. General comments received in relation to the 1976 proposal were summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 17909). 

The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978 required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace
period was given to those proposals already more than 2 years old. In the December 10, 1979, 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796), the Service published a notice of withdrawal of the June 6, 1976, proposal, along with four other proposals
that had expired. 

The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). This notice included


Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia pauciflora, Navarretia plieantha, 

and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

as category 1 candidates for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial
information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. On November 28,
1983, the Service published a supplement to the Notice of Review (48 FR 39526). This supplement changed 

Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia plieantha, Navarretia pauciflora, 

and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

from category 1 to category 2 candidates. Category 2 taxa are those for which data in the Service's possession indicate
listing is possibly appropriate, but for which substantial data on biological vulnerability and threats are not
currently known or on file to support proposed rules. 

The plant notice was revised on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526). 

Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia pauciflora, Navarretia plieantha,

 and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

were included as category 2 candidates. Another revision of the plant notice was published on February 21, 1990 (55
FR 6184). In this revision 

Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia plieantha, 

and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

were elevated to category 1 candidates. 

Navarretia pauciflora 

was retained as a category 2 candidate. Since the publication of that notice, the Service has received additional
information on the status of 

Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

pauciflora 

that supports the proposed listing of this species. The September 30, 1993, plant notice of review (58 FR 51144) included
all four plant taxa as category 1 candidates. 

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretary to make certain findings
on pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that
all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. This was the case
for 

Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia pauciflora, Navarretia plieantha, 

and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

because the 1975 Smithsonian report had been accepted as a petition. On October 13, 1982, the Service found that the
petitioned listing of these species was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance
with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485).
Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was
reviewed in October of 1983 through 1993. Publication of this proposal constitutes the final finding for the petitioned
action. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions
of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists of endangered and threatened species. A
species may be determined to be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section
4(a)(1). These factors and their application to 

Lasthenia conjugens 

Ornduff (Contra Costa goldfields), 

Navarretia leucocephala 

Benth. ssp. 

pauciflora 

(H. Mason) Day (few-flowered navarretia), 

Navarretia leucocephala

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Their Habitat or Range



The primary threats to 

Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

pauciflora, Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

plieantha, 

and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

consist of activities that result in the destruction of the plants or hydrologic changes in their vernal pool habitats.
Such activities include urbanization, industrial development, agricultural land conversion, off-highway vehicle
use, horseback riding, trampling by grazing cattle, and road widening. Damage or destruction of vernal pool habitat
happens quickly and easily due to the extremely friable nature of the soil and the dependency of the pool upon an intact
durapan or impermeable subsurface soil layer.




Lasthenia conjugens 

is no longer found in five of the seven counties in which it historically occurred. Agricultural land conversion,
urbanization, and associated developments have extirpated populations of this species in Alameda, Contra Costa,
Santa Clara, and Santa Barbara Counties (CNDDB 1993, CNPS 1978). Agricultural land conversion has extirpated one
additional population of 

L. conjugens 

in Napa County (CNDDB 1993). Widening and straightening of Ledgewood Creek north of Cordelia Road in Solano County
by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers eliminated a large amount of habitat and plants of 

L. conjugens 

(Ann Howald, CDFG, pers. comm., 1993). Urbanization threatens a population of 

L. conjugens 

in Napa County (CNDDB 1993; Jake Ruygut, CNPS, 

in. litt., 

1993). Off-highway vehicle traffic has adversely impacted this same population (CNDDB 1993). Industrial development
threatens a population of 

L. conjugens 

in Solano County (CNDDB 1993).




Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

pauciflora 

has disappeared at over 50 percent of the sites from which it historically occurred. Extant populations continue
to decline due to anthropogenic activities. Two population sites have been adversely affected by drainage or, in
one case, by the attempt to create a more permanent water source (CDFG 1989b). One partially drained site, Manning
Flat in Lake County, has experienced significant accelerated soil erosion, reducing the amount of available habitat
and the plant population (McCarten 1985; CDFG 1989b). Off-highway vehicle use has damaged several population sites
in Lake County (CDFG 1989b; CNDDB 1993). Agricultural land conversion to a rice field adversely affected another
population site in Lake County (CDFG 1989b). Pond construction for cattle watering partially destroyed the population
of 

N. leucocephala 

ssp. 

pauciflora

 at Ely Flat in Lake County and severely altered the hydrology of its habitat (CDFG 1989b). Agricultural land conversion
threatens this same population (CDFG 1989b; CNPS 1990a).




Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

plieantha 

has apparently been extirpated at one population site in Sonoma County. This area has been severely impacted by horseback
riding, feral pigs (

Sus scrofa

), and a tree eradication program (CNDDB 1993; John Herrick, CNPS, pers. comm., 1993). Off-highway vehicle use has
resulted in the destruction of plants and habitat of this subspecies at one location in Sonoma County, and at four population
sites in Lake County (CDFG 1991a). Urbanization threatens one population site in Lake County and the extant population
site in Sonoma County (CNDDB 1993). Attempted drainage of a pool in Lake County containing 

Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

plieantha 

has resulted in the invasion of two competitive weeds, 

Centaurea solstitialis 

and 

Taeniatherum caput-medusa 

(CNDDB 1993).




Parvisedum leiocarpum 

has been extirpated from 50 percent of its historic population sites. Attempted drainage has altered the hydrology
of two of the three remaining vernal pools containing populations of this plant (CNPS 1990b). Drainage attempts at
one of the sites resulted in severe erosion and a reduction of habitat and plant numbers (CNPS 1990b). Widening of Highway
29 by California Department of Transportation also threatens to impact this population (CNPS 1990b). Discing has
occurred at the third population site (CNDDB 1993). All population localities occur on privately owned, flat land
next to major roads. This makes them vulnerable to urban development and agricultural land conversion (CDFG 1989a,
CNPS 1990b). Off-highway vehicle use has occurred at two of the three 

P. leiocarpum 

population sites (CNDDB 1993, CNPS 1990b).


Population sites for each of the four species are impacted by trampling from grazing cattle and by feral pigs. Trampling
by livestock threatens all populations of 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

(CDFG 1989a).




B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



Due to the localized and limited distribution of 

Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

pauciflora, Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

plieantha, 

and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum, 

indiscriminate collecting of plants could seriously affect these species. Overutilization is not known to occur
at this time.



C. Disease or Predation 



Not known to be applicable.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



The State of California Fish and Game Commission has listed 

Parvisedum leiocarpum 

and 

Navarretia plieantha 

(now known as 

Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

plieantha

) as endangered species under the California Endangered Species Act (Chapter 1.5 Section 2050 

et seq. 

of the California Fish and Game Code and Title 14 California Code of Regulations 670.2 ). The California Fish and Game
Commission also has listed 

Navarretia pauciflora 

(now known as 

Navarretia leucocephala 

ssp. 

pauciflora

) as threatened. Listing by the State of California requires individuals to obtain a memorandum of understanding
with the CDFG to possess or ``take'' a listed species. Although the ``take'' of State-listed plants is prohibited
(California Native Plant Protection Act, Chapter 10 Section 1908 and California Endangered Species Act, Chapter
1.5 Section 2080), State law exempts the taking of such plants via habitat modification or land use changes by the owner.
After CDFG notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows on his or her property, State law requires that the
land owner notify the agency ``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to allow salvage of such a plant''
(Native Plant Protection Act, Chapter 10 Section 1913). 

The California Environmental Quality Act ((CEQA) Public Resources Code Sections 21000-21177) requires a
full disclosure of the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. The public agency with primary authority
or jurisdiction over the project is designated as the lead agency, and is responsible for conducting a review of the
project and consulting with the other agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. Section 15065
of the CEQA Guidelines, as amended, requires a finding of significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the
number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' Species that are eligible for listing as rare,
threatened, or endangered, but are not so listed, are given the same protection as those species that are officially
listed with the State or Federal governments. Once significant effects are identified, the lead agency has the option
to require mitigation for effects through changes in the project or to decide that overriding considerations make
mitigation infeasible (CEQA Section 21002). In the latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant
environmental damage, such as destruction of endangered species. Protection of listed species through CEQA is,
therefore, dependant upon the discretion of the agency involved. 

Because vernal pools are generally small and scattered, they are treated as isolated wetlands or waters of the United
States for regulatory purposes by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
The Clean Water Act regulates discharge of fill material into wetlands but does not itself protect the plants. Nationwide
Permit No. 26 (33 CFR part 330.5 (a)(26)) was established by the Corps to facilitate issuance of permits for discharge
of fill into wetlands up to 4 ha (10 ac). For project proposals falling under Nationwide Permit No. 26, the Corps has
been reluctant to withhold authorization unless a federally listed threatened or endangered species is known to
be present, regardless of the significance of other wetland resources. The section 404 regulations require an applicant
to obtain an individual permit to fill isolated wetlands or waters greater than 4 ha (10 ac). A project proponent affecting
wetland fill of less than one acre is only required to notify the Corps of their intent to fill wetlands. Compensatory
mitigation generally is not required for projects affecting less than one acre. In either case, candidate species
receive no special consideration. Additionally and equally important, upland watersheds are not provided any protection.
Disturbance to or loss of pool hydrological conditions has damaged populations and habitat as discussed previously
in Factor A. Reductions in water volume and inundation adversely affect all four plants. Thus, as a consequence of
the small scale of vernal pools and lack of protection of associated uplands, these vernal pools receive insufficient
protection.

E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Their Continued Existence



These four plant species are restricted in range and population numbers. 

Lasthenia conjugens

 is currently known from five population sites, 

Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

pauciflora

 from three sites, 

Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

plieantha

 from four sites, and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum

 from three sites. All four species occupy highly restricted and vulnerable habitats. The combination of low populations,
narrow range, and restriction and vulnerability of habitat make these plants susceptible to destruction of all or
a significant part of any population from random natural events such as flood, drought, disease, or other natural
occurrences. Low population numbers also make the populations vulnerable to genetic variations. Changes in gene
frequency, inbreeding, and genetic drift can result from populations becoming genetically depauperate. 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,
the preferred action is to list 

Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

pauciflora

, 

Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

plieantha

, and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum

 as endangered. Endangered status is appropriate for these four species due to the vulnerability of their restrictive
habitats, threats posed to those habitats by urbanization, agricultural land conversion, drainage, road widening,
off-highway vehicle use, stochastic events, and inadequate regulatory mechanisms. Critical habitat is not proposed
for these species for reasons discussed below. 



Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate
critical habitat concurrently with determining a species to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that
the designation of critical habitat is not prudent for these species at this time. Because the four species face numerous
anthropogenic threats (see Factors A, B, and E in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'') and occur predominantly
on private land, Federal actions affecting these species are limited. Designating critical habitat would not provide
any additional protection to the species. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in
the 

Federal Register

 may make the plants even more vulnerable to incidents of vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to the decline
of the four plant species. Thus, designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial and is accordingly, not prudent.
Responsible agencies will be notified of the importance of protecting the habitat of the species. Protection of the
species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and, under limited circumstances, through the section
7 consultation process. 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 

Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed
or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of
the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. 

Federal involvement may include Federal mortgage programs, including the Veterans Administration and the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (Federal Home Administration loans), the Federal Highway Administration
in the case of impacts from federally funded bridge and road construction, the Army Corps of Engineers through jurisdiction
of section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency through the Clean Water Act's provisions
for pesticide registration and waste management actions, and proposed activities on Travis Air Force Base.

Listing 

Lasthenia conjugens

, 

Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

pauciflora

, 

Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

plieantha

, and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum

 as endangered would provide for development of a recovery plan (or plans) for them. Such plan(s) would bring together
both State and Federal efforts for conservation of the plants. The recovery plan(s) would establish a framework for
agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in conservation efforts. The plan(s) would set recovery
priorities and estimate costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. It also would describe site-specific
management actions necessary to achieve conservation and survival of these four plants. Additionally, pursuant
to section 6 of the Act, the Service would be more likely to grant funds to affected states for management actions promoting
the protection and recovery of these species.

<TEXT>
 

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered plant species set forth
a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. With respect to the four plants
from the four counties in northern California, all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented
by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to import or export; deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce
in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce; or remove and reduce
to possession federally listed plant species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy
any such plant species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant
species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State
criminal trespass law. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant taxa are exempt from these prohibitions
provided that a statement ``of cultivated origin'' appears on the shipping containers. Certain exceptions apply
to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance
of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened plant species under
certain circumstances. The Service anticipates few trade permits would ever be sought or issued for the four species
because the plants are not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed plants
and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered
Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-6241; FAX 503/231-6243).




Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly
are sought concerning: 

(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to 

Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

pauciflora

, 

Navarretia leucocephala

 ssp. 

plieantha

, and 

Parvisedum leiocarpum

; 

(2) The location of any additional populations of these species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; 

(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of these species; and 

(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on these species. 

Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the comments and any additional information received

National Environmental Policy Act 



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant
to section 4(a) of the Act. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule is issued pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 to implement the requirements
for penalties for unallowable costs. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review
under Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



A. Background




The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-355, provides authorities that streamline the
acquisition process and minimize burdensome Government-unique requirements. Major changes that can be expected
in the acquisition process as a result of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act implementation include changes
in the areas of Commercial Item Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act,
and Introduction of the Federal Acquisition Computer Network.


This notice announces proposed FAR revisions developed under FAR Case 94-751, Penalties on Unallowable Indirect
Costs, involving Sections 2101 and 2151 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 which change the contract
value threshold for assessment of penalties on unallowable costs from $100,000 to $500,000 and expand the coverage
from only the Department of Defense to all executive agencies. The proposed rule applies to all executive agencies
and recognizes the increase in the contract value threshold for inclusion of the contract clause. With the exception
of the threshold value, the penalty provisions in the new law are the same as those implemented in the current Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement. Since there are interactions between this proposed rule and the new
rule proposed under FAR case 94-752 to create a new subsection 42.703-2, the two rules should be read together
to fully understand the changes.
 

The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of
the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not
scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94-751) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature
of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting
and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see 

ADDRESSES

 caption) on or before January 18, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a public
meeting on this rule should be scheduled.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act




This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitles
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq

., because most contracts awarded to small businesses are awarded through sealed bidding on a firm-fixed price basis.
The penalty provisions apply only to contracts which are not firm-fixed price. Also, the proposed rule would only
apply to contracts in excess of $500,000, eliminating the impact on contracts below that threshold. An Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected
FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately
and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq

. (FAR case 94-751), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act




The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq

.

Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR Parts 31, 42, and 52 be amended as set forth below:

1. The authority citation for 48 CFR Parts 31, 42, and 52 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c).



PART 31_CONTRACT COST PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES




2. Section 31.110 is added to read as follows:



31.110 

Indirect cost rate certification and penalties on unallowable costs.




Certain contracts require certification of the indirect cost rates proposed for progress or billing payment purposes.
If unallowable costs are included in final indirect cost settlement proposals, penalties may be assessed. See 42.703-2
and 42.709 for administrative procedures regarding the certification and penalty assessment provisions and for
related contract clause prescriptions.



PART 42_CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION



3. and 4. Sections 42.709 thru 42.709-6 are added to read as follows:



42.709 

Scope.




(a) This section implements 10 U.S.C. 2324 (a) through (d) and 41 U.S.C. 256 (a) through (d). It covers the assessment
of penalties against contractors which include unallowable indirect costs in_

(1) Final indirect cost rate proposals, or


(2) The final statement of costs incurred or estimated to be incurred under a fixed-price incentive contract.


(b) This section applies to all contracts in excess of $500,000, except fixed-price contracts without cost incentives
or any firm-fixed-price contracts for the purchase of commercial items.



42.709-1 

General.




(a) The following penalties apply to contracts covered by this section:


(1) If the indirect cost is expressly unallowable under a cost principle in the FAR, or an executive agency supplement
to the FAR, that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the penalty is equal to_

(i) The amount of the disallowed costs allocated to contracts that are subject to this section for which an indirect
cost proposal has been submitted, plus


(ii) Interest on the paid portion, if any, of the disallowance.


(2) If the indirect cost was determined to be unallowable for that contractor before proposal submission, the penalty
is two times the amount in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.


(b) These penalties are in addition to other administrative, civil, and criminal penalties provided by law.


(c) It is not necessary for unallowable costs to have been paid to the contractor in order to assess a penalty. 



42.709-2 

Responsibilities.




(a) The contracting officer assigned to administer a contract is responsible for_

(1) Determining whether the penalties in 42.709-1(a) should be assessed;


(2) Determining whether such penalties should be waived pursuant to 42.709-5; and


(3) Referring the matter to the appropriate criminal investigative organization for review and for appropriate
coordination of remedies, if there is evidence that the contractor knowingly submitted unallowable costs.


(b) The contract auditor, in the review and/or the determination of final indirect costs proposals for contracts
subject to this section, is responsible for_

(1) Recommending to the contracting officer which costs may be unallowable and subject to the penalties in 42.709-1(a);



(2) Providing rationale and supporting documentation for any recommendation; and 


(3) Referring the matter to the appropriate criminal investigative organization for review and for appropriate
coordination of remedies, if there is evidence that the contractor knowingly submitted unallowable costs. 



42.709-3 

Assessing the penalty. 



Unless a waiver is granted pursuant to 42.709-5, the cognizant contracting officer shall_

(a) Assess the penalty in 42.709-1(a)(1), when the submitted cost is expressly unallowable under a cost principle
in the FAR or an executive agency supplement that defines the allowability of specific selected costs; or

<TEXT>
 

(b) Assess the penalty in 42.709-1(a)(2), when the submitted cost was determined to be unallowable for that
contractor prior to submission of the proposal. Prior determinations of unallowability may be evidenced by_

(1) A DCAA Form 1, Notice of Contract Costs Suspended and/or Disapproved (see 48 CFR 242.705-2 [Defense FAR Supplement,
paragraph 242.705-2]) which the contractor elected not to appeal and was not withdrawn by DCAA, or any similar
notice;


(2) A contracting officer final decision which was not appealed;


(3) A prior executive agency Board of Contract Appeals or court decision involving the contractor, which upheld the
cost disallowance; or


(4) A determination or agreement of unallowability under 31.201-6.


(c) Issue a final decision (see 33.211) which includes a demand for payment of any penalty assessed under paragraphs
(a) or (b) of this section. The letter shall state that the determination is a final decision under the Disputes clause
of the contract. (Demanding payment of the penalty is separate from demanding repayment of any paid portion of the
disallowed cost.)



42.709-4 



Computing interest. 




For 42.709-1(a)(1)(ii), compute interest on any paid portion of the disallowed cost as follows:


(a) Consider the overpayment to have occurred, and intere
