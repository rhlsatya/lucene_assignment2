Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts From Taiwan; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Partial

ACTION: 

Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Partial Termination.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to a request by a petitioner and a respondent, the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting
an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan. The review covers seven
firms and the period September 1, 1992, through August 31, 1993. The review indicates the existence of margins for
the firms. 



As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between
United States price and foreign market value. 
Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.

2. When a company substantially cooperates with our requests for information and, substantially cooperates in verification,
but fails to provide the information requested in a timely manner or in the form required or was unable to substantiate
it, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise
from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review or if the firm has never before been investigated
or reviewed, the all others rate from the LTFV investigation; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for
the class or kind of merchandise for any firm from the same country of origin.




Chu Fong, Kuang, Transcend, and San Chien failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire. Accordingly, for
these companies we applied the first-tier BIA rate of 10.67 percent, which is the highest rate the Department found
in the original LTFV investigation.

Gourmet and Buxton provided us with responses to our questionnaires. However, the Department determined that the
data Gourmet submitted could not be reconciled to its audited financial statements. Reliance on the accounting system
used for the preparation of the audited financial statements is a key and vital part of the Department's determination
that a company's sales and constructed value data are credible. An ``in-house'' system which has not been audited
and is not used for the preparation of the financial statements or for any purpose other than internal deliberations
of the company does not assure the Department that such costs have been stated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, or that all sales and costs have been appropriately captured by the ``in-house'' system (

see Final Determination at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled
Carbon Steel Flat Products and Certain Cut-To-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Korea

, 58 FR 37186 (July 9, 1993)). Because their submissions were unreconcilable to their audited financial statements,
we have determined to apply BIA to Gourmet and Buxton, (

see

 Use of BIA memo to Holly Kuga, Director, Office of Antidumping Compliance). Accordingly, we applied the second-tier
BIA rate of 6.47 percent to Gourmet and 6.93 percent to Buxton. These rates represent the highest rates ever applicable
to each firm.

Everspring responded that it never sold the subject merchandise, and we have no information to contradict this claim.
If Everspring begins to sell the subject merchandise, it entries will receive the ``all other rate'' cash deposit
rate until we conduct an administrative review upon request.

Preliminary Results of Review



We have preliminarily determined that the following margins exist for the period September 1, 1992, through August
31, 1993:






The Department shall determine and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Upon completion of this review, the Department will issue appraisement instructions concerning these respondents
directly to the U.S. Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for the reviewed
firms will be those firms' rates established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously
reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific
rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a previous review,
or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for
the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the ``all others'' rate will remain at 6.93
percent as established in the LTFV investigation.

On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade, in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all other'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to apply the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing
cash deposit in all current and future administrative reviews. The ``all others'' rate in the LTFV investigation
was 6.93 percent.

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review.

Interested parties may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice, and a hearing
within 10 days of the date of publication. Any hearing requested will be held as early as convenient for parties but
not later than 44 days after date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs, or other written comments,
from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal
briefs and rebuttal comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs, may be filed not later than 37 days after
the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of review, including its results of its analysis
of issues raised in any such written comments.

This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

Final Results of Review


Upon review of comments submitted, the Department has determined that the following margin exists for the period
November 27, 1991, through May 31, 1993:






The Customs Service shall assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between
U.S. price and foreign market value may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will issue appraisement
instructions concerning the respondent directly to the U.S. Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of these amended final results
of administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act): (1)
The cash deposit rate for the reviewed firm will be 10.18%; and (2) the cash deposit rate for merchandise exported by
all other manufacturers and exporters who are not covered by this review will be the ``all others'' rate of 98.60 percent
established in the less-than-fair-value investigation, in accordance with 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States

, 822 F.Supp. 766 (1993), and 

Federal Mogul Corporation

, 822 F.Supp. 782 (1993).

These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative
review.

This notice serves as the final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with
the regulations and the terms of the APO is a sanctionable violation.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(f) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673(d)) and 19 CFR
353.28(c).

<DOCTITLE>Racing Plates (Aluminum Horseshoes) From Canada; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to a request by a respondent, the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the
antidumping finding on racing plates from Canada. The review covers one firm and the period February 1, 1993, through
January 31, 1994.



We have preliminarily determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary
results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping
duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and the FMV.


Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background 




On February 27, 1974 (39 FR 7579), the Department of Treasury published the antidumping finding of racing plates (aluminum
horseshoes) from Canada. The Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request
Administrative Review'' on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5390). The respondent, Equine Forgings Limited, requested that
we conduct an administrative review for the period February 1, 1993, through January 31, 1994. We published a notice
of ``Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11769) for
Equine Forgings Limited. 

The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended (the Tariff Act). 



Scope of the Review 



Imports covered by the review are shipments of racing plates (horseshoes) that are made of aluminum, may have cleats
or caulks, and come in a variety of sizes. They are used on race horses, polo, jumping, hunting, and other performing
horses, as differentiated from pleasure and work horses. During the review period such merchandise was classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 7616.90.00. This HTS item number is provided for convenience
and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 



United States Price 



In calculating USP, the Department used purchased price, as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act, since sales to
the first unrelated purchaser were made prior to the date of importation. Purchase price was based on the packed f.o.b.
price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight, U.S.
duty, and brokerage/handling charges. We adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice as outlined in 

Silicomanganse from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value 

(59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994). No other adjustments were claimed or allowed. 



Foreign Market Value 




In calculating FMV, we used home market price, as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, since sufficient quantities
of such or similar merchandise were sold in the home market to provide a basis for comparison. 

Home market price was based upon the packed f.o.b. price to unrelated purchasers in Canada, with appropriate deductions
for rebates. We adjusted for Canadian value-added tax in accordance with our decision 

Silicomanganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value 

(59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994). 

In accordance with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in 

The Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Grey Portland Cement v. United States, 

No. 93-1239, (January 5, 1994), we no longer deduct home market movement expenses from FMV pursuant to the Department's
inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Accordingly, we now adjust for such expenses under the circumstance-of-sale
provision of 19 CFR 352.56 and the ESP offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1)(2), as appropriate. As a result, we have
not adjusted for Equine Forging's reported home market inland freight as movement expenses. Rather, we have treated
Equine Forging's reported post-sale inland freight as a direct selling expense, which we have deducted from FMV.

Preliminary Results of Review


We have preliminarily determined that the following margin exists for the period February 1, 1993, through January
31, 1994:





The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Upon completion of this review, the Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the U.S. Customs
Service. 
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed
firm will be that firm's rate established in the final results of this administrative review. If the rate in the final
results of review for Equine Forgings Limited is 

de minimis,

 there will be no cash deposits required on shipments from this firm. (2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies
not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent
period. (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a previous review, or the original less than fair value
(LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent
period for the manufacturer of the merchandise.
On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade, in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to apply the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing
cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. In proceedings governed by antidumping findings,
unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined
that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative
review published by the Department (or that rate amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation)
as the ``all others'' rate for the purpose of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative
reviews.
Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping finding and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate
from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the ``all others'' rate for purposes of this review will be 6.77 percent, the
``new shipper'' rate established in the final results of administrative review published by the Department (47 FR
51779, November 17, 1982). 
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review.
Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice, and a hearing within
10 days of the date of publication. Any hearing requested will be held as early as convenient for parties but no later
than 44 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs, or other written comments,
from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal
briefs and rebuttal comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs, may be filed not later than 37 days after
the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of review, including its results of its analysis
of issues raised in any such written comments or at a hearing.
This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On September 29, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 49643) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on steel wire nails from New Zealand (52 FR 37196; October
5, 1987). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest
to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested
party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. 
Within the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke
this countervailing duty order. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met,
we will not revoke this order. 
This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4).

The Bilateral Textile Agreement of December 10, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and the People's
Republic of Bangladesh establishes limits for the periods February 1, 1994 and through December 31, 1994 and December
1, 1994 through December 31, 1994.

In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to amend the current limits
for certain categories for the new restraint period beginning on February 1, 1994 and extending through December
31, 1994. These amended limits include special carryforward, as well as flexibility previously applied. Also, the
new limit established for Categories 352/652 for the period December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 has been adjusted
for carryforward and special carryforward. As a result of the amendments to Categories 340/640 and 634, these limits,
which are currently filled, will re-open.

A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile
and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see 

Federal Register

 notice 58 FR 62645, published on November 29, 1993). Also see 59 FR 4039, published on January 28, 1994.

The letter to the Commissioner of Customs and the actions taken pursuant to it are not designed to implement all of the
provisions of the bilateral agreement, but are designed to assist only in the implementation of certain of its provisions.

1,210,000 dozen

Textile products in Categories 352/652 which have been exported to the United States prior to December 1, 1994 shall
not be subject to this directive.

Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to award an unsolicited application financial assistance award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Oak Ridge Operations Office, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2),
it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting
the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) under Cooperative Agreement Number DE-FC05-950R22363 to the United
States Automotive Materials Partnership (USAMP). USAMP is a consortium of Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company,
and General Motors Corporation. The proposed cooperative agreement will provide estimated funding in the amount
of $1,660,000 by the DOE for a project entitled, ``Automotive Lightweight Materials Program''. The purpose of this
effort is to define and conduct pre-competitive, vehicle-related research and development (R&D) in materials
and materials processing which will improve the competitiveness of the U.S. automotive industry. USAMP goals are
to develop several families of automotive materials that will impact strategic needs of the industry. These funds
will be matched equally by USAMP under this cooperative agreement.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The DOE has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f), that the unsolicited application for financial assistance
submitted by USAMP, is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed
project represents a unique idea, that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or
planned solicitation. The applicant is a consortium of the three largest automotive manufacturers in the United
States. These competitive companies have come together as several consortia under the United States Council for
Automotive Research (USCAR) to work together to jointly advance ``precompetitive'' automotive technologies.



The anticipated term of the proposed cooperative agreement is one year from the effective date of the award. This award
will not be made for at least 14 days after publication to allow for public comment.

Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company; Notice of Compliance Tariff Filing 




December 13, 1994.



Take notice that on December 9, 1994, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), tendered for
filing in response to the November 30, 1994, Letter Order issued in the above-referenced docket, Substitute First
Revised Sheet No. 243 to Second Revised Volume No. 1 of its FERC Gas Tariff. 

Williston Basin states that in the November 30 Letter Order, the Commission rejected Williston Basin's proposed
deletion of certain language in First Revised Sheet No. 243. Williston Basin states that on the apparent assumption
that the only change contained in First Revised Sheet No. 243 was the deletion of that language, the Letter Order rejected
the entirety of the sheet. However, it states, that sheet also contained changes that were necessitated by the changes
made to the tariff sheets that were accepted by the Letter Order. 

Williston Basin states that it is resubmitting the tariff sheet in question with the previously stricken language
included along with the changes necessary to conform Sheet No. 243 with the accepted tariff sheets. 

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before December 20, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

December 13, 1994.


Take notice that on December 2, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West
Virginia 26031, filed in an abbreviated application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate
of public convenience and necessity authorizing CNG to construct and operate, for the transmission of natural gas,
4.73 miles of 30-inch underground pipeline in Rotterdam Township, Schenectady County, New York, all as more fully
set forth in the application which is one file with the Commission and open to public inspection. The construction
cost is estimated by CNG to be $7,991,600 dollars. The proposed facility, designated CNG's TL-450 Extension
5, is needed by CNG to continue to maintain pressure requirements and meet post Order No. 636 obligations for Niagara
Mohawk Power Corporation's distribution system serving the Albany, New York area.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January
3, 1995, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C., 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceedings.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given.
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for CNG to appear or be represented
at the hearing.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed implementation of special refund procedures 

 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the proposed procedures for disbursement
of a total of $10,700,000, plus accrued interest, in alleged crude oil overcharges obtained pursuant to a Consent
Order entered into with Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration and Production Co., Case No.
VEF-0003 (Murphy). The OHA has tentatively determined that the funds obtained from Murphy, plus interest accrued,
will be distributed in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set
out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute
a total of $10,700,000, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of the Consent Order entered into
with Murphy on July 15, 1994. These funds were paid towards the settlement of alleged violations of the DOE petroleum
price and allocation regulations that were in effect from August 19, 1973, through January 28, 1981. 


 

The OHA has proposed to distribute these funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary
Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27,899 (August 4, 1986)(the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are
divided between the federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds
to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price
control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the volume of petroleum products they purchased
and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury. 


 Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties
are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding
will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E-234, 1000 Independence
Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.

Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy, 
Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 


 

Name of Firm: Murphy Oil Corp. / Murphy Oil USA, Inc. 


 Date of Filing: October 25, 1994 


 Case Number: VEF-0003 



 
December 12, 1994. 



 

On October 25, 1994 the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute
$10,700,000 remitted by Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration & Production Co. (collectively
referred to as ``Murphy''), pursuant to the Consent Order entered into between Murphy and the DOE on July 15, 1994.
In accordance with the procedural regulations codified at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requests
in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of alleged
regulatory violations which were resolved by the present Consent Order. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth
the OHA's plan to distribute these funds. 


 

I. Background 


 

Murphy is a major integrated refiner which produced and sold crude oil and a full range of refined petroleum products
during the period of federal price controls. As such, it was subject to the federal petroleum price and allocation
regulations. During that time, the ERA conducted an extensive audit of Murphy and issued an issue letter to Murphy
on September 29, 1976. ERA issued a Notice of Probable Violation to Murphy on January 28, 1981. ERA issued a Proposed
Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December 15, 1986, which Murphy contested before the OHA. 


 On February 9, 1987, Murphy and the DOE entered into a Consent Order which resolved disputes regarding Murphy's refined
petroleum product operations during the period the petroleum price and allocation regulations were in effect. 

See Murphy Oil Corp.,

 17 DOE  85,782 (1987) (the first Consent Order). The first Consent Order left the issue of Murphy's alleged violations
as a producer of crude oil unresolved. Those issues were decided by the OHA on June 17, 1992 when the OHA issued a modified
version of ERA's PRO as a Remedial Order (RO). 

See Murphy Oil Corp.,

 22 DOE  83,005 (1992). Murphy subsequently appealed the OHA's determination to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). On January 24, 1994 a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a Decision and Proposed Order (D&PO)
which modified the RO. 

See Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co., et al.,

 66 FERC  63,002 (1994). 


 On July 15, 1994, Murphy and the DOE entered into the present Consent Order, the second between Murphy and the DOE. This
second Consent Order, which does not modify or affect the terms of the first Consent Order, resolves all existing or
potential civil and administrative claims against Murphy for alleged violations of the federal petroleum price
and allocation regulations left unresolved by the first Consent Order. Under the terms of this second Consent Order,
Murphy has remitted $10,700,000 to the DOE, and all outstanding or potential claims by the DOE against Murphy have
been extinguished. These funds are being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department
of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution. 


 

II. Jurisdiction and Authority 


 

The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing
a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart
V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion
procedures to distribute refunds, 

see

 The Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501-07; 

Office of Enforcement,

 9 DOE  82,508 (1981); 

Office of Enforcement, 

8 DOE  82,597 (1981). 


 We have considered the ERA's Petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the second Murphy Consent
Order fund and have determined that such a proceeding is appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth
the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund. 


 

III. Proposed Refund Procedures 


 

A. Crude Oil Refund Policy 


 

We propose to distribute the Murphy funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy
in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the MSRP). The MSRP was issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement
Agreement. 

In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,

 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines  90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement).
The MSRP establishes that 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be remitted to the federal government,
another 40 percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may be initially reserved for the payment of claims by injured
parties. The MSRP also specifies that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid be
disbursed to the federal government and the states in equal amounts. 


 The OHA has utilized the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. 

See

 Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). This Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of
comments or objections to our proposed use of the MSRP as the groundwork for evaluating claims in crude oil refund proceedings.
Following this period, the OHA issued a Notice evaluating the numerous comments which it received pursuant to the
Order Implementing the MSRP. This Notice was published at 52 FR 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). 


 The April 10 Notice contained guidance to assist potential claimants wishing to file refund applications for crude
oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. Generally, all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase
volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981 crude oil price control period,
and (2) prove that they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. We also specified that end-users of petroleum
products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have been injured by the alleged
crude oil overcharges and need not submit any additional proof of injury beyond documentation of their purchase volumes.


See City of Columbus, Georgia,

 16 DOE  85,550 (1987). Additionally, we stated that crude oil refunds would be calculated on the basis of a per
gallon (or ``volumetric'') refund amount, which is obtained by dividing the crude oil refund pool by the total consumption
of petroleum products in the United States during the crude oil price control period. The OHA has adopted the refund
procedures outlined in the April 10 Notice in numerous cases. 

See, e.g., Texaco, Inc,

 19 DOE  85,200 (1989); 

Shell Oil Co.,

 17 DOE  85,204 (1988) (

Shell

); 

Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,

 14 DOE  85,475 (1986) (

Mountain Fuel

). 


 

B. Refund Claims 


 

We propose to adopt the DOE's standard crude oil refund procedures to distribute the monies remitted by Murphy. We
have chosen initially to reserve 20 percent of the fund, plus accrued interest, for direct refunds to claimants in
order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for injured parties. This reserve figure may later be reduced
if circumstances warrant. 


 The OHA will evaluate crude oil refund claims in a manner similar to that used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims
based on alleged refined product overcharges. 

See Mountain Fuel,

 14 DOE at 88,869. Under these procedures, claimants will be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum
products and prove they were injured as a result of the alleged violations.

We will adopt a presumption that the alleged crude oil overcharges were absorbed, rather than passed on, by applicants
which were (1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject to the
regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. 751-760h.
In order to receive a refund, end-user claimants need not submit any evidence of injury beyond documentation of their
purchase volumes. 

See Shell,

 17 DOE at 88,406. 


 Petroleum retailer, reseller, and refiner applicants must submit detailed evidence of injury, and they may not rely
upon the injury presumptions utilized in refined product cases. 

Id.

 These applicants, however, may use econometric evidence of the type found in the 

OHA Report on Stripper Well Overcharges,

 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines  90,507 (1985). 

See also

 PODRA  3003(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 4502(b)(2). If a claimant has executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to
one of the escrows established by the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, it has waived its rights to file an application
for Subpart V crude oil refund monies. 

See Mid-America Dairymen

 v. 

Herrington,

 878 F.2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines  26,617 (1989); 

In re: Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,

 707 F. Supp. 1267 (D. Kan.), 3 Fed Energy Guidelines  26,613 (1987). 


 As has been stated in prior Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will only be required to submit one application
for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds. 

See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc.,

 15 DOE  85,495 (1987). A party that has already submitted a claim to any other crude oil refund proceeding implemented
by the DOE need not file another claim. The prior application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings
finalized to date. 


 The DOE had previously established June 30, 1994 as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the
crude oil funds. 

See

 58 FR 26318 (May 3, 1993). Although that date has passed, it has been decided to re-open the crude proceeding. 

See

 59 Fed. Reg. 55656 (November 8, 1994). The new closing date for this proceeding has been tentatively set for June 3,
1996. 

Id.

 It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims at the rate of $.0008 per gallon. While we anticipate that
applicants that filed their claims before June 30, 1988 will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide
in the future whether claimants that filed later applications should receive additional refunds. 

See, e.g., Seneca Oil Co.,

 21 DOE  85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 


 

C. Payments to the Federal Government and the States 


 

Under the terms of the MSRP, we propose that the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil overcharge amounts
subject to this Proposed Decision, plus accrued interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and the
federal government for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum
products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive
is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines  90,509 at 90,687.
When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude
oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement. 


 It Is Therefore Ordered That: 


 The funds remitted by Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration & Production Co. pursuant
to the Consent Order entered into with the DOE on July 15, 1994 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing
Decision.

Proposed Settlement Agreement; PM-10 SIP for the State of Arizona


Agency: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed settlement agreement; request for public comment.




Summary: 

In accordance with Section 113(g) of the Clean Air Act (``Act''), notice is hereby given of a proposed settlement agreement
concerning litigation instituted against the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') by Edward M. Ober, through
his counsel David S. Baron of the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest (hereafter ``ACLPI''). The lawsuit
concerns EPA's alleged failure to perform a nondiscretionary duty with respect to promulgating a PM-10 final
implementation plan (``FIP'') for the Phoenix, Arizona Planning Area. The proposed settlement agreement provides
that EPA shall sign a Notice of Final Rulemaking (``NFRM'' regarding the moderate nonattainment area PM-10
State implementation plan (``SIP'') submitted by the State of Arizona for the Phoenix Planning Area, respecting
which a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'') was published at 59 FR 38402 (July 28, 1994), no later than March 1,
1995. If final rulemaking action by EPA results in disapproval of the SIP, in whole or in part, EPA would agree to sign
a NFRM promulgating a FIP that corrects the disapproved portions of the SIP no later than March 1, 1996, unless prior
to that date EPA has fully approved a SIP revision that corrects the deficiency that formed the basis for the disapproval
action. If EPA takes final rulemaking action approving the SIP, in whole or in part, the parties will file a joint motion
to stay litigation in the district court pending the outcome of appellate review. Additionally, it after appellate
review EPA's approval is vacated, the parties will file a joint motion to lift the stay, and plaintiffs would be free
to pursue litigation of their original FIP claims without being required to file an addtional 60-day notice of intent
to sue or a new complaint. If, however, EPA is upheld on appellate review, plaintiffs shall, within 30 days, file a motion
to dismiss or withdraw their complaint. 


For a period of thirty [30] days following the date of publication of this notice, the Agency will receive written comments
relating to the settlement agreement. EPA or the Department of Justice may withhold or withdraw consent to the proposed
settlement agreement in the comments disclose facts or circumstances that indicate that such consent is inappropriate,
improper, inadequate, or inconsistent with the requirements of the Act. 
Copies of the settlement agreement are available from Phyllis Cochran, Air and Radiation Division (2344), Office
of General Counsel, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20460, (202) 260-7606.
Written comments should be sent to Michael A. Prosper at the above address and must be submitted on or before January
18, 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Arizona: Final Determination of Adequacy of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Final Determination of Full Program Adequacy for Arizona's Application. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 6945 (c)(1)(B), requires States to develop and implement regulatory programs
to ensure that municipal solid waste landfill facilities (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or
small quantity generator hazardous waste will comply with the revised federal MSWLF criteria, codified at 40 CFR
Part 258 (the Federal MSWLF Criteria). Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate regulatory programs for MSWLFs. 


Approved State MSWLF programs provide interaction between the State and MSWLF owners and operators regarding site-specific
approval conditions. Only owners or operators located in States with approved programs can use the site-specific
flexibility provided by 40 CFR Part 258 to the extent the state program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that the
Federal MSWLF Criteria apply to all MSWLFs, regardless of the approval status of any state program or individual facility.

Arizona applied for a determination of adequacy under Section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Arizona's application and
issued for public comment a tentative determination that Arizona's program is adequate to ensure compliance with
the revised MSWLF criteria. Based on a thorough review of Arizona's MSWLF program and the fact that the only comments
EPA received supported the tentative determination, EPA is today issuing a final determination that Arizona's MSWLF
program is adequate.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated the Federal MSWLF Criteria, codified at 40 CFR part 258. Subtitle D of RCRA, 42 U.S.C.
6941-6949(a), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop
regulatory programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal MSWLF Criteria. Section 4005 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C.
6945, also requires that EPA determine the adequacy of State MSWLF programs to ensure that facilities comply with
the Federal MSWLF Criteria. To facilitate this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State and Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially
approve, State and Tribal landfill regulatory programs. 
EPA has approved, and will continue to approve, State MSWLF programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. Prior to
the promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will continue to be made on the basis of statutory authorities
and requirements. EPA interprets the statutory requirements for States to develop ``adequate'' regulatory programs
to impose several minimum standards. First, each State must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs
that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State also must provide
for public participation in facility approval and enforcement as required in Section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6974(b).
Finally, the State must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific
action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. 
EPA Regions will determine whether a State has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined
above. EPA expects States to meet all of the criteria for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval
to a MSWLF program. In addition, States may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. 
On May 6, 1994, Arizona submitted an application for program adequacy determination. On September 15, 1994, EPA published
a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Arizona's program. Further background on the tentative
determination of adequacy appears at 59 FR 47332 (September 15, 1994).

Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment. EPA
received two comments supporting the determination, but no requests for a public meeting. 


B. Decision 


In the tentative determination, EPA proposed to fully approve Arizona's MSWLF program. Arizona's application for
adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. The State of
Arizona has the authority to enforce the requirements of its MSWLF program at all MSWLFs in the State, with the exception
of those located on Tribal Lands. Accordingly, Arizona is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of
its MSWLF program. 
In addition to enforcement by the States, Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions
of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF Criteria at 40 CFR part 258 independent of any state enforcement
program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying
with provisions in a state program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the federal criteria.
See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). 
Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's MSWLF program are already in effect as a matter of state law.
EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements on the regulated community, nor do these requirements become
enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to give notice prior to making its approval
effective. 


Compliance With Executive Order 12291


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.





Authority: 

This notice is issued under the authority of Sections 2002, 4005 and 4007 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended,
42 U.S.C. 6912, 6945, 6947.

SUBJECT: Suspension of Registration of Pesticide Product(s) Containing 

XXXXXXXX

 for Failure to Comply with the Section 4 Phase 5 Reregistration Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice for 

XXXXXXX

 Dated 

XXXXXXXX

. 




Dear Sir/Madam:



This letter gives you notice that the pesticide product registrations listed in Attachment I will be suspended 30
days from your receipt of this letter unless you take steps within that time to prevent this Notice from automatically
becoming a final and effective order of suspension. The Agency's authority for suspending the registrations of your
products is section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Upon becoming
a final and effective order of suspension, any violation of the order will be an unlawful act under section 12(a)(2)(J)
of FIFRA.
You are receiving this Notice of Intent to Suspend because you have failed to comply with the terms of the Phase 5 Registration
Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice imposed pursuant to section 4(g)(2)(b) and section 3(c)(2)(B) of FIFRA.

The specific basis for issuance of this Notice is stated in the Explanatory Appendix (Attachment III) to this Notice.
Affected products and the requirements which you failed to satisfy are listed and described in the following three
attachments:
Attachment I Suspension Report - Product List
Attachment II Suspension Report - Requirement List
Attachment III Suspension Report - Explanatory Appendix
The suspension of the registration of each product listed in Attachment I will become final unless at least one of the
following actions is completed.
1. You may avoid suspension under this Notice if you or another person adversely affected by this Notice properly request
a hearing within 30 days of your receipt of this Notice. If you request a hearing, it will be conducted in accordance
with the requirements of section 6(d) of FIFRA and the Agency's procedural regulations in 40 CFR part 164.
Section 3(c)(2)(B), however, provides that the only allowable issues which may be addressed at the hearing are whether
you have failed to take the actions which are the bases of this Notice and whether the Agency's decision regarding the
disposition of existing stocks is consistent with FIFRA. Therefore, no substantive allegation or legal argument
concerning other issues, including but not limited to the Agency's original decision to require the submission of
data or other information, the need for or utility of any of the required data or other information or deadlines imposed,
and the risks and benefits associated with continued registration of the affected product, may be considered in the
proceeding. The Administrative Law Judge shall by order dismiss any objections which have no bearing on the allowable
issues which may be considered in the proceeding.
Section 3(c)(2)(B)(iv) of FIFRA provides that any hearing must be held and a determination issued within 75 days after
receipt of a hearing request. This 75-day period may not be extended unless all parties in the proceeding stipulate
to such an extension. If a hearing is properly requested, the Agency will issue a final order at the conclusion of the
hearing governing the suspension of your products.
A request for a hearing pursuant to this Notice must (1) include specific objections which pertain to the allowable
issues which may be heard at the hearing, (2) identify the registrations for which a hearing is requested, and (3) set
forth all necessary supporting facts pertaining to any of the objections which you have identified in your request
for a hearing. If a hearing is requested by any person other than the registrant, that person must also state specifically
why he asserts that he would be adversely affected by the suspension action described in this Notice. Three copies
of the request must be submitted to: Hearing Clerk, Mail Code 1900, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St.,
SW., Washington, DC 20460, and an additional copy should be sent to the signatory listed below. The request must be


received

 by the Hearing Clerk by the 30th day from your receipt of this Notice in order to be legally effective. The 30-day
time limit is established by FIFRA and cannot be extended for any reason. Failure to meet the 30-day time limit
will result in automatic suspension of your registration(s) by operation of law and, under such circumstances, the
suspension of the registration for your affected product(s) will be final and effective at the close of business 30
days after your receipt of this Notice and will not be subject to further administrative review.
The Agency's Rules of Practice at 40 CFR 164.7 forbid anyone who may take part in deciding this case, at any stage of the
proceeding, from discussing the merits of the proceeding 

ex parte

 with any party or with any person who has been connected with the preparation or presentation of the proceeding as an
advocate or in any investigative or expert capacity, or with any of their representatives. Accordingly, the following
EPA offices, and the staffs thereof, are designated as judicial staff to perform the judicial function of EPA in any
administrative hearings on this Notice of Intent to Suspend: The Office of the Administrative Law Judges, the Office
of the Judicial Officer, the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, and the members of the staff in the immediate
offices of the Administrator and Deputy Administrator. None of the persons designated as the judicial staff shall
have any 

ex parte

 communication with trial staff or any other interested person not employed by EPA on the merits of any of the issues
involved in this proceeding, without fully complying with the applicable regulations.
2. You may also avoid suspension if, within 30 days of your receipt of this Notice, the Agency determines that you have
taken appropriate steps to comply with the Section 4 Phase 5 Reregistration Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice
requirements. In order to avoid suspension under this option, you must satisfactorily comply with Attachment II,
Requirement List, for each product by submitting all required supporting data/information described in Attachment
II and in the Explanatory Appendix (Attachment III) to the following address (preferably by certified mail):


Office of Compliance, Agriculture and Ecosystems Division, Mail Code 2225A, Environmental Protection Agency,
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 


For you to avoid automatic suspension under this Notice, the Agency must also determine within the applicable 30-day
period that you have satisfied the requirements that are the bases of this Notice and so notify you in writing. You should
submit the necessary data/information as quickly as possible for there to be any chance the Agency will be able to make
the necessary determination in time to avoid suspension of your product(s).
The suspension of the registration(s) of your company's product(s) pursuant to this Notice will be rescinded when
the Agency determines you have complied fully with the requirements which were the bases of this Notice. Such compliance
may only be achieved by submission of the data/information described in the attachments to the signatory below.
Your product will remain suspended, however, until the Agency determines you are in compliance with the requirements
which are the bases of this Notice and so informs you in writing.
After the suspension becomes final and effective, the registrant subject to this Notice, including all supplemental
registrants of product(s) listed in Attachment I, may not legally distribute, sell, use, offer for sale, hold for
sale, ship, deliver for shipment, or receive and (having so received) deliver or offer to deliver, to any person, the
product(s) listed in Attachment I.
Persons other than the registrant subject to this Notice, as defined in the preceding sentence, may continue to distribute,
sell, use, offer for sale, hold for sale, ship, deliver for shipment, or receive and (having so received) deliver or
offer to deliver, to any person, the product(s) listed in Attachment I.
Nothing in this Notice authorizes any person to distribute, sell, use, offer for sale, hold for sale, ship, deliver
for shipment, or receive and (having so received) deliver or offer to deliver, to any person, the product(s) listed
in Attachment I in any manner which would have been unlawful prior to the suspension.
If the registrations of your products listed in Attachment I are currently suspended as a result of failure to comply
with another Section 4 Data Requirements Notice or Section 3(c)(2)(B) Data Call-In Notice, this Notice, when it becomes
a final and effective order of suspension, will be in addition to any existing suspension, i.e., all requirements
which are the bases of the suspension must be satisfied before the registration will be reinstated.
You are reminded that it is your responsibility as the basic registrant to notify all supplementary registered distributors
of your basic registered product that this suspension action also applies to their supplementary registered products
and that you may be held liable for violations committed by your distributors. If you have any questions about the requirements
and procedures set forth in this suspension notice or in the subject Section 4 Data Requirements Notice, please contact
Francisca Liem at (202) 564-2365.


Sincerely yours,




Director, Agriculture and Ecosystem Division

IV. Attachment III Suspension Report_Explanatory Appendix


A discussion of the basis for the Notice of Intent to Suspend sent to each affected registrant follows: 



Chlorinated Isocyanurates



On May 7, 1993, the EPA issued the Phase 5 Reregistration Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice imposed pursuant
to section 4(g)(2)(B) and 3(c)(2)(B) of FIFRA which required registrants of products containing chlorinated isocyanurate
used as the active ingredient to develop and submit certain data. These data/information were determined to be necessary
to satisfy reregistration data requirements of section 4(g). Failure to comply with the requirements of a Phase 5
Reregistration Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice is a basis for suspension under section 3(c)(2)(B) of FIFRA.
The Chlorinated Isocyanurate Phase 5 Reregistration Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice dated May 7, 1993,
required each affected registrant to submit data/information to the Agency to address each of the data requirements.
Those data/information were required to be received by the Agency within 8 months of the registrant's receipt of the
Notice. Because you have failed to submit appropriate or adequate data/information within the time provided for
the data/information requirements listed in Attachment II, the Agency is issuing this Notice of Intent to Suspend.




V. Conclusions


EPA has issued Notices of Intent to Suspend on the dates indicated. Any further information regarding these Notices
may be obtained from the contact person noted above.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 20, 1994, EPA received an application from Ciba Geigy, Seed Division to amend their experimental use permit
(EUP) for a transgenic plant pesticide by adding test sites in Texas. The Agency has determined that this application
may be of regional and national significance. Therefore in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting
public comments on this application. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 20, 1994, EPA received an application to amend an EUP from Ciba-Geigy Corporation, Seed Division (Ciba
Seeds), P.O. Box 12257, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709-2257. The EUP application is assigned
EPA File Symbol 66736-EUP-1. In the 

Federal Register

 of November 2, 1994 (59 FR 54904), EPA announced issuance of an extension for this EUP. The approved EUP extension allows
the use of 197.1 grams of the Bacillus thuringiensis 

d

-endotoxin (produced by a bacterially derived CryIA(b) gene in corn plants) in seeds planted on 190 acres of corn to
evaluate the control of the European corn borer and other lepidopteran pests. The program is currently authorized
only in the States of California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Dakota, and Wisconsin and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The experimental use permit extension is effective for
plantings from April 12, 1994 to March 31, 1995, and associated activities such as collection of field data and harvesting
and processing of seed after last planting. Corn grown under this permit is not permitted to enter commerce. Ciba Seeds
has applied to amend the EUP by diverting plantings of up to 45 acres of transgenic Bt corn from previously authorized
plantings in Hawaii and Illinois to Texas. Thus, the additional test sites will not increase the total acreage authorized
under the current EUP. 


Upon review of the Ciba Seeds application, any comments received in response to this notice and any other relevant
information, the U.S. EPA will set conditions under which the experiments will be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP
amendment approval will be announced in the 

Federal Register

.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of Great Lakes Dredged Material Testing and Evaluation Manual and Request for Comment</DOCTITLE>



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of and requests public comment on the draft testing manual entitled ``Great
Lakes Dredged Material Testing and Evaluation Manual (Draft)'' (draft Great Lakes Manual). The manual was prepared
by an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)/Army Corps of Engineers (CE) workgroup comprised of staff with scientific
and/or programmatic expertise related to Great Lakes dredged material discharge activities. This manual supplements
the manual entitled ``Evaluation of Dredged Material Proposed for Discharge in Waters of the U.S._Testing Manual
(Draft)'' (draft National Manual) which was noticed for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on July 21, 1994 (59 FR 37234). The draft Great Lakes manual contains more specific information for the Great Lakes
system, including detailed bioassay test protocols. Both manuals were issued pursuant to the provisions of section
404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act and 40 CFR part 230. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Proposed discharges of dredged or fill material in Great Lakes Waters must be evaluated to determine the potential
environmental impacts of such activities. Specifically, Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
of 1972, Public Law 92-500, as amended by the CWA, Public Law 95-217, requires that the discharge of dredged
or fill material into waters of the U.S. be permitted by the CE. EPA has the primary role in developing the environmental
guidelines_the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines)_in conjunction with the CE, by which permit applications
must be evaluated. The Guidelines are published at 40 CFR Part 230. Fundamental to the Guidelines is the precept that
dredged or fill material should not be discharged into the aquatic ecosystem, unless it can be demonstrated that such
a discharge will not have an unacceptable adverse impact either individually or in combination with known and/or
probable impacts of other activities affecting the ecosystems of concern. 



Dredged material testing is part of the larger evaluation of a proposed discharge activity to determine its compliance
with the Guidelines. Sections 230.60 and 230.61 of the Guidelines provide the basis for certain contaminant-related
factual determinations regarding the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge. The draft Great
Lakes Manual provides regional guidance on the testing provision of the Guidelines, supplementing the draft National
Manual which was noticed for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on July 21, 1994 (59 FR 37234). The manuals detail the physical, chemical, and biological evaluation procedures outlined
in   230.60 and 230.61, including technical guidance on sampling and handling, quality assurance, chemical
and physical analysis, and biological effects testing. The draft Great Lakes Manual contains more specific information
for the Great Lakes system, including detailed bioassay test protocols. Conclusions reached utilizing the manuals
will be used to make factual determinations of the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge of dredged
material. 
The final Great Lakes Manual will be published in approximately 6 months after review and consideration of the comments
received on this draft and in coordination with the development of the final National Manual.

<DOCTITLE>Public Water System Supervision Program Revision for the State of Montana</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Public notice is hereby given in accordance with the provisions of section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended,
42 U.S.C. 300g-2, and 40 CFR part 142, Subpart B_Primary Enforcement Responsibility, that the State of Montana
has revised its Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) Primacy Program. Montana's PWSS program, administered by
the Drinking Water Section of the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, has adopted regulations for total
coliforms, Phase II (7 inorganic and 26 organic chemicals), Phase IIb (1 inorganic and 4 organic chemicals), Phase
V (5 inorganic and 18 organic chemicals), and lead and copper that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water
Regulations (NPDWR) in 49 CFR Part 141 for total coliforms (FR Vol. 54, No. 124, June 29, 1989, Pg. 27544-27568),
Phase II (FR Vol. 56, No. 20, January 30, 1991, Pg. 3526-3597), Phase IIb (FR Vol. 56, No. 126, July 1, 1991, Pg.
30266-30281), Phase V (FR Vol. 57, No. 138, July 17, 1992, Pg. 31776-31849), and for lead and copper (FR
Vol. 56, No. 110, June 7, 1991, Pg. 26460-26564). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed its
review of Montana's primacy revisions and has determined that they are no less stringent than the NPDWRs. EPA therefore
approves Montana's primacy revisions for Total Coliforms, Phase II, IIb, V, and Lead and Copper Rules. This determination
shall become effective January 18, 1995. 


Any interested parties are invited to submit written comments on this determination, and may request a public hearing
on or before January 18, 1995. If a public hearing is requested and granted, this determination shall not become effective
until such time following the hearing that the Regional Administrator issues an order affirming or rescinding this
action.

Requests for a public hearing should be addressed to: William P. Yellowtail, Regional Administrator, c/o Marty Swickard
(8WM-DW), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, CO 80202-2466.

Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. However, if a substantial
request is made within thirty (30) days after this notice, a public hearing will be held.

Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) the name, address, and telephone number of the individual,
organization, or other entity requesting a hearing; (2) a brief statement of the requesting person's interest in
the Regional Administrator's determination and of information that the requesting person intends to submit at such
hearing; and (3) the signature of the individual making the request, or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization
or other entity, the signature of the responsible official of the organization or other entity.

Notice of any hearing shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the time schedule for the hearing. Such
notice will be made by the Regional Administrator in the 

Federal Register

 and in newspapers of general circulation in the State of Montana. A notice will also be sent to the person(s) requesting
the hearing as well as to the State of Montana. The hearing notice will include a statement of purpose, information
regarding time and location, and the address and telephone number where interested persons may obtain further information.
The Regional Administrator will issue an order affirming or rescinding his determination upon review of the hearing
record. Should the determination be affirmed, it will become effective as of the date of the order.

Should no timely and appropriate request for a hearing be received, and the Regional Administrator does not elect
to hold a hearing on his own motion, this determination shall become effective on January 18, 1995. Please bring this
notice to the attention of any persons known by you to have an interest in this determination.

All documents relating to this determination are available for inspection at the following locations: (1) U.S. EPA
Region VIII, Drinking Water Branch, 999 18th Street (4th floor), Denver, Colorado; (2) Department of Health and Environmental
Sciences, Drinking Water Section, 1400 Broadway, Room A206, Helena, Montana.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Gateway Educational Products,
Ltd. (``Gateway''), and John Shanahan and John Herlihy, officers of Gateway.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns the ``Hooked on Phonics'' reading program (``HOP''). The Commission's proposed complaint
alleges that the respondents represented in their advertisements and promotional materials that HOP will quickly
and easily teach persons with reading problems or disabilities to read, regardless of the nature of the problem or
disability; is effective for teaching persons with learning disabilities, including dyslexia and attention deficit
disorders, to read; will cause users with reading problems or disabilities to achieve significant improvement in
reading levels and classroom grades; is effective for teaching persons in a home setting to read, without the need
for additional assistance such as a teacher or tutor; is effective for teaching reading comprehension skills; has
helped nearly one million students to learn to read at home; and that testimonials or endorsements appearing in the
HOP advertising reflect consumers' typical or ordinary experiences using HOP. The complaint alleges that the respondents
falsely represented that they relied upon a reasonable basis for these representations.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar acts
and practices in the future. Part I requires respondents to possess adequate substantiation for the HOP efficacy
claims alleged in the complaint, as well as for any claims that any educational program or product will be effective
for teaching reading or provides any other educational benefit. The substantiation level required is competent
and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence.

Part II of the proposed order prohibits the respondents, in advertising any educational program or product, from
representing that any endorsement represents the typical experience of consumers who use the program or product,
unless the claim is substantiated.

Parts III through VII relate to the respondents' obligations to retain substantiation materials; to notify the Commission
of changes in corporate identity, or in the case of the individuals, employment; to distribute copies of the order
to certain employees; and to file compliance reports with the Commission.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed Consent Agreement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, three
New York-based companies and their officer to divest six supermarkets, within 12 months, to a Commission-approved
acquirer or acquirers. If the respondents fail to satisfy the divestiture requirements, the proposed order would
permit the Commission to appoint a trustee to divest supermarkets to satisfy the terms of the order. The consent agreement
also would prohibit the respondents, for ten years, from acquiring, without prior Commission approval, any supermarket
or any interest in an entity that owns or operates a supermarket in New York County south of 116th Street. In addition,
the respondents, for ten years, would be prohibited from entering into or enforcing any agreement that restricts
the ability of any person acquiring any supermarket owned or operated by any respondent in New York County south of
116th Street.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to section 6(f) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 721, 15 U.S.C. 46 and  3.25(f) of the Commission's

order to cease and desist, having been filed with and accepted, subject to final approval, by the Commission, has been
placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days. Public comment is invited. Such comments or views will be
considered by the Commission and will be available for inspection and copying at its principal office in accordance
with  4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission's rules of practice (16 CFR 4.9(b)(ii)).

It is further ordered that: 
A. If respondents have not divested, absolutely and in good faith and with the Commission's prior approval, such assets
to be divested to comply with Paragraph II. of this order within twelve months from the date this order becomes final,
the Commission may appoint a trustee to divest any of the supermarkets listed in Paragraph II. (and all assets, leases,
properties, business and goodwill, tangible and intangible, utilized in the distribution or sale of groceries at
the listed locations) that are owned or operated by any respondent at the time of the appointment of the trustee in order
to satisfy the requirements of Paragraph II. A. and II. B. of this order. In the event that the Commission or the Attorney
General brings an action pursuant to section 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(l), or any other
statute enforced by the Commission, respondents shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither
the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission
or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed
trustee, pursuant to section 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission,
for any failure by the respondents to comply with this order.
B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III. A. of this order, respondents shall
consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities:

1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of respondents, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If respondents
have not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten
(10) days after written notice by the staff of the Commission to respondents of the identity of any proposed trustee,
respondents shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee.
2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest
any of the supermarkets listed in Paragraph II (and all assets, leases, properties, business and goodwill, tangible
and intangible, utilized in the distribution or sale of groceries at the listed locations) that are owned or operated
by any respondent at the time of the appointment of the trustee in order to comply with Paragraph II. of this order.

3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, respondents shall execute a trust agreement that, subject
to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the
trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestitures required by Paragraph II.
of this order. Such trust agreement may include a confidentiality agreement.

4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission or court approves the trust agreement described
in Paragraph III. B. 3. to accomplish the divestitures, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission.
If, however, at the end of the twelve-month period, the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that
divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or,
in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court; provided, however, the Commission may extend this 12-month
period only one (1) time for one (1) year.

5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities related to any of
the supermarkets listed in Paragraph II. (and all assets, leases, properties, business and goodwill, tangible and
intangible, utilized in the distribution or sale of groceries at the listed locations) or to any other relevant information,
as the trustee may request. Respondents shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably
request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Respondents shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's
accomplishment of the divestitures. Any delays in divestiture caused by respondents shall extend the time for divestiture
under this Paragraph in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee,
by the court. 

6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract
that is submitted to the Commission, subject to respondents' absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at
no minimum price. The divestitures shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set out in Paragraph
II. of this order; provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers, for any particular supermarket to
be divested, from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring
entity for such supermarket, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity or entities selected by respondents
from among those approved by the Commission. 

7. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of respondents, on such reasonable
and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have the authority to employ,
at the cost and expense of respondents, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business
brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are necessary to carry out the trustee's duties
and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the sale and all expenses incurred. After
approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account of the trustee,
including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of the respondents, and
the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on
a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the assets to be divested to satisfy Paragraph II.
of this order. 

8. Respondents shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, including all reasonable
fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense or any claim, whether
or not resulting in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses
result from misfeasance, gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee. 

9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted for public comment from Red Apple Companies, Inc., John
A. Catsimatidis, Supermarket Acquisition Corporation and Sloan's Supermarkets, Inc. (a/k/a Designcraft Industries,
Inc.) (collectively referred to as the ``Red Apple respondents'') an agreement containing a proposed consent order.
The Commission is placing the agreement containing a proposed consent order on the public record for sixty (60) days
for receipt of comments by interested persons.

Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.

The Commission issued a complaint in this matter on May 27, 1994, stating that it has reason to believe that the Red Apple
respondents' acquisitions of Sloan's supermarkets between 1991 and 1993 in residential neighborhoods in New York
County, New York, located within the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side, Chelsea, and Greenwich Village would substantially
lessen competition in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and section 5 of the FTC Act,
as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. The agreement containing a proposed consent order would, if issued by the Commission, settle
the charges alleged in the Commission's complaint.

The proposed consent order requires the Red Apple respondents to divest a combination of six supermarkets from two
lists of supermarkets organized by geographic market. The listed supermarkets are all located in the Upper East Side,
the Upper West Side, Chelsea, and Greenwich Village. Under the proposed consent order, the Red Apple respondents
must divest one supermarket within each of the four geographic markets and two additional supermarkets in those geographic
markets. The proposed consent order gives the Red Apple respondents 12 months to divest these supermarkets to an acquirer
or acquirers that receive the prior approval of the Commission. Under the proposed consent order, if the Red Apple
respondents fail to satisfy the divestiture provisions, the Commission may appoint a trustee to divest supermarkets
to satisfy the terms of the order.

The proposed consent order also prohibits the Red Apple respondents, for a ten-year period, from acquiring, without
prior approval from the Commission, any supermarket (or leasehold interest in a supermarket, or stock, share capital,
equity or other interest in an entity that owns or operates a supermarket) located in new York County south of 116th
Street. The word ``supermarket'' is defined in the order.

The proposed consent order also prohibits the Red Apple respondents, for a ten-year period, from entering into or
enforcing any agreement that restricts the ability of any person acquiring any supermarket owned or operated by any
respondent in New York County south of 116th Street to operate a supermarket or retail food store.

Under the proposed consent order, the Red Apple respondents are required to provide to the Commission a report of compliance
with the order within sixty (60) days following the date the order becomes final, every sixty (60) days thereafter
until the divestitures are completed, and annually for a period of ten years.

It is anticipated that the order will resolve the competitive problems alleged in the complaint. The purpose of this
analysis is to invite public comment on the proposed consent order to aid the Commission in its determination of whether
it should make final the proposed consent order contained in the agreement.

This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed consent order,
nor is it intended to modify the terms of the agreement and proposed consent order in any way.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Acquisition Policy, GSA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Title VII of the ``Business Opportunity Development Act of 1988'' (Public Law 100-656) established the Small
Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and designated nine (9) agencies, including GSA, to conduct the
program over a four (4) year period from January 1, 1989 to December 31, 1992. The Small Business Opportunity Enhancement
Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-366) extended the demonstration program until September 1996 and made certain changes
in the procedures for operation of the demonstration program. The law designated four (4) industry groups for testing
whether the competitive capability of the specified industry groups will enable them to successfully compete on
an unrestricted basis. The four (4) industry groups are: Construction (except dredging); architectural and engineering
(A&E) services (including surveying and mapping); refuse systems and related services (limited to trash/garbage
collection); and non-nuclear ship repair. Under the program, when a participating agency misses its small business
participation goal, restricted competition is reinstituted only for those contracting activities that failed
to attain the goal. The small business goal is 40 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for construction, trash/garbage
collection services, and non-nuclear ship repair and 35 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for architect-engineer
services. This notice announces modifications to GSA's solicitation practices under the demonstration program
based on a review of the agency's performance during the period from October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1994. Modifications
to solicitation practices are outlined in the Supplementary Information section below and apply to solicitations
issued on or after January 1, 1995.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<DOCTITLE>Publication of OIG Special Fraud Alerts </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Inspector General, HHS. 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This 

Federal Register

 notice sets forth the 5 previously-developed Special Fraud Alerts issued directly to the health care provider community
by the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG). In keeping with the OIG's goal and intent of publicizing its concern about
possible widespread and abusive health care industry practices, and seeking wider dissemination of this information
to the general public, we are republishing the main content of these Special Fraud Alerts in the 

Federal Register

. This notice also serves to alert the general public of our intention to publish all future OIG Special Fraud Alerts
in this same manner, in addition to the current method used to distribute this material to Medicare and State health
care program providers.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The Use of Fraud Alerts by the OIG 



Over the years, the OIG has used fraud alerts as a vehicle to identify fraudulent and abusive practices within the health
care industry. The majority of these fraud alerts are disseminated internally to the OIG's Office of Investigations
and other agencies within the Department. However, the OIG has also developed and issued Special Fraud Alerts intended
for extensive distribution directly to the health care provider community. 



Special Fraud Alerts 



Since 1988, the OIG has issued 5 ``Special Fraud Alerts'' addressing specific trends of health care fraud and certain
practices of an industry-wide character. Specifically, the OIG Special Fraud Alerts have served to provide general
guidance to the health care industry on violations of Federal law (including various aspects of the anti-kickback
statute), as well as to provide additional insight to the Medicare carrier fraud units in identifying health care
fraud schemes. 

In developing these Special Fraud Alerts, the OIG relies on a number of sources, such as studies or management and program
evaluations conducted by the OIG's Office of Evaluation and Inspections. In addition, the OIG may consult with experts
in the subject field, including those within the OIG, other agencies of the Department, other Federal and State agencies,
and from those in the health care industry. 



The Nature of Past Special Fraud Alerts 



For the most part, the OIG Special Fraud Alerts have been reserved for national trends in health care fraud and have
addressed potential violations of the Medicare and State health care programs' anti-kickback statute. The Special
Fraud Alerts have addressed the following topic areas that could violate the anti-kickback statute: 

 Joint venture arrangements;
 Routine waiver of Medicare Part B copayments and 
deductibles;
 Hospital incentives to referring physicians;
 Prescription drug marketing practices;
 Arrangements for the provision of clinical laboratory services. 



II. Federal Register Publication of Special Fraud Alerts 



In the past, the OIG has always printed and distributed copies of these Special Fraud Alerts directly to all Medicare
program providers. While the OIG Special Fraud Alerts have been designed to be available to all affected program providers,
we believe it is useful to publicize these various issues and concerns involving potential abusive health care industry
practices to a more widespread audience. For this reason, we are using this 

Federal Register

 notice as a vehicle to reprint the substance of the 5 previously-issued Special Fraud Alerts cited above. 
It is our intention to use this same 

Federal Register

 form for publishing future Special Fraud Alerts developed by the OIG. 

Because each of the previously-developed Special Fraud Alerts contained a similar brief narrative as to the nature
of the OIG and a description of the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, we will first summarize and set out
this material in one section, as it is germane to all 5 subject issuances. Following that will be the main body and content
of each of the Special Fraud Alerts. Lastly, we have provided the general information set forth in each of these Special
Fraud Alerts addressing information on how to report information on suspected violations. 



The OIG Special Fraud Alerts


A. General Background



The Office of Inspector General was established at the Department of Health and Human Services by Congress in 1976
to identify and eliminate fraud, abuse and waste in Health and Human Services programs and to promote efficiency and
economy in departmental operations. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
and inspections. To help reduce fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the OIG is actively investigating violations
of the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b(b).

What Is the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Law?


Among its provisions, the anti-kickback statute penalizes anyone who knowingly and willfully solicits, receives,
offers or pays remuneration in cash or in kind to induce, or in return for: 
A. Referring an individual to a person for the furnishing, or arranging for the furnishing, of any item or service payable
under the Medicare or Medicaid program; or 
B. Purchasing, leasing or ordering , or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering, any goods,
facility, service or item payable under the Medicare or Medicaid program. 
Violators are subject to criminal penalties, or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
or both. In 1987, section 14 of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act, PL 100-93, directed
this Department to promulgate ``safe harbor'' regulations, in order to provide health care providers a mechanism
to assure them that they will not be prosecuted under the anti-kickback statute for engaging in particular practices.
The Department published 11 final ``safe harbor'' regulations on July 29, 1991 (42 CFR 1001.952, 56 FR 35952), and
two more on November 5, 1992 (42 CFR 1001.952, 57 FR 52723). The scope of the anti-kickback statute is not expanded by
the ``safe harbor'' regulations; these regulations give those in good faith compliance with a ``safe harbor'' the
assurance that they will not be prosecuted under the anti-kickback statute. 


B. Special Fraud Alert: Joint Venture Arrangements
(Issued August 1989)


The Office of Inspector General has become aware of a proliferation of arrangements between those in a position to
refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays. Some
examples of the items or services provided in these arrangements include clinical diagnostic laboratory services,
durable medical equipment (DME), and other diagnostic services. Sometimes these deals are called ``joint ventures.''
A joint venture may take a variety of forms: it may be a contractual arrangement between two or more parties to cooperate
in providing services, or it may involve the creation of a new legal entity by the parties, such as a limited partnership
or closely held corporation, to provide such services. Of course, there may be legitimate reasons to form a joint venture,
such as raising necessary investment capital. However, the Office of Inspector General believes that some of these
joint ventures may violate the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute.
Under these suspect joint ventures, physicians may become investors in a newly formed joint venture entity. The investors
refer their patients to this new entity, and are paid by the entity in the form of ``profit distributions.'' These subject
joint ventures may be intended not so much to raise investment capital legitimately to start a business, but to lock
up a stream of referrals from the physician investors and to compensate them indirectly for these referrals. Because
physician investors can benefit financially from their referrals, unnecessary procedures and tests may be ordered
or performed, resulting in unnecessary program expenditures.
The questionable features of these suspect joint ventures may be reflected in three areas: 
(1) The manner in which investors are selected and retained; 
(2) The nature of the business structure of the joint venture; and 
(3) The financing and profit distributions. 


Suspect Joint Ventures: What To Look For 


To help you identify these suspect joint ventures, the following are examples of questionable features, which separately
or taken together may result in a business arrangement that violates the anti-kickback statute. Please note that
this is not intended as an exhaustive list, but rather gives examples of indicators of potentially unlawful activity.



Investor 


 Investors are chosen because they are in a position to make referrals. 
 Physicians who are expected to make a large number of referrals may be offered a greater investment opportunity
in the joint venture than those anticipated to make fewer referrals. 
 Physician investors may be actively encouraged to make referrals to the joint venture, and may be encouraged
to divest their ownership interest if they fail to sustain an ``acceptable'' level of referrals. 
 The joint venture tracks its sources of referrals, and distributes this information to the investors. 
 Investors may be required to divest their ownership interest if they cease to practice in the service area,
for example, if they move, become disabled or retire. 
 Investment interests may be nontransferable. 


Business Structure 


 The structure of some joint ventures may be suspect. For example, one of the parties may be an ongoing entity
already engaged in a particular line of business. That party may act as the reference laboratory or DME supplier for
the joint venture. In some of these cases, the joint venture can be best characterized as a ``shell.'' 
 In the case of a shell laboratory joint venture, for example:




_It conducts very little testing on the premises, even though it is Medicare certified. 
_The reference laboratory may do the vast bulk of the testing at its central processing laboratory, even though it
also serves as the ``manager'' of the shell laboratory. 
_Despite the location of the actual testing, the local ``shell'' laboratory bills Medicare directly for these tests.

<TEXT>
 

 In the case of a shell DME joint venture, for example: 


_It owns very little of the DME or other capital equipment; rather the ongoing entity owns them. 
_The ongoing entity is responsible for all day-to-day operations of the joint venture, such as delivery of the DME
and billing. 


Financing and Profit Distribution 


 The amount of capital invested by the physician may be disproportionately small and the returns on investment
may be disproportionately large when compared to a typical investment in a new business enterprise. 
 Physician investors may invest only a nominal amount, such as $500 to $1500. 
 Physician investors may be permitted to ``borrow'' the amount of the ``investment'' from the entity, and pay
it back through deductions from profit distributions, thus eliminating even the need to contribute cash to the partnership.

 Investors may be paid extraordinary returns on the investment in comparison with the risk involved, often
well over 50 to 100 percent per year. 


C. Special Fraud Alert: Routine Waiver of Copayments or Deductibles Under Medicare Part B 
(Issued May 1991) 


To help reduce fraud in the Medicare program, the Office of Inspector General is actively investigating health care
providers, practitioners and suppliers of health care items and services who (1) are paid on the basis of charges
 and (2) routinely waive (do not bill) Medicare deductible and copayment charges to beneficiaries for items and services
covered by the Medicare program. 




What Are Medicare Deductible and Copayment Charges? 


The Medicare ``deductible'' is the amount that must be paid by a Medicare beneficiary before Medicare will pay for
any items or services for that individual. Currently, the Medicare Part B deductible is $100 per year. 
``Copayment'' (``coinsurance'') is the portion of the cost of an item or service which the Medicare beneficiary must
pay. Currently, the Medicare Part B coinsurance is generally 20 percent of the reasonable charge for the item or service.
Typically, if the Medicare reasonable charge for a Part B item or service is $100, the Medicare beneficiary (who has
met his [or her] deductible) must pay $20 of the physician's bill, and Medicare will pay $80. 


Why Is it Illegal for ``Charged-Based'' Providers, Practitioners and Suppliers to Routinely Waive Medicare Copayment
and Deductibles? 


Routine waiver of deductibles and copayments by charge-based providers, practitioners or suppliers is unlawful
because it results in (1) false claims, (2) violations of the anti-kickback statute, and (3) excessive utilization
of items and services paid for by Medicare. 
A ``charge-based'' provider, practitioner or supplier is one who is paid by Medicare on the basis of the ``reasonable
charge'' for the item or service provided. 42 U.S.C. 1395u(b)(3); 42 CFR 405.501. Medicare typically pays 80 percent
of the reasonable charge. 42 U.S.C. 1395l(a)(1). The criteria for determining what charges are reasonable are contained
in regulations, and include an examination of (1) the actual charge for the item or service, (2) the customary charge
for the item or service, (3) the prevailing charge in the same locality for similar items or services. The Medicare
reasonable charge cannot exceed the actual charge for the item or service, and may generally not exceed the customary
charge or the highest prevailing charge for the item or service. In some cases, the provider, practitioner or supplier
will be paid the lesser of his [or her] actual charge or an amount established by a fee schedule. 
A provider, practitioner or supplier who routinely waives Medicare copayments or deductibles is misstating its
actual charge. For example, if a supplier claims that its charge for a piece of equipment is $100, but routinely waives
the copayment, the actual charge is $80. Medicare should be paying 80 percent of $80 (or $64), rather than 80 percent
of $100 (or $80). As a result of the supplier's misrepresentation, the Medicare program is paying $16 more than it should
for this item. 
In certain cases, a provider, practitioner or supplier who routinely waives Medicare copayments or deductibles
also could be held liable under the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute. 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b). The
statute makes it illegal to offer, pay, solicit or receive anything of value as an inducement to generate business
payable by Medicare or Medicaid. When providers, practitioners or suppliers forgive financial obligations for
reasons other than genuine financial hardship of the particular patient, they may be unlawfully inducing that patient
to purchase items or services from them.

<TEXT>
 

At first glance, it may appear that routine waiver of copayments and deductibles helps Medicare beneficiaries. By
waiving Medicare copayments and deductibles, the provider of services may claim that the beneficiary incurs no costs.
In fact, this is not true. Studies have shown that if patients are required to pay even a small portion of their care,
they will be better health care consumers, and select items or services because they are medically needed, rather
than simply because they are free. Ultimately, if Medicare pays more for an item or service than it should, or if it pays
for unnecessary items or services, there are less Medicare funds available to pay for truly needed services. 
One important exception to the prohibition against waiving copayments and deductibles is that providers, practitioners
or suppliers may forgive the copayment in consideration of a particular patient's financial hardship. This hardship
exception, however, must not be used routinely; it should be used occasionally to address the special financial needs
of a particular patient. Except in such special cases, a good faith effort to collect deductibles and copayments must
be made. Otherwise, claims submitted to Medicare mat violate the statutes discussed above and other provisions of
the law. 


What Penalties Can Someone Be Subject to for Routinely Waiving Medicare Copayments or Deductibles? 


Whoever submits a false claim to the Medicare program (for example, a claim misrepresents an actual charge) may be
subject to criminal, civil or administrative liability for making false statements and/or submitting false claims
to the Government. 18 U.S.C. 287 and 1001; 31 U.S.C. 3729; 42 CFR 1320a-7a). Penalties can include imprisonment,
criminal fines, civil damages and forfeitures, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from Medicare and the State
health care programs. 
In addition, anyone who routinely waives copayments or deductibles can be criminally prosecuted under 42 U.S.C.
1320a-7b(b), and excluded from participating in Medicare and the State health care programs under the anti-kickback
statute. 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)(7). 
Finally, anyone who furnishes items or services to patient substantially in excess of the needs of such patients can
be excluded from Medicare and the State health care programs. 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)(6)(B). 


Indications of Improper Waiver of Deductibles and Copayments 


To help you identify charge-based providers, practitioners or suppliers who routinely waive Medicare deductibles
and copayments, listed below are some suspect marketing practices. Please note that this list is not intended to be
exhaustive but, rather, to highlight some indicators of potentially unlawful activity. 
 Advertisements which state: ``Medicare Accepted As Payment in Full,'' ``Insurance Accepted As Payment in
Full,'' or ``No Out-Of-Pocket Expense.'' 
 Advertisements which promise that ``discounts'' will be given to Medicare beneficiaries. 
 Routine use of ``Financial hardship'' forms which state that the beneficiary is unable to pay the coinsurance/deductible
(i.e., there is no good faith attempt to determine the beneficiary's actual financial condition). 
 Collection of copayments and deductibles only where the beneficiary has Medicare supplemental insurance
(``Medigap'') coverage (i.e., the items or services are ``free'' to the beneficiary). 
 Charges to Medicare beneficiaries which are higher than those made to other persons for similar services and
items (the higher charges offset the waiver of coinsurance.)

<TEXT>
 

 Failure to collect copayments or deductibles for a specific group of Medicare patients for reasons unrelated
to indigency (e.g., a supplier waives coinsurance or deductible for all patients from a particular hospital, in order
to get referrals). 
 ``Insurance programs'' which cover copayments or deductibles only for items or services provided by the entity
offering the insurance. The ``insurance premium'' paid by the beneficiary is insignificant and can be as low as $1
a month or even $1 a year. These premiums are not based upon actuarial risks, but instead are a sham used to disguise the
routine waiver of copayments and deductibles. 


D. Special Fraud Alert: Hospital Incentives to Physicians 
(Issued May 1992) 


Why Do Hospitals Provide Economic Incentives to Physicians? 


As many hospitals have become more aggressive in their attempts to recruit and retain physicians and increase patient
referrals, physician incentives (sometimes referred to as ``practice enhancements'') are becoming increasingly
common. Some physicians actively solicit such incentives. These incentives may result in reductions in the physician's
professional expenses or an increase in his or her revenues. In exchange, the physician is aware that he or she is often
expected to refer the majority, if not all, of his or her patients to the hospital providing the incentives. 


Why Is it Illegal for Hospitals to Provide Financial Incentives to Physicians for Their Referrals? 


The Office of Inspector General has become aware of a variety of hospital incentive programs used to compensate physicians
(directly or indirectly) for referring patients to the hospital. These arrangements are implicated by the anti-kickback
statute because they can constitute remuneration offered to induce, or in return for, the referral of business paid
for by Medicare or Medicaid. In addition, they are not protected under the existing ``safe harbor'' regulations.

These incentive programs can interfere with the physician's judgment of what is the most appropriate care for a patient.
They can inflate costs to the Medicare program by causing physicians to overuse inappropriately the services of a
particular hospital. The incentives may result in the delivery of inappropriate care to Medicare beneficiaries
and Medicaid recipients by inducing the physician to refer patients to the hospital providing financial incentives
rather than to another hospital (or non-acute care facility) offering the best or most appropriate care for that patient.



Suspect Hospital Incentive Arrangements_What To Look For 


To help identify suspect incentive arrangements, examples of practices which are often questionable are listed
[below]. Please note that this list is not intended to be exhaustive but, rather, to suggest some indicators of potentially
unlawful activity. 
 Payment of any sort of incentive by the hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital. 
 The use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment (in facilities usually located close
to the hospital). 
 Provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff services. 
 Free training for a physician's office staff in such areas as management techniques, CPT coding and laboratory
techniques. 
 Guarantees which provide that, if the physician's income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital
will supplement the remainder up to a certain amount. 
 Low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be ``forgiven'' if a physician refers patients (or
some number of patients) to the hospital. 
 Payment of the cost of a physician's travel and expenses for conferences. 
 Payment for a physician's continuing education courses. 
 Coverage on hospitals' group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician. 
 Payment for services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive
duties by the physician, or payment for services in excess of the fair market value of services rendered.

Financial incentive packages which incorporate these or similar features may be subject to prosecution under the
Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, if one of the purposes of the incentive is to influence the physician's
medical decision as to where to refer his or her patients for treatment. 


E. Special Fraud Alert: Prescription Drug Marketing Schemes 
(Issued August 1994) 


How Does the Anti-Kickback Law Relate to Prescription Drug Marketing Schemes? 


In recent years, prescription drug companies in the United States have increased their marketing activities among
providers, patients and suppliers such as pharmacies. Many prescription drug marketing activities go far beyond
traditional advertising and educational contacts. Physicians, suppliers and, increasingly, patients are being
offered valuable, non-medical benefits in exchange for selecting specific prescription drug brands. Traditionally,
physicians and pharmacists have been trusted to provide treatments and recommend products in the best interest of
the patient. In an era of aggressive drug marketing, however, patients may now be using prescription drug items, unaware
that their physician or pharmacist is being compensated for promoting the selection of a specific product. Prescription
drugs supplied under one of these programs are often reimbursed under Medicaid. Among the specific activities, which
the OIG has identified, are the following actual cases: 
 A ``product conversion'' program which resulted in 96,000 brand-name conversions. In this scenario, for
instance, Drug Company A offered a cash award to pharmacies for each time a drug prescription was changed from Drug
Company B's product to Drug Company A's product. The pharmacies were induced to help persuade physicians, who were
unaware of the pharmacies' financial interest, to change prescription. 
 A ``frequent flier'' campaign in which physicians were given credit toward airline frequent flier mileage
each time the physician completed a questionnaire for a new patient placed on the drug company's product. 
 A ``research grant'' program in which physicians were given substantial payments for de minimis recordkeeping
tasks. The physician administered the drug manufacturer's product to the patient and made brief notes, sometimes
a single word, about the treatment outcome. Upon completion of a limited number of such ``studies,'' the physician
received payment from the manufacturer. 
If one purpose of any of these marketing schemes is to induce the provision of a prescription drug item reimbursable
by Medicaid, then the criminal anti-kickback statute is implicated. There is no statutory exception or ``safe harbor''
to protect such activities. Thus a physician, pharmacy or other practitioner or supplier receiving payment under
these activities may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.

<PARENT> FR941219-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A marketing program that is illegal under the anti-kickback statute may pose a danger to patients because the offering
or payment of remuneration may interfere with a physician's judgment in determining the most appropriate treatment
for a patient. Further, where the patient is a Medicaid beneficiary, these drug marketing practices may increase
the Federal government's costs of reimbursing suppliers for the products. The OIG is investigating various drug
marketing schemes, and enforcing the anti-kickback laws where these practices affect the Federal health care programs.


What To Look For


Generally, a payment or gift may be considered improper under 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b) if it is:
 Made to a person in a position to generate business for the paying party;
 Related to the volume of business generated; and
 More than nominal in value and/or exceeds fair market value of any legitimate service rendered to the payer,
or is unrelated to any service at all other than referral of patients.
OIG investigation may be warranted where one or more of the following features is present in prescription drug marketing
activities:
 Any prize, gift or cash payment, coupon or bonus (e.g., airline discounts and related travel premiums), offered
to physicians and/or suppliers (including pharmacies, mail order prescription drug companies and managed care
organizations) in exchange for, or based on, prescribing or providing specific prescription products. These items
are particularly suspect if based on value or volume of business generated for the drug company.
 Materials which offer cash or other benefits to pharmacists (or others in a position to recommend prescription
drug products) in exchange for performing marketing tasks in the course of pharmacy practice related to Medicare
or Medicaid. The marketing tasks may include sales-oriented ``educational'' or ``counseling'' contacts, or physician
and/or patient outreach, etc.
 Grants to physicians and clinicians for studies of prescription products when the studies are of questionable
scientific value and require little or no actual scientific pursuit. The grants may nonetheless offer substantial
benefits based on, or related to, use of the product.
 Any payment, including cash or other benefit, given to a patient, provider or supplier for changing a prescription,
or recommending or requesting such a change, from one product to another, unless the payment is made fully consistent
with a ``safe harbor'' regulation, 42 CFR 1001.952, or other Federal provision governing the reporting of prescription
drug prices.

F. Special Fraud Alert: Arrangements for the Provision of Clinical Lab Services
(Issued October 1994)


How Does the Anti-Kickback Statute Relate to Arrangements for the Provision of Clinical Lab Services?


Many physicians and other health care providers rely on the services of outside clinical laboratories to which they
may refer high volumes of patient specimens every day. The quality, timeliness and cost of these services are of obvious
concern to Medicare and Medicaid patients and to the programs that finance their health care services. Since the physician,
not the patient, generally selects the clinical laboratory, it is essential that the physician's decision regarding
where to refer specimens is based only on the best interests of the patient.
Whenever a laboratory offers or gives to a source of referrals anything of value not paid for at fair market value, the
inference may be made that the thing of value is offered to induce the referral of business. The same is true whenever
a referral source solicits or receives anything of value from the laboratory. By ``fair market value'' we mean value
for general commercial purposes. However, ``fair market value'' must reflect an arms length transaction which has
not been adjusted to include the additional value which one or both of the parties has attributed to the referral of
business between them.
The office of Inspector General has become aware of a number of practices engaged in by clinical laboratories and health
care providers that implicate the anti-kickback statute in this manner. Below are some examples of lab services arrangements
that may violate the anti-kickback statute.


Provision of Phlebotomy Services to Physicians


When permitted by State law, a laboratory may make available to a physician's office a phlebotomist who collects specimens
from patients for testing by the outside laboratory. While the mere placement of a laboratory employee in the physician's
office would not necessarily serve as an inducement prohibited by the anti-kickback statute, the statute is implicated
when the phlebotomist performs additional tasks that are normally the responsibility of the physician's office
staff. These tasks can include taking vital signs or other nursing functions, testing for the physician's office
laboratory, or performing clerical services.
Where the phlebotomist performs clerical or medical functions not directly related to the collection or processing
of laboratory specimens, a strong inference arises that he or she is providing a benefit in return for the physician's
referrals to the laboratory. In such a case, the physician, the phlebotomist, and the laboratory may have exposure
under the anti-kickback statute. This analysis applies equally to the placement of phlebotomists in other health
care settings, including nursing homes, clinics and hospitals.
Furthermore, the mere existence of a contract between the laboratory and the health care provider that prohibits
the phlebotomist from performing services unrelated to specimen collection does not eliminate the OIG's concern,
where the phlebotomist is not closely monitored by his [of her] employer or where the contractual prohibition is not
rigorously enforced.


Lab Pricing at Renal Dialysis Centers


The Medicare program pays for laboratory tests provided to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) in two different
ways. Some laboratory testing is considered routine and payment is included in the composite rate paid by Medicare
to the ESRD facility which in turn pays the laboratory. Some laboratory testing required by the patient is not included
in the composite rate, and these additional tests are billed by the laboratory directly to Medicare and paid at the
usual laboratory fee schedule price.
The OIG is aware of cases where a laboratory offers to perform the tests encompassed by the composite rate at a price
below fair market value of the tests performed. In order to offset the low charges on the composite rate tests, the ESRD
facility agrees to refer all or most of its non-composite rate tests to the laboratory. This arrangement appears to
be an offer of something of value (composite rate tests below fair market value) in return for the ordering of additional
tests which are billed directly to the Medicare program.
If offered or accepted in return for referral of additional business, the lab's pricing scheme is illegal remuneration
under the anti-kickback statute. The statutory exception and ``safe harbor'' for ``discounts'' does not apply to
immunize parties to this type of transaction, since discounts on the composite rate tests are offered to induce referral
of 

other 

tests. See 42 CFR 1001.952(h)(3)(ii).


Waiver of Charges To Managed Care Patients


Managed care plans may require a physician or other health care provider to use only the laboratory with which the plan
has negotiated a fee schedule. In such situations, the plan usually will refuse to pay claims submitted by other laboratories.
The provider, however, may use a different laboratory and may wish to continue to use that laboratory for non-managed
care patients. In order to retain the provider as a client, the laboratory that does not have the managed care contract
may agree to perform the managed care work free of charge.
The status of such agreements under the anti-kickback statute depends in part on the nature of the contractual relationship
between the managed care plan and its providers. Under the terms of many managed care contracts, a provider receives
a bonus or other payment if utilization of ancillary services, such as laboratory testing, is kept below a particular
level. Other managed care plans impose financial penalties if the provider's utilization of services exceeds pre-established
levels. When the laboratory agrees to write off charges for the physician's managed care work, the physician may realize
a financial benefit from the managed care plan created by the appearance that utilization of tests has been reduced.

<DOCNO> FR941219-2-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941219-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In cases where the provision of free services results in a benefit to the provider, the anti-kickback statute is implicated.
If offered or accepted in return for the referral of Medicare or State health care plan business, both the laboratory
and the physician may be violating the anti-kickback statute. There is no statutory exception or ``safe harbor''
to immunize any party to such a practice because the Federal programs do not realize the benefit of these ``free'' services.
See 42 CFR 1001.952(h)(3)(iii).


Other Inducements


The following are additional examples of inducements offered by clinical laboratories which may implicate the anti-kickback
statute:
 Free pick-up and disposal of bio-hazardous waste products (such as sharps) unrelated to the collection of
specimens for the outside laboratory.
 Provision of computers or fax machines, unless such equipment is integral to, and exclusively used for, performance
of the outside laboratory's work.
 Provision of free laboratory testing for health care providers, their families and their employees.
When one purpose of these arrangements is to induce the referral of program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both
the clinical laboratory and the health care provider may be liable under the statute and may be subject to criminal
prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Section 4(e) Conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric Project, Montana



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of Public Comment Period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60158), the Department of the Interior published a notice of availability and a request
for comment regarding its proposed Section 4(e) conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric Project license. In an effort
to allow more time for public participation the Department is extending the comment period for an additional 45 days.
Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 797(e), the proposed conditions provide for the adequate protection
and utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation and the Fish and Wildlife Service administered Flathead Waterfowl
Production Area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60158) notice of availability and request for comment provided a 30 day period during which
the Department would receive comments regarding its proposed Section 4(e) conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric
Project. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 797(e), the proposed conditions provide for the adequate protection
and utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation and the Fish and Wildlife Service administered Flathead Waterfowl
Production Area. The proposed conditions for the Flathead Indian Reservation provide for the imposition of a base
load operational scenario at the Kerr Project. This operational scenario precludes the use of Kerr Dam as a load regulating
or peak power generation facility, and requires minimum flows, certain restrictions on flow fluctuations (ramping
rates), and a two year ramping rate study. In addition, the proposed conditions provide for non-operational measures
designed to protect and provide for adequate utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation in conjunction with
operational measures. The non-operational measures include the development of a Fish and Wildlife Implementation
Strategy, development of an operational rule curve, habitat acquisition, habitat development, fishery supplementation
and reintroduction, development of recreational resources, and the identification and protection of cultural
resources on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The proposed conditions for the Flathead WPA provide for the imposition
of erosion control on the north shore of Flathead Lake and the upper Flathead River, island restoration, and habitat
acquisition and development. The costs of all measures will be borne by the project licensees.



The deadline for comment on the proposed Section 4(e) conditions is extended for 45 days by this notice. The comment
period, which began on November 22, 1994, therefore, consists of a total of 75 days. All comments are due to the Department
on or before February 6, 1995. In addition, the Department will be making available two technical reports that further
support the proposed Section 4(e) conditions, the ``Kerr Hydro-electric Project Report'' by Stetson Engineers,
Inc., and ``An Evaluation of the Wildlife Components of the Kerr Dam Project Mitigation and Management Plan and Recommended
Section 4(e) Articles'' by BioSystems Analysis, Inc. The proposed conditions and the above referenced reports are
available for review and copying at the Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC in room 6443.
Copies of the proposed Section 4(e) conditions and the above referenced reports will be made available to all interested
parties upon request.

<DOCTITLE>Central Utah Project Completion Act; Notice of Intent To Contract for Hydroelectric Power Development in the Diamond
Fork Area of the Central Utah Project (CUP) and the Strawberry Valley Project (SVP), UT</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, Department of the Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to accept proposals, select a lessee, and contract for hydroelectric power development in the Diamond
Fork area.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Current Federal policy encourages non-Federal development of electrical power resource potential on Federal water
resource projects. The Department of the Interior (Interior), in consultation with the Department of Energy, Western
Area Power Administration (Western), will consider proposals for non-Federal development of hydroelectric power
in the Diamond Fork area of the CUP and the SVP, Utah, consisting of the area from the outlet of the Syar Tunnel to the confluence
of Diamond Fork Creek and the Spanish Fork River. Interior is considering such hydroelectric power development under
a lease of power privilege. No Federal funds will be available for such hydroelectric power development. Western
would have the first opportunity to purchase and/or market the power that would be generated by such development under
a lease of power privilege. The CUP and the SVP are Federal Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) projects. This notice
presents background information, proposal content guidelines, information concerning selection of a non-Federal
entity(s) to develop hydroelectric power in the Diamond Fork area of the CUP and the SVP, and power purchasing and/or
marketing considerations. Interested parties are invited to submit proposals.

All Project study and development costs, including compliance with Federal fish, wildlife, recreation and environmental
laws, would be the expense of the lessee(s). Lease payments to the United States will be deposited in the Upper Colorado
River Basin Fund.


Proposal Content Guidelines


Interested parties should submit proposals explaining in as precise detail as is practicable how the Project would
be developed. Factors which a proposal(s) should consider and address include, but are not limited to, the following:
A. Provide qualifications of the proposing entity(s). Include information on preference status, type of organization,
length of time in business, experience in funding and design and construction of similar projects, industry rating(s)
that indicate financial soundness of the potential lessee(s), experience of key management personnel, history
of any reorganizations or mergers with other companies, and any other information that demonstrates the adequacy
of the proposal and financial ability to fund all studies, designs, and construction. The term ``preference,'' as
applied to a lease of power privilege, means an entity qualifying for preference to develop non-Federal hydroelectric
power, under Section 9(c) of the 1939 Act, as a municipality, public corporation or agency, or cooperative or other
nonprofit organization financed in whole or in part by loans made pursuant to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.
B. Provide geographical locations and describe principal structures and other important features of the Project
including roads and transmission lines. Estimate and describe installed capacity and the capacity of the power facilities
under dry, average, and wet hydrological conditions. Also describe seasonal or annual generation patterns. Include
estimates of the amount of electrical energy that would be produced from each facility for each month of average, dry,
and wet water years. If capacity and energy can be delivered to another location, either by the proposing entity or
by potential wheeling agents, specify where capacity and energy can be delivered. Include concepts for power sales
and contractual arrangements, involved parties and the proposed approach to wheeling if required.
C. Indicate title arrangements and the ability for acquiring title to or the right to occupy and use lands necessary
for the Project, including such additional lands as may be required during construction.
D. Identify water rights applicable to the proper operation of the Project, the holder of such rights, and how these
rights would be acquired or perfected.
E. Explain studies necessary to adequately define impacts on the CUP and the SVP and the environment in order to facilitate
the decision making process. Explain any proposed use of the Project for conservation and utilization of the available
water resources in the public interest. Describe any significant environmental issues and the approach for gathering
data and handling the environmental issues to protect and enhance the quality of the environment.
F. Describe anticipated contractual arrangements with the District and the Association and define how the Project
would operate in harmony with the CUP and the SVP.
G. Provide a management plan to accomplish such activities as planning, NEPA compliance, design, construction,
operation, and maintenance. Prepare schedules of these activities as is applicable. Describe what studies are necessary
to accomplish the hydroelectric power development and how the studies would be implemented.
H. Estimate Project development cost. This cost should include all investment costs such as the cost of studies to
determine feasibility, NEPA compliance, design, construction, and financing as well as the amortized annual cost
of the investment; also, the annual operation, maintenance, and replacement expense for the Project and other expenses
associated with the CUP and the SVP. If there are additional transmission or wheeling expenses associated with the
development of the Project, these should be included. Identify proposed methods of financing the Project. An economic
analysis should be presented that compares the present worth of all benefits and costs of the Project. Additionally,
a financial analysis should be presented that compares monies available to the United States for use of Federal facilities
and costs to the CUP and the SVP.


Selection of Lessee


Interior, in consultation with Western, will evaluate proposals received in response to this published notice.
A proposal will be ruled unacceptable if it is not complete, is not consistent with both CUP and SVP purposes, and does
not accommodate pre-existing legal rights of the District and the Association, as determined by Interior.
Selection of a lessee will be based on the following considerations:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941219-2-00089 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941219-2-00053 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A. First consideration will be given to preference entities. Interior will give added consideration to proposals
that (1) are especially well-adapted to developing, conserving, and utilizing the water and natural resources;
(2) are harmonious with CUP and SVP purposes; and (3) would provide significant economic benefits to the CUP, the SVP,
and the United States. 

B. Second consideration will be given to non-preference entities. Interior will give added consideration to proposals
that (1) are especially well-adapted to developing, conserving, and utilizing the water and natural resources;
(2) are harmonious with CUP and SVP purposes; and (3) would provide significant economic benefits to the CUP, the SVP,
and the United States. 



Power Purchasing and/or Marketing Considerations



Western would have the first opportunity to purchase and/or market the power that would be generated by the Project
under a lease(s) of power privilege. Western will consult with Interior on such power purchasing and/or marketing
considerations. 

Western would determine its interest in purchasing the electric power from the lessee(s) as a replacement resource
for its Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects (SLCA/IP) under principles and processes being considered as part
of Western's Replacement Power Process under the Grand Canyon Protection Act. Western would also apply Integrated
Resource Planning principles in comparing this resource with all other potential resource purchases available
to Western. 

Alternatively, Western may market the power available from the Project on a stand-alone basis, first to preference
entities qualified under criteria established by Western and second to non-preference entities, by developing
an individual marketing plan for this power. This marketing plan would be developed through a separate subsequent
public process beginning with a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of Western's intent to market the power. The marketing plan would include all aspects of marketing the power, including
assignment of power to qualified preference and/or non-preference entities, pricing, transmission, and delivery
of power. Western would recover the costs it would incur in purchasing and/or marketing the power through the rates
charged for the power. Firm power rates would be established through a public process, initiated by a notice in the


Federal Register

, separate from the marketing plan. 

In the event Western elects to not purchase and/or market the power generated by the Project or such a decision cannot
be made prior to execution of the lease of power privilege, the lessee(s) would be responsible for marketing the power
generated by the Project with priority given to preference entities as heretofore defined in PROPOSAL CONTENT GUIDELINES,
paragraph A. 



Notification of Selection of Lessee and Negotiations for a Lease of Power Privilege



After Interior selects a lessee, Interior will notify, in writing, all entities submitting proposals of Interior's
decision regarding selection of the potential lessee(s). The selected potential lessee(s) will have five years
from the date of such notification to enter into a lease(s) of power privilege for the site or sites identified in the
proposal. Lease of power privilege negotiation sessions will be public. If Western elects to purchase and/or market
the power, such lease(s) of power privilege will state how Western will be involved in purchasing and/or marketing
the power. 

Any excessive delay resulting from compliance with the provisions of Federal environmental laws or administrative
review by a Federal agency, pertaining to the Project, may extend the five year time period for a period equal to that
of the delay. In the event of litigation related to the proposed Project, the five year time period will be extended
for a period equal to that of the delay, provided such litigation was initiated by parties other than the selected potential
lessee(s) or its employees, officers, agents, assigns, shareholders, customers or persons or groups served by or
in privity with the potential lessee(s).

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice makes available to the public a summary of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the final Master Plan/FEIS for
the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge, located in Orleans Parish, Louisiana. Establishment of a 19,000-acre
refuge was authorized by Congress on July 28, 1986. As of 1993, the refuge contained approximately 22,800 acres under
the supervision of the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). There is a potential for future expansion of the refuge
to include a total of approximately 30,000 acres. Federal funding for design, construction, and operation of the
refuge is provided through appropriations by Congress. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (40 CFR 1505.2), the Service issues this ROD upon consideration
of the FEIS prepared for the Proposed Action.



A Notice of Availability of the FEIS was published by the Environmental Protection Agency in the 

Federal Register

 on September 9, 1994.

Factors influencing selection of the Preferred Alternative included: (1) Compliance with the purpose for which
the Refuge was established, (2) adherence to the goals, objectives, and policies established for the refuge, (3)
opinions of the public and commenting agencies, and (4) evaluation of the impacts of the four alternatives on the physical,
biological, and socioeconomic environments. The Preferred Alternative, referred to as Alternative 2, Comprehensive

These alternatives were developed by the Service with input obtained from the public and review agencies during the
review and comment process. Issues raised in comments included, but are not limited to: Expansion of the refuge, hunting,
trapping, commercial fishing, public access, locations of visitor center, habitat management objectives, mosquito
control, and monitoring of management programs to achieve program objectives. All substantive issues raised during
the public and agency review process have been addressed to the satisfaction of the Service either through revisions
incorporated into the FEIS text or in responses contained in Section 9.0 of the FEIS. These responses are incorporated
by reference into the ROD. One comment was received on the FEIS.
Findings and Decision: Based upon a thorough analysis and consideration of the impacts identified in the FEIS, results
of the research and investigations conducted in conjunction with the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS)
and FEIS, comments received in connection with the public information hearings and review of the DEIS, public review
of management programs already approved for the refuge, and other relevant factors, including the purposes for which
the refuge was established by Congress and statutory and regulatory guidance for funding such projects, the Service
finds as follows:
(1) The preferred alternative is Alternative 2. Alternative 2 consists of the Management and Facilities Programs
discussed previously.
(2) The Preferred Alternative best fulfills the Public Use Goal for environmental education, wildlife and habitat
interpretation, wildlife/wildlands-oriented recreation, and scientific research.
(3) Consistent with economic, social, and other essential considerations, to the maximum extent practicable, potential
adverse environmental effects identified in the FEIS will be minimized or avoided by incorporating mitigative measures
as conditions of Federal funding approval and permit issuance. The potential impacts and mitigative measures are
described in Section 4.0 and 5.0 of the FEIS.
(4) Only 45 acres of jurisdictional wetlands, out of the presently supervised area of approximately 22,800 acres,
are estimated to be impacted by construction of facilities on the refuge. Specific details regarding mitigation
plans for site-specific projects will be developed on a case-by-case basis as part of the Section 404 permit process.
However, under the Preferred Alternative, habitat management measures implemented on other areas of the refuge
for the purpose of increasing the quality and quantity of emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation and scrub/shrub
vegetation are expected to be more than adequate to serve as mitigation for wetlands impacted by facility construction.
(5) The Preferred Alternative is designed to conserve and/or enhance existing habitat for the presently listed threatened
and endangered species using the refuge. No State or federally listed endangered or threatened species or their critical
habitats are known to be adversely affected by implementation of the Preferred Alternative.
(6) No historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places are know to
be adversely affected by implementation of the Preferred Alternative. Detailed cultural resources investigations
will be conducted for site-specific projects on a case-by-case basis as part of the Section 404 permit process.
(7) Statutory authority for the Service to fund and implement, and for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to permit, the
Preferred Alternative exists.
(8) The requirements of NEPA and the implementing regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) have been satisfied.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental
Take Permit for the Proposed Great Hills Reserve Subdivision Development, Austin, Travis County, TX</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agencyy: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

Americo Financial, Limited (Applicant) has applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental
take permit pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned
Permit Number PRT-782832. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 10 years, would authorize
the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia). The proposed take would
occur as a result of the construction and operation of a residential development on 294.15 acres, in two parcels, in
Austin, Travis County, Texas.



The Service has prepared an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take
application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made
before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the
Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``taking'' of endangered species such as the golden-cheeked warbler. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species incidental to,
and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at
50 CFR 17.22.



The Applicant plans to build a residential subdivision in northwest Austin, Travis County, Texas. An EA/HCP has been
developed as mitigation of the incidental taking of the golden-cheeked warbler. The Applicant proposes to mitigate
the incidental take via dedicating approximately 440 acres of occupied golden-cheeked warbler habitat as a permanent
preserve, providing funding for the operation and management of the preserve lands, performing golden-cheeked
warbler studies on the project lands, and avoiding construction activities within warbler territories during the
breeding season. Details of the mitigation are provided in the EA/HCP for the Great Hills Reserve.

The Applicant considered five alternatives but rejected four because they were not economically viable.

 National Park Service, U.S. Dept. of the Interior.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of FY-1995 Grant Round_UPARR Rehabilitation and Innovation Grants. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of grant funds under the Rehabilitation and Innovation phases of the Urban
Park and Recreation Recovery (UPARR) Program and provides information on the application process including eligible
recipients and deadlines for submission of proposals.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 For Fiscal Year 1995, $7,486,000 is available for the funding of Rehabilitation and Innovation projects under the
Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-625). NPS will consider proposals for funding projects
with a dollar limit of $200,000 (Federal share of total project cost) under the Rehabilitation phase of the program
and projects with a dollar limit of $50,000 (Federal share) under the Innovation phase. No more than ten percent ($748,600)
of the total amount appropriated will go toward the funding of Innovation proposals. Preapplications must be received
by the appropriate NPS Regional Office by no later than April 17, 1995. 



Rehabilitation grants will be targeted to rehabilitate existing neighborhood recreation areas and facilities
which have deteriorated to the point where health and safety are endangered or the community's range of quality recreation
service is impaired. Proposals must be designed to provide recreation services for residents within a specified
area identified by the applicant. Proposals may identify improvements at multiple sites or facilities, each of which
must be individually addressed. Grants may be used to remodel, rebuild, expand, or develop existing outdoor or indoor
recreation areas and facilities. 

Innovation grants may generally cover the costs of personnel, training, facilities, recreation equipment, supplies
or services associated with the development of cost-effective ideas, concepts, and approaches towards improving
facility design, operations, or programming for the delivery of recreation services. 

Innovation projects should contribute to a systems approach to recreation by linking recreation services with other
critical community programs such as housing, transportation, health and public safety, water quality, energy conservation,
crime prevention, etc. The project should demonstrate a concept that is untried, unique, and/or advances the state
of the art for recreation at the national, regional or local level. Interested jurisdictions are directed to 36 CFR
72.45 for more detailed discussion of fundable elements under the Innovation phase of the UPARR program. 

In response to widespread interest in programs that help prevent urban crime, 1995 grant awards will focus on, but
not be limited to, youth-at-risk approaches_for example, innovation programs that combine recreation with education,
counselling or mentoring activities aimed at teens and/or rehabilitation proposals that target facilities that
will supply key recreation opportunities for the target youth populations. Program participants may be aware that
a new category of UPARR grants, called ``At-Risk-Youth'' grants, was established as part of the 1994 Omnibus Crime
Bill. However, funding is not authorized for such grants before 1996. Consequently, the 1995 grant round will highlight
crime prevention in recreation programs, without being limited exclusively to such grants. Preparations are now
underway for administration of the new UPARR grants authorized in the Crime Bill should funding for these become available
in 1996 or subsequent years. 



Eligible Jurisdictions:

 Urban jurisdictions as listed in 36 CFR part 72 appendix B will be eligible. Additional jurisdictions meeting the
criteria for eligibility described in 36 CFR part 72 appendix A, and having been approved as discretionary applicants
by NPS, may also compete. All applicants must have a Recovery Action Program (RAP) which has been approved by NPS within
the past five years, and all projects must be in accord with the priorities outlined in the approved RAPs. 



Grant Implementation and Timing:

 Grantees must comply with all applicable Federal laws and regulations for the UPARR program, which include completion
of a final grant agreement within 120 days of a grant offer (based on NPS evaluation of preapplications submitted for
consideration). 



Preapplication Requirements:

 Local chief elected officials (mayors, etc.) applying for UPARR grants will be required to certify, in the preapplication,
that the grantee will comply with all requirements of the UPARR program. Applicants must also identify the type of
control they have over properties to be assisted. Additional requirements are outlined in the UPARR PREAPPLICATION
HANDBOOK (updated for 1995) available from the Regional Offices of NPS. 



Matching Requirements: 

UPARR Rehabilitation and Innovation grants are awarded on a 70/30 (Federal/local) matching basis. As an incentive
for state involvement in the program, the Federal Government will match, dollar for dollar, state contributions
to the local share of the total project cost, up to 15 percent of the approved grant. The Federal share is limited to no
more than 85 percent of the approved grant cost and the overall dollar limitations established above for Rehabilitation
and Innovation grants, respectively. 



Pass-Through Funding: 

At the discretion of the applicant jurisdiction, grants may be transferred, in whole or in part, to independent general
or special purpose local governments, private nonprofit agencies or community groups, and county or regional park
authorities that provide recreation opportunities to the general population within the jurisdictional boundaries
of the applicant jurisdiction. In such situations, the applicant jurisdiction will bear full legal responsibility
and liability for passed-through funds. 



Post-Completion Requirements: 

In accordance with Section 1010 of the UPARR Act of 1978, assisted properties may not be converted to other than public
recreation use without the prior approval of NPS and the replacement of the converted site or facility with one of reasonably
equivalent usefulness and location. This provision may not be applicable to funded Innovation projects depending
upon the nature of the assistance provided.

<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
of 1980, as Amended</DOCTITLE>


In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 C.F.R. 50.7 and pursuant to Section 122 of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9622, notice is hereby given that a proposed Consent
Decree in 

United States

 v. 

Reeves Southeastern Corporation,

 Civil Action No. 94-1752-CIV-T-24A, was lodged on November 2, 1994, with the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division.
This case concerns the Reeves Southeastern Galvanizing (``SEG'') facility and the Reeves Southeastern Wire (``SEW'')
facility which are located along the north and south sides of State Road 574 in Tampa, and, together are known as the
Reeves Southeastern Corporation Superfund Site (the ``Site''). Pursuant to Sections 106 and 107 of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607, the Complaint in
this action seeks recovery of all past and future costs incurred and to be incurred by the United States at the Site,
and injunctive relief for the Site, namely, implementation of remedies selected by EPA in Records of Decision (``ROD'')
for Operable Unit (``OU'') One, dated October 13, 1992, for OU two, dated September 9, 1993, and for OU three dated June
28, 1994. The ROD for OU One provides for excavation of contaminated soils and sediments at the SEW and SEG facilities,
backfilling of those excavated areas with clean fill, solidification and stabilization of contaminated soils and
sediments, disposal of the solidified material above the water table on the SEG facility and installation of a low
permeability cap over the solidified material. The ROD for OU Two requires that the surficial aquifer be monitored
for at least 21/2 years after the source control measures required in the Operable Unit One ROD have been completed.
If, after 21/2 years have expired, levels of contaminants of concern in the surficial aquifer have not been reduced
to a pre-determined targeted level, the surficial aquifer will have to be actively remediated through a pump and treat
system. If levels have attenuated to the target level, pump and treat will not be required at that time; however, monitoring
will continue. The ROD for OU Three requires sampling and monitoring of the North Wetland.
Defendant Reeves (the ``Settling Defendant'') has agreed in the proposed Consent Decree to pay the United States
$297,759 for past response costs incurred at the Site, as well as all future costs of overseeing the implementation
of the Remedial Actions of OU One, Two and Three. The Settling Defendant has also agreed to implement the remedy selected
by EPA for the Site.
The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed Consent Decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment
and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530, and should refer to 

United States

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Labor (DOL) is publishing, for public 
information, a list of the following health care facilities that have submitted attestations (Form ETA 9029 and explanatory
statements) to one of four Regional Offices of DOL (Boston, Chicago, Dallas and Seattle) for the purpose of employing
nonimmigrant alien nurses. A decision has been made on these organizations' attestations and they are on file with
DOL.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that a health care facility seeking to use nonimmigrant aliens as registered
nurses first attest to the Department of Labor (DOL) that it is taking significant steps to develop, recruit and retain
United States (U.S.) workers in the nursing profession. The law also requires that these foreign nurses will not adversely
affect U.S. nurses and that the foreign nurses will be treated fairly. The facility's attestation must be on file with
DOL before the Immigration and Naturalization Service will consider the facility's H-1A visa petitions for
bringing nonimmigrant registered nurses to the United States. 26 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1181(m). The
regulations implementing the nursing attestation program are at 20 CFR Parts 655, Subpart D, and 29 CFR Part 504, (January
6, 1994). The Employment and Training Administration, pursuant to 20 CFR 655.310(c), is publishing the following
list of facilities which have submitted attestations which have been accepted for filing and those which have been
rejected. 



The list of facilities is published so that U.S. registered nurses, and other persons and organizations can be aware
of health care facilities that have requested foreign nurses for their staff. If U.S. registered nurses or other persons
wish to examine the attestation (on Form ETA 9029) and the supporting documentation, the facility is required to make
the attestation and documentation available. Telephone numbers of the facilities chief executive officer also
are listed to aid public inquiries. In addition, attestations and explanatory statements (but not the full supporting
documentation) are available for inspection at the address for the Employment and Training Administration set forth

to the Secretary of Labor. Therefore, these notices of proposed exemption are issued solely by the Department. 


The applications contain representations with regard to the proposed exemptions which are summarized below. Interested
persons are referred to the applications on file with the Department for a complete statement of the facts and representations.




Alucobond Technologies, Incorporated Employees' Savings Plan (the Plan) Located in St. Louis, Missouri; Proposed
Exemption


[Application No. D-9834]


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through

Incorporated (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, and (2) the Plan's potential repayment
of the Loan upon the receipt by the Plan of payments under Guaranteed Investment Contract No. CG01285A3A (the GIC)
issued by Executive Life Insurance Company (Executive Life); provided the following conditions are satisfied:

(A) No interest or expenses are paid by the Plan in connection with the proposed transaction; 
(B) The Loan will be repaid only out of amounts paid to the Plan by Executive Life, its successors, or any other responsible
third party; and

(C) Repayment of the Loan is waived with respect to the amount by which the Loan exceeds GIC proceeds. 


Summary of Facts and Representations


1. The Employer is a diversified manufacturer of aluminum composite panels, rigid foam P.V.C. panels and polystyrene
foamcore boards. The Employer has offices and/or production sites in St. Louis, Missouri; Benton, Kentucky and Richmond,
Indiana. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which includes a cash or deferred arrangement under section 401(k) of the
Code. As of December 31, 1993, the Plan had 93 participants and total assets of approximately $1,098,635. Participants
are currently entitled to direct the investment of their account balances among seven investment funds which are
managed by Scudder Investor Services, Inc. On February 12, 1988, prior to the implementation of participant direction,
The Boatmen's National Bank of St. Louis (the Bank),
 as trustee for the Plan, made the decision to invest a portion of the Plan's assets in a collective investment fund maintained
by the Bank and invested primarily in guaranteed investment contracts. The GIC is held as the sole asset of sub-fund
G-11 of the the collective investment fund. The GIC provided a rate of return of 8.65% per annum and a maturity
date of March 1, 1993. 




2. On April 11, 1991, Executive Life was placed into conservatorship by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of
California. The Employer represents that, pursuant to the conservatorship, payouts under the terms of Executive
Life's GICs were suspended.
 In February, 1994, Boatmen's, in its capacity as Plan trustee, elected to participate in the rehabilitation plan
for Executive Life. Although, through the rehabilitation process, the Plan has received $147,386.00 from Executive
Life, the amount of any additional payments to be received over the next several years is undetermined. Consequently,
Boatmen's has frozen that portion of participants' accounts which is attributable to the GIC. This freeze has prevented
Plan participants from exercising the rights they would normally have under the Plan to request distributions and
investment transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GIC.
 The Employer represents that the Loan would preserve the Plan's rights with respect to the GIC, give participants
and beneficiaries the ability to exercise their right to request investment transfers, and provide immediate liquidity
which would facilitate benefit distributions. The proposed Loan will be made in one lump-sum payment in the amount
of the maturity value
 of the GIC, plus post-maturity interest through the date of the Loan, credited at the rate paid on the Collective Employee
Benefit Trust Fund ``S'';
, less any amounts previously received pursuant to the rehabilitation process and the total amount of periodic advances
already made to the Plan. The Employer represents that the Loan is non-interest bearing and the Plan will not incur
any expenses in connection with the transaction. 







3. Repayment of the Loan is limited to payments made to the Plan by or on behalf of Executive Life, or its successor, or
any other responsible third parties. No other assets of the Plan will be available for repayment of the Loan. If the
payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Loan, the Employer will have no recourse
against the Plan, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, for the unpaid amount. In the event that
GIC proceeds exceed the amount necessary to repay the Loan, the excess will be distributed to the Plan for the benefit
of participants and their beneficiaries. The Employer represents that it will maintain records of the proposed Loan
for a period of seven years, and such records will be open for inspection at all times by the Department or any Plan participant.

4. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act because: (1) The transaction will preserve the Plan's ability to allow participant-directed investment
re-allocations; (2) The Plan will not incur any expenses with respect to the transaction; (3) Repayment of the Loan
will be made only from amounts paid to the Plan by Executive Life, its successor, or any other third party; (4) If the
payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Loan, the Employer will have no recourse
against the Plan, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, for the unpaid amount; and (5) Repayment
of the Loan will be waived with respect to the amount by which the Loan exceeds the amount the Plan receives from GIC proceeds.

Regency Marketing Corporation 
Restated Employees Profit Sharing 
Plan and Trust (the Plan) 
Located in West Bloomfield, Michigan; Proposed Exemption 


[Application No. D-9763] 



The Department is considering granting an exemption under section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted,
the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed loan (the Loan) of $84,667 by the Plan to Frankenmuth Brewing Company
(Frankenmuth), a disqualified person with respect to the Plan.

6

 




This proposed exemption is conditioned upon the following requirements: (a) the terms of the Loan are at least as favorable
to the Plan as those obtainable in an arm's length transaction with an unrelated party; 
(b) the Loan does not exceed twenty-five percent of the assets of the Plan at any time during the duration of the Loan;

(c) the Loan is secured by a first deed of trust on certain real property (the Property) which has been appraised by an
independent, qualified appraiser to ensure that the fair market value of the Property is at least 150 percent of the
amount of the Loan; 
(d) the fair market value of the Property remains at least equal to 150 percent of the outstanding balance of the Loan
throughout the duration of the Loan; 
(e) the Plan trustees determine on behalf of the Plan that the Loan is in the best interests of the Plan and protective
of the Plan's participants and beneficiaries; and 
(f) the Plan trustees monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the Loan throughout the duration of the transaction,
taking any action necessary to safeguard the Plan's interest, including foreclosure on the Property in the event
of default. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. Regency Marketing Corporation (Regency) established the Plan on July 1, 1976. On February 1, 1986, the Plan was
frozen due to the dissolution of Regency. Regency was a Michigan corporation engaged as a broker of dairy and other
related products. As of June 30, 1993, the Plan had total assets of $1,892,429. Randall Heine and his wife, Paula Heine,
are the only participants in the Plan. Mr. and Mrs. Heine are the trustees of the Plan (the Trustees) and have sole investment
discretion with regard to the Plan's assets. The Trustees represent that there will be no new participants in the Plan.

Mr. Heine is the majority shareholder of Frankenmuth, a Michigan corporation with its principal place of business
in Frankenmuth, Michigan. Frankenmuth manufactures beer and ale both under its own labels as well as under private
labels. 
2. The Trustees request an administrative exemption from the Department to permit the Loan to Frankenmuth under the
terms and conditions described herein. Frankenmuth proposes to use the loan proceeds towards purchasing the Property
which will be used for Frankenmuth's administrative offices. 
3. The Loan will be in a principal amount of $84,667. The applicant states that at no time will the amount of the Loan represent
more than twenty-five percent of the Plan's total assets. The Loan will be secured by a first deed of trust on the Property,
which consists of a 1,250 square foot improved commercial building and the underlying land. The Property is located
at 435 South Main Street, Frankenmuth, Michigan. The deed of trust will be duly recorded in Saginaw County to reflect
the Plan's security interest in the Property. In addition, Frankenmuth will insure the Property against casualty
loss and designate the Plan as the loss payee of such insurance. 
4. The Loan will have a ten-year term and will be evidenced by a promissory note (the Note). The Note will require Frankenmuth
to make monthly payments of principal and interest which will be fully amortized over the ten-year term. Interest
will accrue on the Loan at 11.5 percent per annum. The Plan will not be required to pay any commissions, fees or other
expenses in connection with the Loan. 
As a condition of the proposed exemption, the terms and conditions of the Loan must be at least as favorable to the Plan
as those which the Plan could obtain in dealing at arm's length with an unrelated party. In this regard, NBD Bank, N.A.
(NBD), an unrelated entity in Troy, Michigan, states in a letter, dated September 22, 1994, that NBD would make a secured
loan of 
$84,667 for an initial term of five years with a fifteen-year amortization schedule allowing for a balloon payment
at the end of the fifth year. At the end of the first five years, NBD would approve a new five-year note with a ten-year
amortization schedule. At the end of the tenth year, NBD would then approve 
a five-year note with a five-year amortization schedule. Interest would accrue within a range of 9.25 percent to 11.5
percent per annum, fixed or floating. In addition, NBD states that it would charge Frankenmuth a loan fee of one percent
or $846. Accordingly, the applicants represent that Frankenmuth will pay a loan fee of $846 to the Plan at the inception
of the Loan. 
5. The Property was appraised by Lewis H. Weiss of Weiss Appraisal Service (Weiss), an appraisal firm located in Frankenmuth,
Michigan. Mr. Weiss is a licensed real estate appraiser in Michigan and has ten years of experience appraising all
types of property. Mr. Weiss represents that both he and Weiss are independent of, and unrelated to, Frankenmuth and
the Trustees. 
Mr. Weiss placed a fair market value of $127,000 as of August 23, 1994. Mr. Weiss utilized the market data approach of
valuation by using comparable sales of commercial buildings located on the same street as the Property. 
6. The Trustees state that the terms of the Loan compare favorably with the terms of similar transactions between untreated
parties and would be a better than arm's length transaction as evidenced by the terms offered by NBD (see Item 

#

5 above). The Trustees represent, that from the Plan's perspective, the terms of the Loan are better than the terms
offered by NBD because the Loan allows the Plan to receive higher monthly payments at an interest rate of 11.5 percent
over a ten- year period rather than at a fixed or floating rate between 9.25 and 11.5 percent over a fifteen-year period.
The Trustees represent that they believe that the Loan is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants and
beneficiaries as an investment for the Plan's portfolio. The Trustees further represent that they will monitor the
Loan throughout its entire duration and will take any appropriate action necessary to protect the interests of the
Plan and its participants and beneficiaries, including a foreclosure on the Property in the event of default. The
Trustees will monitor the Property to ensure that the Loan remains secured by collateral worth at least 150 percent
of the Loan at all times.

7. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an
exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because: 
(a) the terms of the Loan will be at least as favorable to the Plan as those obtainable in an arm's length transaction
with an unrelated party; 
(b) the Loan will not exceed twenty-five percent of the assets of the Plan at any time during the duration of the Loan;

(c) the Loan will be secured by a first deed of trust on certain real property (the Property) which has been appraised
by an independent, qualified appraiser to ensure that the fair market value of the Property is at least 150 percent
of the amount of the Loan; 
(d) the fair market value of the Property will remain at least equal to 150 percent of the outstanding balance of the
Loan throughout the duration of the Loan; 
(e) the Trustees have determined on behalf of the Plan that the Loan is in the best interest of the Plan and protective
of the Plan's participants and beneficiaries; and 
(f) the Trustees will monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the Loan throughout the duration of the transaction,
taking any action necessary to safeguard the Plan's interest, including foreclosure on the Property in the event
of default.

Clarence E. Coker, Jr. and the Clarendon Family Practice, PA Employee Retirement Plan (the Plan) Located in Manning,
South Carolina; Proposed Exemption 


[Application No. D-9736] 



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 C.F.R. Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990.) If the exemption is granted, the restrictions
of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975
of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed sale of approximately
eight acres of unimproved land (the Land) by the Plan to Dr. Clarence E. Coker, Jr., (Dr. Coker), a party in interest
with respect to the Plan; provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 
(a) the proposed sale will be a one-time cash transaction; 
(b) the Plan will receive the higher of: (1) the original acquisition cost

7

; or (2) the current fair market value plus a certain premium related to the adjacency of the Land to other real property
owned by Dr. Coker, established at the time of the sale by an independent qualified appraiser; and 




(c) the Plan will pay no expenses associated with the sale. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Plan is a defined contribution plan that was established January 1, 1974. The Plan has 13 participants, and as
of December 31, 1993, the Plan's total assets were $755,525.96. The sponsor of the Plan is Clarendon Family Practice,
PA (the Employer), which is a South Carolina subchapter ``C'' corporation engaged in family practice medicine. The
Plan's trustee is Dr. Coker who is also the sole shareholder of the Employer. 
2. On May 18, 1982, the Plan purchased the Land for $41,700 from Marian K. Thames, an unrelated third party in a one-time
cash transaction. The applicant represents that at the time of initial acquisition, the Land represented 19.9% of
the Plan's total assets. The Land consists of 8.34 acres of vacant land and is located adjacent to other property owned
by Dr. Coker, individually. The applicant represents that since 1982 the Land has been rented for approximately $400
a year to W. D. Harrington, a neighboring farmer who is unrelated to the Plan and the Employer, as grazing land for animals.
The aggregate rental income received by the Plan for the period 1982-1994 is $5,200. It is represented that the
Land has not been used by a party in interest since it was originally acquired by the Plan. Furthermore, the Land is not
encumbered by any debt. 
3. Dr. Coker in his trustee capacity, upon the advise of a certain certified public accountant, made the original decision
to acquire the Land as a long-term Plan investment.

8

 With respect to the Land, the aggregate real estate taxes for the period 1983-1993 were $153.45. In this regard,
the original acquisition cost (the Original Acquisition Cost) to the Plan for the Land is $36,653.45. The Original
Acquisition Cost was determined as follows $41,700 (original purchase price) + $153.45 (aggregate real estate taxes)
^ $5,200 (aggregate rental income) = $36,653.45. 




4. The Land was appraised on February 11, 1994 (the Appraisal) by W. Burke Watson, Jr., an independent real estate appraiser
certified in the State of South Carolina (Mr. Watson). Mr. Watson relied on the direct sales comparison method and
estimated that as of February 11, 1994, the fair market value of the Land was $12,500. On July 28, 1994, in an update to
the Appraisal, Mr. Burke stated that adjacency of the Land to other property owned by Dr. Coker merits a premium (the
Premium) above the fair market value of approximately $500 per acre, which yields a new purchase price of $17,680 to
Dr. Coker in this transaction.

<TEXT>
 

5. Dr. Coker proposes to purchase the Land from the Plan in a one-time cash transaction. It is represented that as of
December 31, 1993, the Land represented 1.7 percent of the Plan's assets. The applicant represents that the Land has
been depreciating steadily over the years, but that this depreciation became evident to Dr. Coker in 1987. As such,
after conferring with the Plan's consultants and administrators in 1991, Dr. Coker decided that he should sell the
Land because of its steady depreciation and because of its illiquidity. Accordingly, the Land has been listed for
sale with an independent real estate broker from October 1991 to January 1992, but there was no willing buyer. Therefore,
it is represented that the proposed transaction is in the best interest and protective of the Plan because the transaction
will divest the Plan of an asset that has greatly depreciated in value since original acquisition, and will enable
the Plan to invest in vehicles with a higher return. The transaction is protective of the Plan because as a result of
the sale the Plan will receive the higher of: a) the Original Acquisition Cost; or b) the current fair market value plus
the Premium as established at the time of the sale by an independent qualified appraiser. Furthermore, the applicant
represents that any amounts received by the Plan as a result of the proposed transaction, which are in excess of the
fair market value of the Land will be treated as a contribution to the Plan, but that this contribution will not exceed
limitations of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfies the statutory criteria of section 408(a)
of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because: 
(a) the proposed sale will be a one-time cash transaction; 
(b) the Plan will receive the higher of: 1) the Original Acquisition Cost; or 2) the current fair market value plus the
Premium as established at the time of the sale by an independent qualified appraiser; and 
(c) the Plan will pay no expenses associated with the sale. 


Tax Consequences of Transaction 


The Department of Treasury has determined that if a transaction between a qualified employee benefit plan and its
sponsoring employer (or an affiliate thereof) results in the plan either paying less or receiving more than fair market
value, such excess may be considered to be a contribution by the sponsoring 
employer to the plan, and therefore must be examined under the 
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including 
sections 401(a)(4), 404 and 415.

American Express Incentive Savings Plan (the Plan) 
Located in New York, New York; Proposed Exemption 


[Application No. D-9813] 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 C.F.R. Part 2570, Subpart B (55 F.R. 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions
of sections 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975
of the Code, by reason of sections 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the proposed extensions
of credit (the Loans) to the Plan by American Express Company (the Employer), the sponsor of the Plan with respect to
two guaranteed investment contracts (the GICs) issued by Confederation Life Insurance Company (Confederation);
(2) the Plan's potential repayment of the Loans; and (3) the potential purchase of the GICs from the Plan by the Employer
for cash; provided the following conditions are satisfied: 
(A) All terms and conditions of such transactions are no less favorable to the Plan than those which the Plan could obtain
in arm's-length transactions with unrelated parties;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941219-2-00113 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941219-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(B) No interest and/or expenses are paid by the Plan in connection with the transactions; 

(C) The proceeds of the Loans are used solely in lieu of payments due from Confederation with respect to the GICs; 

(D) Repayment of the Loans will be restricted to the GIC Proceeds, defined as the cash proceeds obtained by the Plan
from or on behalf of Confederation with respect to the GICs; 

(E) Repayment of the Loans will be waived to the extent that the Loans exceed the GIC Proceeds; and 

(F) In any sale of the GICs to the Employer, the Plan will receive a purchase price which is no less than the fair market
value of the GICs as of the sale date, and no less than the GICs' accumulated book value, defined as the total principal
deposits plus accrued interest at the rates guaranteed by the GICs, less previous withdrawals and any Loans made pursuant
to this exemption, as of the sale date. 



Summary of Facts and Representations 



1. The Plan is a defined contribution 401(k) plan which provides for individual participant accounts (the Accounts)
and participant-directed investment of the Accounts. The Plan is sponsored by American Express Company (the Employer),
a New York public corporation engaged in diversified travel and financial services. The trustee of the Plan is the
IDS Trust Company (the Trustee), a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDS Financial Corporation, which is wholly owned by
the Employer. The Accounts are invested at the directions of individual Plan participants among nine investment
funds, one of which is the ISP Income Fund (the Income Fund), which invests in, among other things, guaranteed investment
contracts issued by insurance companies. 

2. Among the assets in the Income Fund are two guaranteed investment contracts (the GICs) issued by Confederation
Life Insurance Company (Confederation), a Canadian corporation doing business in the United States through branches
in Michigan and Georgia. Contract 

#

62516 was issued to the Plan by Confederation effective June 28, 1991, upon an initial principal deposit of $10 million,
and it provides for simple annual interest at the rate of 8.72 percent, with a maturity date of June 27, 1996. Contract


#

62764 was issued effective June 1, 1993 upon an initial principal deposit of $5 million and it provides for simple annual
interest at the rate of 6.06 percent, with a maturity date of June 30, 1998. Both GICs are single-deposit non-participating
contracts which allow the Plan to make benefit-responsive withdrawals (the Withdrawals) to fund benefit payments,
investment fund transfers, hardship withdrawals and participant loans (collectively, the Withdrawal Events).
The terms of the GICs provide that interest at the interest rates guaranteed by each GIC (the Contract Rates) will be
credited to the Plan daily, and if the amount of interest earned exceeds the amount of Withdrawals, the difference
will be paid annually (the Interest Payments) on the anniversary of a date specified by each GIC for such Interest Payments.
Conversely, if the amount of Withdrawals exceeds the amount of interest earned during the year, no anniversary Interest
Payment is made. Upon each GIC's maturity date, Confederation is obligated to make a final cash payment to the Plan
(the Maturity Payment) in the amount of the GIC's principal plus interest at the Contract Rate, less previous Withdrawals
(the Maturity Value). 

3. The Employer represents that on August 11, 1994, the Canadian insurance regulatory authorities placed Confederation
into a liquidation and winding-up process, and on August 12, 1994, the insurance authorities of the State of Michigan
commenced legal action to place the U.S. operations of Confederation into a rehabilitation proceeding. As a result
of these actions, the Withdrawals and Interest Payments with respect to the GICs have been suspended.

9

 The Employer represents that it cannot be determined accurately whether, to what extent, or at what time the Withdrawals
and Interest Payments will be resumed. The Employer desires to alleviate the Plan's participants of the risks associated
with continued investment in the GICs, to prevent any losses of the Income Fund's investments in the GIC, and to provide
the Plan with the cash which otherwise would have been provided by the Withdrawals and Interest Payments. Accordingly,
the Employer proposes to make the Loans to the Plan from time to time in the amounts due the Plan under the GICs as Withdrawals
and Interest Payments. Upon the stated maturity date of each GIC, the Employer intends either (1) to purchase each
GIC from the Plan (the Sale), or, alternatively, (2) to make a Loan to the Plan in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value,
depending upon the circumstances prevailing at such time. The Employer is requesting an exemption to permit these
transactions under the terms and conditions described herein. 





3. The Loans and their repayment, and any potential sale of the GICs to the Employer will be made pursuant to a written
agreement (the Agreement) between the Trustee and the Employer. 

The Loans: Under the Agreement, the Employer agrees to make the Loans over the remaining terms of the GICs at such times
and in such amounts as required to enable the Income Fund to fully fund the Withdrawal Events and to fully realize the
Interest Payments, in lieu of the same amounts which otherwise would be paid to the Plan by Confederation as Withdrawals
and Interest Payments. Accordingly, the amount of each Loan will be determined on the basis of the GIC's principal
plus interest at the Contract Rate, less previous Withdrawals, as of the date of the Loan. Each Loan will also be reduced
by any amounts actually received by the Plan, with respect to the particular Withdrawal Event or Interest Payment
due, from Confederation or any other party making payment with respect to Confederation's obligations under the
GICs. In addition to the Loans in lieu of Withdrawals and Interest Payments, the Agreement authorizes the Employer,
as an alternative to purchasing the GICs (as described below in section 4) to make a final Loan with respect to each GIC
upon the GIC's Maturity Date in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value. Any final Loan upon the maturity of each GIC will
be made within thirty days of the Maturity Date in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value plus post-maturity interest
as described in section 4 below. The Employer will receive no interest or fees for any of the Loans, and the Plan will
incur no expenses related to the Loans. 

The Repayments: The Agreement provides that the repayments of the Loans (the Repayments) with respect to each GIC
are restricted to the cash amounts, if any, which the Plan receives with respect to the GIC from Confederation, any
state insurance guaranty funds, any successor to Confederation, or any other third party making payments with respect
to Confederation's obligations under the GICs (collectively, the GIC Proceeds). The GIC Proceeds available to make
the Repayments also include, in the event of any purchase of either GIC, as described below, the purchase price of the
GIC (the Purchase Price). In this regard, in the event of any such sale of a GIC, Repayments of Loans with respect to that
GIC will be accomplished by crediting the total amount of outstanding Loans against the Purchase Price. In any event,
to the extent the Loans exceed total GIC Proceeds, the Repayments will be waived.

4. With respect to the maturity of each GIC, the Agreement enables the Employer to retain the flexibility to decide
upon each GIC's maturity whether to make a final Loan in the amount of the Maturity Value, if not paid when due by or on
behalf of Confederation, or to purchase the GIC from the Plan. The Employer represents that it is unclear under current
conditions whether the purchase of the two GICs by the Employer would jeopardize the ability of the Plan and/or the
Employer to successfully assert rights to protection under the insurance guaranty fund laws of the various states.
The Employer is concerned that, if the two GICs are transferred from the Plan prior to resolution of issues related
to guaranty fund protection, various state guaranty fund associations may deny the full range of protection which
would have been conferred on the Plan and its participants through such insurance guaranty laws. For these reasons,
the Employer would like to wait until the maturity date of each GIC to determine whether to purchase the GIC from the
Plan or to make a Loan to the Plan in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value. The Agreement requires the Employer to make
its decision with respect to the maturity of each GIC, and to consummate the Loan or purchase transaction, within thirty
business days after the maturity date of each GIC, during which the GIC's Maturity Value will earn interest (Post-Maturity
Interest) at the prevailing 30-day U.S. Treasury bill rate, from the date of maturity to the date of the loan or purchase.
In the event the Employer chooses to purchase either of the GICs, the purchase price will be cash in the amount of the
GIC's Maturity Value plus Post-Maturity Interest. The Plan will not incur any expenses related to any sale of the GICs.
In the event the Employer chooses to make a final Loan upon the Maturity of each GIC, each Loan will be in the amount of
the GIC's Maturity Value plus Post-Maturity Interest. 

5. In summary, the Employer represents that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the
Act for the following reasons: 

(1) The transactions will enable the Plan to recover all amounts due with respect to the GICs; 

(2) The Loans will enable the Plan to resume the ability to fund benefit payments, participant loans, hardship withdrawals,
and investment fund transfers within the Plan; 

(3) Repayment of the Loans will be restricted to the GIC Proceeds; 

(4) The Repayments will be waived to the extent the Loans exceed the GIC Proceeds; and 

(5) No interest and/or expenses will be incurred by the Plan with respect to any of the transactions.

Temporary Nature of Exemption 


The exemption, if granted, is temporary and will expire five years from the date of the publication in the 

Federal Register

 of the Final Grant of the proposed exemption. Subsequent to the expiration of this exemption, the Plan may hold any
Loans originated during this five year period until the Loans are repaid or otherwise terminated. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Plan is defined contribution plan having 63 participants and total assets of $4,621,936 as of September 39,
1995. Richfield Bank & Trust Company of Richfield, Minnesota serves as the Plan's trustee (the Trustee). 
2. The Employer is a closely held corporation engaged in the metal-stamping business. The shareholders of the Employer
are Fred P. Berdass and members of his family. In the regular course of its business, the Employer purchases equipment
for its operations. The Employer maintains its principal place of business in Circle Pines, Minnesota. 
3. The Department granted two previous exemptions (Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE) 82-9, 47 FR 2431,
January 15, 1982 and PTE 87-77, 52 FR 29905, August 12, 1987) to permit loans (the Exempt Loans) by the Plan to the
Employer. Under the terms of the exemption, the Plan could make loans on a recurring basis to the Employer for a period
of five years. The proceeds from the Exempt Loans were used by the Employer for the purchases of machinery and equipment.
Each Exempt Loan was collateralized by specific equipment and assets owned by the Employer. The maximum length of
any Exempt Loan was 48 months, and the interest rate was one percent above the prime rate. The balance on total Exempt
Loans did not exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the Plan's assets. An independent fiduciary acted on behalf
of the Plan and certified that each Exempt Loan was an appropriate investment for the Plan. 
The Trustee has confirmed that all payments of principal Loans were received by the Trustee on a timely basis and each
Exempt Loan was paid in full in accordance with the terms of PTE 82-9 and PTE 87-77. 
4. The Plan now proposes to make a series of Loans over a five year period to the Employer. The proceeds from the Loans
will be used by the Employer to purchase the Equipment. Each Loan will be collateralized by a promissory note and security
agreement which provide the Plan with a first lien on the Equipment. In addition, the Loan will be collateralized by
specific equipment or assets which are owned by the Employer. At all times each Loan will be collateralized in an amount
at least equal to 200 percent of the outstanding balance of such loan. The amount of each Loan will not exceed 80% of the
purchase price of the Equipment excluding tax and transportation. In addition, Mr. Berdass will personally guarantee
each Loan. 
The maximum length of any Loan will be 48 months and will have an interest rate of at least one percent above the prevailing
prime rate of interest of the Trustee which is the prevailing interest rate earned on similar loans made by the Trustee
to unrelated third parties. The outstanding Loan balance will not exceed 25 percent of the market value of the assets
of the Plan. The Employer will adequately insure the Equipment and all other collateral against fire and all other
relevant hazards with the Plan being named beneficiary of the insurance. 
4. Lake Elmo Bank, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota (the Bank) will serve as the independent fiduciary with respect to the proposed
Loans. The Bank represents that it is qualified to act as an independent fiduciary with respect to the Loan transactions
and that is understands that its responsibility as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition, the Bank represents that it has
no pre-existing relationship with the Employer nor with Mr. Berdass, and that the income derived from the Employer
and related parties, including the income derived from serving in the capacity of independent fiduciary will not
exceed 1% of the Bank's gross income. 
5. In its capacity as independent fiduciary, the Bank represents that it will determine the appropriateness and suitability
of each Loan prior to the consummation of each Loan transaction. In this regard, the Bank will review the independent
appraisals of the Equipment and the assets pledged to secure the Loans and confirm the sufficiency of such appraisals.
The Bank states that the Loans are appropriate investments for the Plan and are in the best interests of the Plan's participants
and beneficiaries and are protective of their interests. The Bank further states that the terms of the Loans are at
least equal to terms available between the Plan and an unrelated third party. The Bank represents that it will enforce
the terms of the Loan including, but not limited to, making demand for timely payment, bringing suit or other appropriate
process against the Employer in the event of default and monitoring the performance of each Loan. In addition, the
Bank has examined Mr. Berdass's personal financial statements and is assured that as guarantor of the Loans, Mr. Berdass
will continue to have the financial stability to personally assure the repayment of all Loans granted pursuant to
the proposed exemption. 
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction meets the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the rate of return to the Plan on the Loans will equal the prevailing rate
earned on similar loans made by the Trustee; (b) the Plan's interests with respect to the Loans will be represented
by an independent fiduciary who will monitor the Loans as well as the conditions of the exemption, and will take all
appropriate actions necessary to safeguard the best interests of the Plan; (c) the Plan's independent fiduciary
has reviewed the terms and conditions of the proposed exemption and has determined that the Loans are in the best interest
of the Plan's participants and beneficiaries; (d) The independent fiduciary will review and approve each Loan prior
to making any disbursements; (e) the Loans will at all times be secured by the Equipment and other assets of the Employer
which will be valued at not less than 200% of the Loan; (f) the aggregate balance of the outstanding loans will not exceed
25% of the value of the Plan's assets; and (g) the proposed exemption will be of a temporary nature, not to exceed five
years.

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete, and that each application accurately describes all material
terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of Individual Exemptions. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 


Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 


Statutory Findings 


In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible;



(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 



(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

4975(a) and (b) of the Code by reason of sections 4975(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to any transactions
to which those restrictions or taxes would otherwise apply merely because a person is deemed to be a party in interest
or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) with respect to a plan by virtue of providing services to the plan (or
by virtue of having a relationship to such service provider described in section 3(14)(F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Act
or section 4975(e)(2)(F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Code), solely because of the plan's ownership of certificates. 



II. General Conditions 



A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: 

(1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; 

(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced
by other certificates of the same trust; 

(3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the
three highest generic rating categories from either Standard & Poor's Corporation (S&P's), Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff & Phelps Inc. (D & P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch); 

(4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer; 

(5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such obligations (or interests); and the sum
of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than reasonable compensation for the servicer's
services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection
therewith; and 

(6) The plan investing in such certificates is an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of 
Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. 

B. Neither any underwriter, sponsor, trustee, servicer, 
insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any of its affiliates has discretionary authority or renders investment advice
with respect to the plan assets used by a plan to acquire certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part
I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6) above is not satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of
such certificates, provided that (1) such condition is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum;
and (2) in the case of a private placement of certificates, the trustee obtains a representation from each initial
purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance with such condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser
to the effect that, so long as such initial purchaser (or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates)
is required to obtain from its transferee a representation regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933,
any such transferees 
will be required to make a written representation regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection
II.A.(6) above. 



III. Definitions 



For purposes of this exemption: 

A. ``Certificate'' means: 

(1) a certificate_ 

(a) that represents a beneficial ownership

with respect to certificates defined in (1) and (2) above for which ABS or any of its affiliates is either (i) the sole

(1) either 

(a) secured consumer receivables that bear 
interest or are purchased at a discount (including, but not

or are purchased at a discount in transactions by or between business entities (including, but not limited to, qualified

servicing agreement, and rights under any insurance policies, third-party guarantees, contracts of suretyship
and other credit support arrangements with respect to any obligations described in subsection B.(1). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term ``trust'' does not include any investment pool unless: (i) the investment
pool consists only of assets of the type which have been included in other investment pools, (ii) certificates evidencing
interests in such other investment pools have been rated in one of the three highest generic rating categories by S&P's,
Moody's, D & P, or Fitch for at least one year prior to the plan's acquisition of certificates pursuant to this exemption,
and (iii) certificates evidencing interests in such other investment pools have been purchased by investors other
than plans for at least one year prior to the plan's acquisition of certificates pursuant to this exemption. 
C. ``Underwriter'' means: 
(1) ABS; 
(2) any person directly or indirectly, through one or 
more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by or under common control with ABS; or

G. ``Servicer'' means any entity which services loans contained in the trust, including the master servicer and any
subservicer.

also means the trustee of the indenture trust. 
I. ``Insurer'' means the insurer or guarantor of, or 
provider of other credit support for, a trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person is not an insurer solely because
it holds securities representing an interest in a trust which are of a class subordinated to certificates representing
an interest in the same trust. 
J. ``Obligor'' means any person, other than the insurer, that is obligated to make payments with respect to any obligation
or receivable included in the trust. Where a trust contains qualified motor vehicle leases or qualified equipment
notes secured by leases, ``obligor'' shall also include any owner of property subject to any lease included in the
trust, or subject to any lease securing an obligation included in the trust.

note were secured only by the equipment and not the lease. 
U. ``Qualified Motor Vehicle Lease'' means a lease of a motor vehicle where: 
(1) the trust holds a security interest in the lease; 
(2) the trust holds a security interest in the leased 
motor vehicle; and 
(3) the trust's security interest in the leased motor 
vehicle is at least as protective of the trust's rights as the trust would receive under a motor vehicle installment
loan contract.

the Plans, in exchange for shares of such Funds; provided that the following conditions are met: 

(a) A fiduciary (the Second Fiduciary) who is acting on behalf of each affected Plan and who is independent of and unrelated

(1) a current prospectus for each portfolio of each of the Funds in which such Plan is considering investing, 
(2) a statement describing the fees for investment management, investment advisory, or other similar services,

of a Plan, without penalty to such Plan. Such termination will be effected by the Bank selling the shares of the Fund

between the Bank and the Funds; 
(k) In the event of an increase in the rate of any fees paid by the Funds to the Bank regarding any investment management
services, investment advisory services, or fees for similar services that the Bank provides to the Funds over an existing
rate for such services that had been authorized by a Second Fiduciary, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section
II, the Bank will, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such increase, provide a written notice
(which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter, or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus
of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount of the increase in fees) to the Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans
invested in a Fund which is increasing such fees. Such notice shall be accompanied by the Termination Form, as defined
in paragraph (i) of section III below; 
(l) In the event of an addition of a Secondary Service, as defined in paragraph (h) of section III below, provided by

or from the decrease in the number or kind of services performed by the Bank for such fee over an existing rate for such
Secondary Service which had been authorized by the Second Fiduciary of a Plan, in accordance with paragraph (h) of
this section II, the Bank will at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service
for which a fee is charged or fee increase, provide a written notice (which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter,

of the additional service for which a fee is charged or the nature and amount of the increase in fees) to the Second Fiduciary
of each of the Plans invested in a Fund which is adding a service or increasing fees. Such notice shall be accompanied
by the Termination Form, as defined in paragraph (i) of section III below. 
(m) The Second Fiduciary is supplied with a Termination Form at the times specified in paragraphs (k), (l), and (n)

day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile, or other available means at the option
of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written notice of termination; provided that if, due
to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale of shares of such Plans cannot be executed within one business
day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale; and 
(2) failure by the Second Fiduciary to return the Termination Form on behalf of a Plan will be deemed to be an approval

Form is supplied pursuant to paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section II, and will result in the continuation of the authorization,
as described in paragraph (h) of this section II, of the Bank to engage in the transactions on behalf of such Plan; 
(n) The Second Fiduciary is supplied with a Termination Form, annually during the first quarter of each calendar year,

First, the Bank requests modification of the language in Section I(f). This section provides in relevant part that,

The value of the assets of the Plans or the CIFs to be transferred in-kind 

and the net asset value of the Funds receiving those assets 

in exchange for shares is determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner and at the close of business
on the same day, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 17a-7(b) (Rule 17a-7) under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement. 



(Emphasis added). In this regard, the Bank indicated that the valuation procedures described in Rule 17a-7
were used to value the CIF securities transferred to the Funds in the ``conversion'' transaction that occurred on
November 12, 1993, for which retroactive relief has been requested. Further, in connection with the determination
of the net asset value of the Funds' shares to be transferred to the CIFs in that transaction, the trustees of the HighMark
Group (HighMark) decided to use Rule 17a-7 procedures to value certain securities held in the portfolios of
the Funds in cases where those securities were the same as the securities being transferred to the Funds by the CIFs.
However, it is represented that Rule 17a-7 procedures were not used to determine the value of other securities
held in the Fund portfolios where those securities were not the same as those held by the CIFs. The values of such other
Fund securities were instead determined pursuant to procedures permitted under the Investment Company Act and normally
followed by HighMark in determining net asset value. The Bank maintains that it did not intend as a condition of the
exemption that Rule 17a-7 valuation procedures be used to determine the value of all of the Fund's assets for
purposes of ascertaining the number of shares to be issued in connection with a conversion. The Bank believes that
the best approach is to require both parties to a conversion (e.g., a CIF and a Fund) to use the same procedures to value
any securities that are held by both parties, but that compliance with the valuation requirements of Rule 17a-7
should be required only with respect to securities held by a party (such as a CIF) that is not a registered investment
company. In the opinion of the Bank, this would provide assurance that assets transferred in a conversion transaction
are priced appropriately without interfering with the procedures normally employed by a registered investment
company in determining its net asset value. 


In this regard, the Department believes that the most important consideration is that the value of the securities
transferred by the Plan or the CIF into the Fund equal the value of the units of the Fund received in exchange for such
securities by the Plan. Accordingly, we believe that the securities transferred must be valued under the same procedures
by both the transferee and transferor entity (e.g. a CIF and a Fund). In response to the comment, the Department has
reviewed its policies concerning valuation in these types of transactions and has decided to implement the following
changes. The word, ``are,'' before the word, ``value,'' should be deleted and the language of Section I(e) amended
to read as follows: ``The Plans or the CIFs receive shares of the Funds that 

have a total net asset 

value equal in value to the assets of the Plans or the CIFs exchanged for such shares 

on the date of transfer

.'' (The New language is italicized). 
The Department concurs with the applicant's request that Section I(f) be amended by deleting the phrase, ``and the
net asset value of the Funds receiving those assets,'' from the language quoted above to provide that Rule 17a-7
procedures are required to value only assets being transferred to a Fund, and not the assets of the Fund itself. In this
connection, the Department has amended the language of Section I(f) to read as follows: ``The 

current market 

value of the assets of the Plans or the CIFs to be transferred in-kind in exchange for shares is determined in a single
valuation performed in the same manner and at the close of business on the same day, 

using independent sources 

in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 17a-7(b) (Rule 17a-7) under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement, 

and the procedures established by the Funds pursuant to Rule 17a-7 for the valuation of such assets. Such procedures
must require that all securities for which a current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price
for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange or NASDAQ be valued based on an average of the highest
current independent bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding
the weekend of the Plan or CIF transfers determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that
are broker-dealers or pricing services independent of the Bank. 

(The new language is italicized). 
The Bank in another comment requests a modification of the language of Section II(i) and the parallel language in Section
II(m)(1) and Section III(i). The language in these sections requires the Bank to sell Fund shares within one business
day after receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile, or other available means of the Termination
Form or any other written notice from the Second Fiduciary terminating its authorization of investments in the Fund.
The language of these sections provides that if due to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale cannot
be executed within one business day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale. The Bank
believes that the circumstances that may prevent the Bank from completing a sale within one business day (e.g., natural
disaster) may, as a practical matter, also prevent completion of such sale by the second day. Accordingly, the Bank
suggests that the language be amended to make clear that a prohibited transaction will not be considered to have occurred
in such circumstances, if the Bank, due to circumstances that could not be reasonably foreseen by the Bank, is further
prevented from completing the sale by the end of the additional business day. 
The Department believes that the two business day requirement provides ample opportunity for the Bank to execute
sales of shares in the Funds, even in the event circumstances arise which could not reasonably have been foreseen by
the Bank. Accordingly, the Department does not believe that the modification proposed by the Bank would be in the interest
of the Plans, and has determined not to revise the exemption in this manner. 
The Bank also requested a clarification of the scope of relief provided by Section II of the proposed exemption. In
this regard, the language of Section II, as published in the Notice, provides relief from ``the sanctions resulting
from the application of section 4975 of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (D) through (F) of the Code.'' The Bank
believes that the reference to section 4975(c)(1)(D) is a typographical error and requests that the exemption be
corrected to include relief from section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (F) of the Code in order to conform with the scope of
relief provided to other applicants for substantially similar transactions. The Department concurs and has amended
the exemption accordingly.

The Bank also commented on section I wherein it is stated that the Plans involved in the transaction are Plans for which
the Bank serves as trustee, investment manager, or in any other capacity as fiduciary on behalf of the Plan, and on section
II wherein it is stated that the Plans involved in the transaction are Plans for which the Bank serves as fiduciary.
The Bank states that although its original application referred to Plans for which it exercised investment discretion,
it wishes to note for the record that it also serves Plans in other fiduciary capacities that do not involve the exercise
of investment responsibility. In this regard, in addition to the representations contained in paragraph 2 of the
Notice, as of the time of the application, the Bank had custody of approximately $2.5 billion in assets from approximately
1,500 plans for which the Bank does not exercise investment responsibility. 

In response to this comment, the Department acknowledges this additional information. However, the Department
wishes to reiterate that it is not granting relief for transactions afforded relief by Section 404(c) of the Act nor
relief for transactions involving any plan sponsored by the Bank or its affiliates. 

The Bank in its comment letter also requests further modifications and updates to the language of the Summary of Facts
and Representations, as published in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, the Bank requests that representations at pages 42293 through 42294 in Notice be changed to reflect
the fact that HighMark now has eleven (11) portfolios, having established in November 1993, four (4) new non-money
market portfolios, namely the Growth Fund, the Income & Growth Fund, the Balanced Fund, and the Government Bond
Fund, and having merged the Special Growth Equity and Growth Funds in May 1994. It is further represented that the Bank
continues to serve as investment adviser, sub-administrator, sub-transfer agent and custodian, but does not serve
as sub-accountant to HighMark. The Department notes that this additional information will be included in the record
of the exemption. 

The Bank also requests clarification of the language of the fourth sentence of paragraph 3 of the Summary of Facts and
Representation, as published in the 

Federal Register

. In this regard, the Bank wishes to confirm that the exemption does not preclude the Bank from relying on any other available
exemption (e.g., Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 84-24 or Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption
77-4), if the terms and conditions of such exemptions are satisfied and if the Bank deems it appropriate to do
so in a given situation. The Department concurs in this comment, but expresses no opinion regarding the availability
of those exemptions. 

The Bank also comments that the first sentence of paragraph 5 of the Summary of Facts and Representations in the Notice
could be read to suggest that the Bank believes that in-kind transfers of the type covered by Section I of the exemption
are not covered by Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77-4. While the Bank represents that it intends to
follow the requirements of Section I of the exemption in connection with such in-kind transfers, the Bank reiterates
that its position was and is that such transfers also are within the scope of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption
77-4. The Department notes that it has formally expressed its view on this issue. Specifically, the Department
has concluded that the relief provided by Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77-4 is unavailable for the
purchase of shares in mutual funds other than for cash. (See footnote 3 in Advisory Opinion 94-35A, dated November
3, 1994). 

Finally, the Bank wishes to update in three particulars the description of the Bank's automated ``sweep'' service
described in the Summary of Facts and Representations, as published in the 

Federal Register

. In this regard, language in the first paragraph in paragraph 14 of the Notice indicates that purchases and sales of
shares in any of the Funds by the Plans may also occur in connection with daily automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements,
but that agreement to such an arrangement is not a condition for the Plan otherwise choosing to invest in shares of the
Fund, nor will the reverse be required. The Bank maintains that the meaning of the phrase, ``nor will the reverse be
required'' is unclear. It is the Bank's position that, in the exercise of its business judgment regarding the structure
and characteristics of any sweep services it may wish to offer, it may choose to limit investment vehicles made available
under any sweep program to shares of a designated Fund. The Department notes that the sentence in which the phrase,
``nor will the reverse be required,'' appeared was intended to mean that Plans may participate in automated cash ``sweep''
arrangements involving the Funds without being required to invest other plan assets in shares of the Funds and that
Plans may invest in the Funds without being required also to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements
offered by the Bank. 


Second, the Bank wishes to correct a representation in the second paragraph of paragraph 14 of the Notice which states,
in part, that ``all of the Plans served by the Bank had elected to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements
with HighMark.'' According to the Bank, this representation should read that ``substantially all'' of the Plans
served by the Bank had elected to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements with HighMark. The Department
concurs and incorporates this information into the exemption. 

Third, the Bank seeks clarification of the second sentence of the third paragraph of paragraph 14 of the Notice. In
the opinion of the Bank, the sentence could be read to suggest that the ``sweep'' program for a given Plan may involve
investments in more than one of the HighMark money market portfolios at the same time. The Bank represents that while
a Plan may choose from among several such portfolios of HighMark, the ``sweep'' arrangement for a given Plan involves
automatic investments in shares of only one such portfolio at a time. The Department concurs and incorporates the
information on the ``sweep'' program into the exemption. 


After giving full consideration to the entire record, including the written comment from the Bank, the Department
has decided to grant the exemption, as described and concurred in above. In this regard, the comment letter submitted
by the Bank to the Department has been included as part of the public record of the exemption application. The complete
application file, including all supplemental submissions received by the Department, is made available for public
inspection in the Public Documents Room of the Pension Welfare Benefits Administration, Room N-5638, U.S.
Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. 

For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on Wednesday, August 17, 1994, at 59 FR 42289.

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 

 
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application accurately describes all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of
the exemption.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Northern States Power Company; Withdrawal of Application for Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Northern States Power Company
(the licensee) to withdraw its July 13, 1992, application for proposed amendments to Facility Operating License
Nos. DPR-42 and DPR-60 for the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively,
located in Goodhue County, Minnesota.

The proposed amendments would have revised the facility technical specifications to clarify the applicability
of the requirements for containment closure during refueling and to clarify the requirements for operability and
load testing of the fuel handling cranes. The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendments published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 5, 1992 (57 FR 34588). However, by letter dated July 5, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed changes.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated July 13, 1992, and the licensee's
letter dated July 5, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC, and at the local public document room located at the Minneapolis Public Library, Technology and Science Department,
300 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 54401.

<DOCTITLE>In the Matter of Rex Allen Werts (Also Known As: Michael Allen Hunter); Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-Licensed
Activities and Unescorted Access (Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE>



I



Mr. Rex Allen Werts (Also Known As: Michael Allen Hunter) was employed by Power Plant Maintenance, Inc., (PPM) a contractor
of the Carolina Power and Light Company (CP&L or Licensee), from March 24, 1993 until his unescorted access was
revoked on July 26, 1993. Licensee is the holder of License Nos. DPR-62 and DPR-71 issued by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50 on December 27, 1974 and November 12, 1976, respectively.
The licenses authorize the operation of the Brunswick Nuclear Plant in accordance with the conditions specified
therein. The facility is located on the Licensee's site in Southport, North Carolina.



II



On March 24, 1993, Mr. Werts was granted unescorted access to the Brunswick Nuclear Plant, based in part on representations
he made on an access authorization application, dated March 11, 1993, which he submitted to Power Plant Maintenance,
Inc., (PPM), a contractor of the Licensee. In the application, Mr. Werts falsely represented himself as Michael Allen
Hunter and stated that he had not been arrested or convicted of any criminal offense. In addition, Mr. Werts failed
to correct that information after he was granted unescorted access and continued to hold that status on the basis of
his false identity. The Licensee submitted fingerprint cards completed by Mr. Werts to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) and subsequently was informed that Mr. Werts (alias Mr. Hunter) had a record of arrests, convictions, and imprisonments
prior to 1990.



III



Based on the above, Mr. Werts engaged in deliberate misconduct in violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(2) which prohibits any
employee of a licensee or licensee contractor from deliberately submitting to the licensee or licensee's contractor
information the employee knows to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC. Information concerning
an individual's true identity and criminal history is material in that it is used by the Licensee to make determinations
relative to the grant or denial access authorization. If the Licensee has been given accurate information regarding
Mr. Werts' criminal record the Licensee would not have granted unescorted access to Mr. Werts.

The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee, its contractors, and licensee and contractor employees to comply with
NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information that is complete and accurate in all material
respects. Mr. Werts' actions have raised serious concerns as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements
and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC or NRC licensees in the future.

Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that nuclear safety activities can be conducted in compliance
with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public would be protected if Mr. Werts were
permitted at this time to be involved in the performance of licensed activities or were permitted unescorted access
to protected or vital areas of NRC-licensed facilities. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require
that Mr. Werts be prohibited from being involved in the performance of activities licensed by the NRC and be prohibited
from obtaining unescorted access for a period of three years from the date of this Order. For a period of five years from
the date of this Order, Mr. Werts is required to inform the NRC of his acceptance of employment with any employer whose
operations he knows or has reason to believe involve NRC-licensed activities. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202,
I find that the significance of the deliberate misconduct described above is such that the public health, safety and
interest require that this Order be immediately effective.



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 103, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the
Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR 50.5, and 10 CFR 150.20, It is hereby ordered, effective immediately,
that:

A. For a three-year period from the date of this Order, Mr. Rex Allen Werts is prohibited from engaging in activities
licensed by the NRC and is prohibited from obtaining unescorted access to protected and vital areas of facilities
licensed by the NRC. For the purposes of this Order, licensed activities include the activities licensed or regulated
by: (1) NRC; (2) an Agreement State, limited to the Licensee's conduct of activities within NRC jurisdiction pursuant
to 10 CFR 150.20; and (3) an Agreement State where the licensee is involved in the distribution of products that are
subject to NRC jurisdiction.

B. For a five-year period from the date of this Order, Mr. Werts is required to provide notice to the Director, Office
of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, of his acceptance of employment with
any employer whose operations he knows or has reason to believe involve NRC-licensed activities.
The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration
by Mr. Werts of good cause.


V


In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Werts must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an
answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may
consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation,
specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law
on which Mr. Werts or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been
issued. Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Services Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office
of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for
Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, Region II, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, 101 Marietta St. NW., Atlanta, Georgia 30323, and to Mr. Werts, if the answer or hearing request is by a
person other than Mr. Werts. If a person other than Mr. Werts requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity
the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR
2.714(d).
If a hearing is requested by Mr. Werts or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an
Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Werts, or any other person adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.
In the absence of any request for a hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from
the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Cavalier Homes, Inc., Common
Stock, $.10 Par Value) File No. 1-9792</DOCTITLE>



December 13, 1993.



Cavalier Homes, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security (``Security'') from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``Amex.'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing the security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on December 5,
1994 and concurrently therewith such securities were suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its securities on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for its security.

Any interested person may, on or before January 5, 1995 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Advanced Environmental Recycling
Technologies, Inc., Class A Common Stock, $.01 Par Value) File No. 1-10367</DOCTITLE>



December 13, 1994.



Advanced Environmental Recycling Technologies, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security (``Security'') from
listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing the Security from listing and registration include the following:

Due to the limited number of transactions in the Company's stock on the BSE, the Company can no longer justify the time
and expense required to continue listing its securities on that exchange.

Any interested person may, on or before January 5, 1995 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Federal Kemper Life Assurance Company, et al.</DOCTITLE>


December 12, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'' or the ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').





APPLICANTS:

 Federal Kemper Life Assurance Company (``FKLA''), FKLA Variable Separate Account (the ``Separate Account''),
any other separate account established in the future (``Future Accounts'') by FKLA or an affiliated life insurance
company to support certain scheduled premium, single premium, or flexible premium variable life insurance contracts
issued by FKLA or an affiliated life insurance company (the ``Contracts''), and Kemper Financial Services, Inc.
(``KFS'').





RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS:

 Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act and Rules 6e-2(c)(4)(v)
and 6e-3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applications seek an order to permit them to deduct from premiums received under the Contracts an amount that is reasonable
in relation to the increased federal income tax burden resulting from the receipt of such premiums in connection with
the Contracts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. FKLA, a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Illinois, is the depositor of the Separate Account.
FKLA offers life insurance and annuity products and is admitted to do business in the District of Columbia and in all
states except New York. 

2. The Separate Account was established under Illinois law as a separate account of FKLA. The Separate Account, registered
under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, will fund the Contracts issued by FKLA. The Contracts will be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933. The Kemper Investors Fund (the ``Fund''), a registered open-end management investment
company, will serve as the underlying investment medium for the Separate Account.

3. KFS, a registered broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is the principal underwriter for the
Contracts, and will be the principal underwriter of any other variable life insurance policies funded through the
Separate Account or any Future Account (``Future Contracts'').

4. The Contracts are flexible premium individual variable life insurance policies. Applicants represent that the
Contracts will be issued in reliance on Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(i)(B) under the 1940 Act.

5. FLKA will deduct a charge of 1.00% of each premium payment under the Contracts to cover a portion of FKLA's estimated
cost for higher federal corporate income tax liability resulting from changes made to the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (``Code'') by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (``OBRA''), affecting the treatment of deferred
acquisition costs. The requested order also would permit the deduction of up to 1.25% of each premium payment under
Future Contracts.

6. OBRA amended the Code by, among other things, enacting Section 848 thereof. Section 848 changed how a life insurance
company must compute its itemized deductions from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Section 848 requires
an insurance company to capitalize and amortize, over a period of ten years, part of the company's general expenses
for the current year. Under prior law, these general expenses were deductible in full from the current year's gross
income.

7. The amount of deductions that must be capitalized and amortized over ten years, rather than deducted in the year
incurred, is based on ``net premiums'' received in connection with certain types of insurance contracts. Section
848 of the Code defines ``net premium'' for a type of contract as gross premiums received by the insurance company on
the contracts minus return premiums and premiums paid by the insurance company for reinsurance of its obligations
under such contracts. Applicants state that the effect of Section 848 is to accelerate the realization of income from
insurance contracts covered by that Section, and, accordingly, the payment of taxes on the income generated by those
contracts.

8. The amount of general deductions that must be capitalized depends upon the type of contract to which the premiums
received relate and varies according to a schedule set forth in Section 848. Applicants represent that the Contracts
are ``specified insurance contracts'' that fall into the category of life insurance contracts, and, under Section
848, 7.7% of the year's net premiums received must be capitalized and amortized.

9. Applicants represent that the increased tax burden resulting from Section 848 may be quantified as follows. For
each $10,000 of net premiums received under the Contracts in a given year, Section 848 requires FKLA to capitalize
$770 (7.7% of $10,000) and $38.50 of this $770 may be deducted in the current year. This leaves $731.50 ($770 minus $38.50)
subject to taxation at the corporate tax rate of 35% which results in FKLA owing $256.03 (.35  x  $731.50) more
in taxes for the current year than would have been owed prior to OBRA. This current increase in federal income tax will
be partially offset by deductions that will be allowed during the next ten years as a result of amortizing the remainder
of the $770 ($77 in each of the following nine years and $38.50 in the tenth year).

10. In FKLA's business judgment, a discount rate of 8% is appropriate for use in calculating the present value of the
increased future tax deductions resulting from the amortization described above. Applicants state that FKLA seeks
an after tax rate of return on the investment of its capital in excess of 15%. To the extent that capital must be used by
FKLA to meets its increased federal tax burden under Section 848 resulting from the receipt of premiums, such capital
is not available to FKLA for investment. Thus, Applicants argue, the cost of capital used to satisfy FKLA's increased
federal income tax burden under Section 848 is, in essence, FKLA's after tax rate of return on capital; and, accordingly,
the rate of return on capital is appropriate for use in this present value calculation. To the extent that the 8% discount
rate is lower than FKLA's actual targeted rate of return, Applicants submit that a measure of comfort is provided that
the calculation of FKLA's increased tax burden attributable to the receipt of premiums will continue to be reasonable
over time, even if the corporate tax rate applicable to FKLA is reduced, or its targeted rate of return is lowered.

11. In determining the after tax rate of return used in arriving at this discount rate, Applicants state that a number
of factors were considered, including: market interest rates; FKLA's anticipated long term growth rate; the risk
level for this type of business; inflation; and available information about the rates of return obtained by other
life insurance companies. FKLA represents that such factors are appropriate factors to consider in determining
FKLA's cost of capital. Applicants state that FKLA first projects its future growth rate based on the anticipated
sales, the current interest rates, the inflation rate, acceptable risk levels, the amount of capital that FKLA can
provide to support such growth, and industry practice. FKLA then uses the anticipated growth rate and the other factors
enumerated above to set a rate of return on capital that equals or exceeds this rate of growth. Of these other factors,
market interest rates, the acceptable risk levels and the inflation rate receive significantly more weight than
information about the rates of return obtained by other companies.

<TEXT>
 

12. Applicants state that FKLA seeks to maintain a ratio of capital to assets that is established based on its judgment
of the risks represented by various components of its assets and liabilities. Applicants state that maintaining
the ratio of capital to assets is critical to offering competitively priced products and, as to FKLA, to maintaining
a competitive rating from various rating agencies. Consequently, Applicants state that FKLA's capital should grow
at least at the same rate as do its assets.

13. Using a corporate federal income tax rate of 35% and assuming a discount rate of 8%, the present value of the federal
income tax effect of the increased deductions allowable in the following 10 years, which partially offsets the increased
federal income tax burden, comes to $174.60. The effect of Section 848 on the Contracts is, therefore, an increased
federal income tax burden with a present value of $81.43 for each $10,000 of net premiums, i.e., $256.03 minus $174.60.

14. State premium taxes are deductible in computing federal income taxes. Thus, FKLA does not incur incremental federal
income tax when it passes on state premium taxes to owners of the Contracts. Conversely, federal income taxes are not
deductible in computing FKLA's federal income taxes. To compensate FKLA fully for the impact of Section 848, therefore,
it would be necessary to allow FKLA to impose an additional charge that would make it whole not only for the $81.43 additional
federal income tax burden attributable to Section 848 but also for the federal income tax on the additional $81.43
itself. This federal income tax can be determined by dividing $81.43 by the complement of the 35% federal corporate
income tax rate, i.e., 65%, resulting in an additional charge of $125.28 for each $10,000 of net premiums, or 1.25%.
However, FKLA currently intends to deduct 1.00% of each premium payment under the Contracts, which is less than its
increased federal corporate income tax burden. FKLA reserves the rights to increase the charge and to deduct up to
1.25% of each premium payment of Future Contracts.

15. Based on prior experience, FKLA expects that all of its current and future deductions will be fully taken. Applicants
represent that the maximum 1.25% charge, and the current 1.00% charge, to be deducted pursuant to the relief requested,
are reasonably related to their increased federal income tax burden under Section 848, taking into account the capitalization
and amortization permitted by Section 848, and the use by FKLA of a discount rate of 8% in computing the future deductions
resulting from such capitalization and amortization, such rate being lower than, but assumed for these purposes
to be the equivalent of, FKLA's cost of capital.

16. While the application states that FKLA believes that a charge of 1.00% of premium payments would reimburse it for
the impact of Section 848 (as currently written) on FKLA's federal income tax liabilities, the application also states,
however, that FKLA believes that it will have to increase this charge if any future change in, or interpretation of
Section 848, or any successor provision, results in an increased federal income tax burden due to the receipt of premiums.
Such an increase could result from a change in the corporate federal income tax rate, a change in the 7.7% figure, a change
in the categorization of specified insurance contracts, or a change in the amortization period.



 Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an order to the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) exempting them from the provisions of Section
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e-2(c)(4)(v) and 6e-3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder, to the extent necessary
to permit deductions to be made from premium payments received in connection with the Contracts. The deductions would
be in an amount that is reasonable in relation to the increased federal income tax burden related to the receipt of such
premiums. Applicants further request an exemption from Rules 6e-2(c)(4) and 6e-3(T)(c)(4) under the
1940 Act to premit the proposed deductions to be treated as other than ``sales load'' for the purposes of Section 27
of the 1940 and the exemptions from various provisions of that Section found in Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T).
2. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission may by order upon application, conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any person, security or transaction from any provision of the 1940 Act if and to the extent
that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and the provisions of the 1940 Act.
3. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits the sale of periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments (except such amounts as are deducted for sales load) are held under an indenture or agreement containing
in substance the provisions required by Sections 26(a)(2) and 26(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. Certain provisions of Rules
6e-2 and 6e-3(T) provide a range of exemptive relief for the offering of variable life insurance policies
such as the Contracts.

4. Rule 6e-2(c)(4)(v) defines ``sales load'' charged on any payment as the excess of the payment over certain
specified charges and adjustments, including ``a deduction approximately equal to state premium taxes''. Rule
6e-3(T)(c)(4)(v) defines ``sales load'' charged during a contract period as the excess of any payments made
during the period over the sum of certain specified charges and adjustments, including ``a deduction for and approximately
equal to state premium taxes.''

5. Applicants submit that the deduction for federal income tax charges, proposed to be deducted in connection with
the Contracts, should be treated as other than sales load, as is a state premium tax charge, for purposes of the 1940
Act.


6. Applicants argue that the requested exemptions from Rules 6e-2(c)(4) and 6e-3(c)(4) are necessary
in connection with Applicant's reliance on certain provisions of Rules 6e-2(b)(13) and 6e-3(T)(b)(13),
which provide exemptions from Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) of the 1940 Act. Issuers and their affiliates may only
rely on Rules 6e-2(b)(13)(i) or 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(i) if they meet the respective Rule's alternative limitations
on sales load as defined in Rule 6e-2(c)(4) or Rule 6e-3(T)(c)(4). Applicants state that, depending upon
the load structure of a particular Contract, these alternative limitations may not be met if the deduction for the
increase in an issuer's federal tax burden is included in sales load. Although a deduction for an insurance company's
increased federal tax burden does not fall squarely within any of the specified charges or adjustments which are excluded
from the definition of ``sales load'' in Rules 6e-2(c)(4) and 6e-3(T)(c)(4), Applicants state that they
have found no public policy reason for including them in ``sales load.''

7. The public policy that underlies Rules 6e-2(b)(13)(i) and 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(i), like that which underlies
Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) of the 1940 Act, is to prevent excessive sales loads from being charged in connection
with the sale of periodic payment plan certificates. Applicants submit that the treatment of a federal income tax
charge attributable to premium payments as sales load would not in any way further this legislative purpose because
such a deduction has no relation to the payment of sales commissions or other distribution expenses. Applicants state
that the Commission has concurred with this conclusion by excluding deductions for state premium taxes from the definition
of ``sales load'' in Rules 6e-2(c)(4) and 6e-3(T)(c)(4).

8. Applicants assert that the source for the definition of ``sales load'' found in the Rules supports this analysis.
Applicants state that the Commission's intent in adopting such provisions was to tailor the general terms of Section
2(a)(35) of the 1940 Act to variable life insurance contracts. Just as the percentage limits of Sections 27(a)(1)
and 27(h)(1) depend on the definition of ``sales load'' in Section 2(a)(35) for their efficacy, the percentage limits
in Rules 6e-2(b)(13)(i) and 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(i) depend on Rules 6e-2(c)(4) and 6e-3(T)(c)(4),
respectively, which do not depart, in principle, from Section 2(a)(35).

9. Section 2(a)(35) excludes deductions from premiums for ``issue taxes'' from the definition of ``sales load''
under the 1940 Act. Applicants submit that this suggests that it is consistent with the policies of the 1940 Act to exclude
from the definition of ``sales load'' in Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) deductions made to pay an insurance company's
costs attributable to its tax obligations. Section 2(a)(35) also excludes administrative expenses or fees that
are ``not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities.'' Applicants argue that this suggests that the
only deductions intended to fall within the definition of ``sales load'' are those that are properly chargeable to
such activities. Because the proposed deductions will be used to compensate FKLA for its increased federal income
tax burden attributable to the receipt of premiums, and are not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities,
this language in Section 2(a)(35) is another indication that not treating such deductions as ``sales load'' is consistent
with the policies of the 1940 Act.

10. Applicants assert that the terms of the relief requested with respect to Contracts to be issued through the Separate
Account or through Future Accounts are consistent with the standards enumerated in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Without
the requested relief, Applicants would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for each Future Contract. Applicants
state that such additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act not already addressed
in this request for exemptive relief.
11. Applicants assert that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest because it would promote competitiveness
in the variable life insurance market by eliminating the need for Applicants to file redundant exemptive applications,
thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources. The delay and expense involved
in having to seek repeated exemptive relief would impair the ability of Applicants to take advantage fully of business
opportunities as those opportunities arise. Additionally, Applicants state that the requested relief is consistent
with the purposes of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If Applicants were required
to seek exemptive relief repeatedly with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would
not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby and might be disadvantaged as a result of increased overhead
expenses for Applicants.


Conditions for Relief


1. Applicants represent that FKLA will monitor the reasonableness of the charge to be deducted pursuant to the requested
exemptive relief.
2. Applicants represent that the registration statement for each Contract under which the charge referenced in paragraph
one of this section is deducted will : (i) Disclose the charge; (ii) explain the purpose of the charge; and (iii) state
that the charge is reasonable in relation to the increased federal income tax burden under Section 848 of the Code resulting
from the receipt of premiums.
3. Applicants represent that the registration statement for each Contract under which the charge referenced in paragraph
one of this section is deducted will contain as an exhibit an actuarial opinion as to: (i) The reasonableness of the
charge in relation to the increased federal income tax burden under Section 848 resulting from the receipt of premiums;
(ii) the reasonableness of the after tax rate of return that is used in calculating such charge; and (iii) the appropriateness
of the factors taken into account in determining the after tax rate of return.


Conclusion


Applicants submit that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Section
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e-2(c)(4)(v) and 6e-3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder, to permit the deduction
of up to 1.25% of premium payments under the Contracts meet the standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. In this regard,
Applicants assert that granting the relief requested in the application would be appropriate in the public interest
and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
1940 Act.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for an order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Providentmutual Life and Annuity Company of America (``Providentmutual''), Providentmutual Variable Life Separate
Account (the ``Account''), and PML Securities Company (``PML''). (Providentmutual, the Account, and PML shall
be referred to herein collectively as ``Applicants.'')




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act and Rule 6e-3(T)(c)(4)(v)
thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order permitting them and other separate accounts that Providentmutual may establish in the future
to support flexible premium variable life insurance contracts (the ``future accounts'') to deduct from premium
payments received an amount that is reasonable in relation to Providentmutual's increased federal tax burden resulting
from the application of Section 848 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the Commission.



Applicants' Representations



1. Providentmutual, a stock life insurance company incorporated under the name of Washington Square Life Insurance
Company in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1958 and redomiciled as a Delaware insurance company in December 1992,
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company of Philadelphia (``Provident Mutual Life''),
a mutual insurance company chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1865. Providentmutual currently is
licensed to transact life insurance business in 48 states and the District of Columbia.

2. For purposes of the 1940 Act, Providentmutual is depositor and sponsor of the Account (and would be the depositor
and sponsor of any future accounts) as those terms have been interpreted by the Commission with respect to variable
life insurance company separate accounts.

3. Providentmutual currently is developing a new flexible premium adjustable variable life insurance contract
(the ``Contract'') which includes the ``tax burden charge'' identified above and as explained more fully below.
Providentmutual also anticipates that it would include such a charge in future flexible premium variable life insurance
contracts (``future contracts'') that it may develop.

4. The Contract and any future contracts issued by Providentmutual may be supported by the Account or any future accounts.

5. The Account was established by Providentmutual as a separate investment account under Delaware law on June 30,
1994, as a funding vehicle for variable life insurance contracts. The Account will be registered under the 1940 Act
as a unit investment trust. The Account will be divided into subaccounts, each of which will invest exclusively in
the shares of a designated investment portfolio of a specified open-end management investment company registered
under the 1940 Act. 

6. Under Delaware law, amounts allocated to the Account are owned by Providentmutual. To the extent provided under
the Contract, however, that portion of the assets of the Account equal to the reserves and other Contract liabilities
pertaining to the Account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business Providentmutual
may conduct. The income, gains and losses, realized and unrealized, from the assets allocated to the Account are credited
to or charged against the Account without regard to other income, gains or losses of Providentmutual. The Account
is, and any future account will be, a ``separate account,'' as defined by Rule 0-1(e) under the 1940 Act. 

7. PML is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company of Philadelphia. PML acts
as principal underwriter, as defined in the 1940 Act, of the variable life insurance contracts supported by the Account.
PML is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Applications for the Contracts and future contracts will be solicited by registered
representatives of PML, or other broker-dealers having selling agreements will PML, who are licensed by applicable
state insurance authorities to sell flexible premium variable life insurance contracts. 

8. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code'')
by, among other things, enacting Section 848 thereof. Section 848 changed the federal income taxation of life insurance
companies by requiring them to capitalize and amortize over a period of ten years part of their general expenses for
the current year. Under prior law, these expenses were deductible in full from the current year's gross income. 

9. The amount of expenses that must be capitalized and amortized under Section 848 is generally determined with reference
to premiums for certain categories of life insurance and other contracts (``specified contracts''). Thus, for each
specified contract, an amount of expenses must be capitalized and amortized equal to a percentage of the current year's
net premiums (i.e., gross premiums minus return premiums and reinsurance premiums) for that contract. The percentage
varies, depending on the type of specified contract in question, according to a schedule set forth in Section 848(c)(1).


10. Although framed in terms of requiring a portion of a life insurance company's general expenses to be capitalized
and amortized, Section 848 in effect accelerates the realization of income from specified contracts for federal
income tax purposes and, therefore, the payment of taxes on the income generated by those contracts. When the time
value of money is taken into account, this has the economic consequence of increasing the tax burden borne by the insurance
company that is attributable to such contracts. Because the amount of general deductions that must be capitalized
and amortized is measured by premiums paid for specified contracts, an increased tax burden results from the receipt
of those premiums. In this respect, the impact of Section 848 can be compared with that of a state premium tax. 

11. The Contract and any future contracts to which the ``tax burden charge'' will be applied are among the specified
contracts. They fall into the category of life insurance contracts for which the percentage of net premiums that determines
the amount of otherwise currently deductible general expenses to be capitalized and amortized with respect to such
contracts is 7.7 percent. 

12. The increased tax burden resulting from the applicability of Section 848 to every $10,000 of net premiums received
may be quantified as follows. In the year when the premiums are received, Providentmutual's general deductions are
reduced by $731.50_i.e., an amount equal to (a) 7.7 percent of $10,000, or $770, minus (b) one-half year's portion
of the ten-year amortization, or $38.50. Using a 35 percent corporate tax rate, this works out to an increase in tax
for the current year of $256.03. This reduction will be partially offset by increased deductions that will be allowed
during the next ten years as a result of amortizing the remainder of the $770_$77 in each of the following nine years,
and $38.50 in the tenth year. 

13. To the extent and capital must be used by Providentmutual to satisfy its increased federal tax burden under Section
848 resulting from the receipt of premiums, such profits are not available to Providentmutual for investment. Accordingly
Providentmutual submits that its targeted rate of return is appropriate for use in this present value calculation.
Because it seeks an after tax rate of return of 9.3 percent on its invested capital
 Providentmutual submits that a discount rate of at least 9.3 percent is appropriate for use in calculating the present
value of its future tax deductions resulting from the amortization described above. 




14. Using a corporate tax rate of 35 percent, and assuming a discount rate of 9.3 percent, the present value of the tax
effect of the increased deductions allowable in the following ten years comes to $165.16. Because this amount partially
offsets the increased tax burden, applying Section 848 to the specified contracts imposes an increased tax burden
on Providentmutual equal to a present value of $90.87 (i.e., $256.03 minus $165.16) for each $10,000 of net premiums.

15. Because state premium taxes are deductible when computing federal income taxes, Providentmutual does not incur
incremental income tax when it passes on state premium taxes to contract owners. In contrast, federal income taxes
are 

not 

tax-deductible when computing Providentmutual's federal income taxes. Therefore, to offset fully the impact of
Section 848, Providentmutual must impose an additional charge that would make it whole not only for the $90.87 additional
tax burden attributable to Section 848, but also for the tax on the additional $90.87 itself. This additional charge
can be computed by dividing $90.87 by the complement of the 35 percent federal corporate income taxe rate (

i.e., 

65 percent), resulting in an additional charge of $139.80 for each $10,000 of net premiums, or 1.40 percent of net premiums.

16. Tax deductions are of value to Providentmutual only to the extent that it has sufficient gross income to fully utilize
the deductions. Based on its prior experience, Providentmutual submits that it can reasonably expect to have sufficient
taxable income in future years to utilize all deferred acquisition cost deductions.

17. Providentmutual submits that a charge of 1.25 percent of premium payments would reimburse it for the impact of
Section 848 (as currently written) on its federal tax liabilities. Providentmutual represents that a 1.25 percent
charge is reasonably related to its increased tax burden under Section 848, taking into account the benefit to Providentmutual
of the amortization permitted by Section 848, and the use by Providentmutual of a 9.3 percent discount rate in computing
the future deductions resulting from such amortization, such rate being the equivalent of Providentmutual's cost
of capital.

18. Providentmutual asserts that it would have to increase the 1.25 percent charge if future changes in, or interpretations
of, Section 848 or any successor provision result in a further increased tax burden resulting from the receipt of premiums.
Such an increase could result from a change in the corporate tax rate, a change in the 7.7 percent figure, or a change
in the amortization period. The Contract and any future contracts issued by Providentmutual will reserve the right
to increase or decrease the 1.25 percent charge in response to future changes in, or interpretations of, Section 848
or any successor provision that increase or decrease Providentmutual's tax burden.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in relevant part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may exempt
any person, security or transaction (or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions) from provisions
of the 1940 Act or any rules thereunder, if and to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the 1940 Act.

2. Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, exempting them from the provisions
of Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act and Rule 6e-3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder to the extent necessary to permit Applicants
to deduct from premium payments received in connection with the Contracts and any future contracts an amount that
is reasonable in relation to Providentmutual's increased federal tax burden created by its receipt of such premium
payments. The deduction would not be treated as sales load.



A. Relief From Provisions of Section 27(c)(2) and Rule 6e-3(T)(c)(4)(v)



1. Section 2(a)(35) of the 1940 Act defines ``sales load'' as the difference between the price of a security offered
to the public and that portion of the proceeds from its sale which is received and invested or held for investment by
the issuer (or in the case of a unit investment trust, by the depositor or trustee), less any portion of such difference
deducted for trustees's or custodian's fees, insurance premiums, issue taxes, or administrative expenses or fees
which are not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities.

2. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits a registered investment company or a depositor or underwriter for such
company from making any deduction from purchase payments made under periodic payment plan certificates other than
a deduction for sales load. Sections 27(a) (1) and 27(h)(1) of the 1940 Act, in effect, limit sales loads on periodic
payment plan certificates to 9 percent of total payments.

3. Paragraph (a) of Rule 6e-3(T) requires that a separate account (such as the Account or any future accounts)
that issues flexible premium variable life insurance contracts, its principal underwriter and its depositor, comply
with all provisions of the 1940 Act and rules thereunder applicable to a registered investment company issuing periodic
payment plan certificates.

4. Paragraph (b) of Rule 6e-3(T) provides numerous limited conditional exemptions from most such provisions
and rules in connection with the offer, sale and administration of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts.
For example, among other things, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(iii)(E) provides relief from Section 27(c)(2) of the
1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of certain charges other than sales load, including ``[t]he
deduction of premium or other taxes imposed by any state or other governmental entity.'' Applicants request the relief
from Section 27(c)(2) sought in this application only to preclude the possibility that a charge related to the increased
burden resulting from Section 848 of the Code is not covered by the exemption provided by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(iii)(E).
Applicants submit that the public policy reasons underlying Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(iii)(E) provide support
for the exemption from Section 27(c)(2) requested herein. In this regard, Applicants note that the Commission previously
has issued orders granting substantially similar relief to that requested by Applicants, including an order to Providentmutual's
corporate parent under nearly identical circumstances.






5. Applicants represent that the requested exemption is necessary if they are to rely on Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(i)
under the 1940 Act, which provides critical exemptions from Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) thereof. Applicants
note that issuers and their affiliates may rely on Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(i) only if they meet its alternative
limits that apply to ``sales load,'' as defined in rule 6e-3(T)(c)(4). Rule 6e-3(T)(c)(4) defines ``sales
load'' during a contract period as the excess of any payments made during that period over certain specified charges
and adjustments, including a deduction for and approximately equal to state premium taxes. Applicants represent
that a ``tax burden charge'' such as the one Providentmutual proposes to deduct does not fall squarely into any of the
itemized categories of charges or adjustments. Applicants note that a literal reading of Rule 6e-3(T)(c)(4)
arguably does not exclude such a ``tax burden charge'' from sales load.

6. Applicants maintain, however, that there is no public policy reason why a ``tax burden charge'' designed to cover
the expense of federal taxes should be treated as sales load or otherwise be subject to the sales load limits of Rule
6e-3(T). Applicants also assert that nothing in the administrative history of Rule 6e-3(T) (or, for that
matter, in the administrative history of Rule 6e-2, its predecessor rule) suggests that the Commission intended
to treat tax charges as sales load.



7. Applicants assert that the public policy that underlies Rule 6e-3T(b)(13)(i), like that which underlies
Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1), is to prevent excessive sales loads from being charged in connection with the sale
of periodic payment plan certificates. Applicants submit that the treatment of a ``tax burden charge'' attributable
to the receipt of purchase payments as sales load would in no way further this legislative purpose because such a deduction
has no relation to the payment of sales commissions or other distribution expenses.



8. Applicants assert that the genesis of Rule 6e-3T(c)(4) supports this analysis. in this regard, Applicants
note that Section 2(a)(35) of the 1940 Act provides a scale against which the percent limits of Sections 27(a)(1) and
27(h)(1) thereof may be measured. Applicants submit that the Commission's intent in adopting Rule 6e-3T(c)(4)
was to tailor the general terms of Section 2(a)(35) to flexible premium variable life insurance contracts in order,
among other things, to facilitate verification by the Commission of compliance with the sales load limits set forth
in Rule 6e-3T(b)(13)(i). Applicants submit that Rule 6e-3T(c)(4) does not depart, in principal, from
Section 2(a)(35), and that both Section 2(a)(35) and Rule 6e-3T(c)(4) define ``sales load'' derivatively.
 


9. Applicants further assert that Section 2(a)(35) clearly excludes from the definition of ``sales load'' under
the 1940 Act deductions from purchase payments for ``issue taxes.'' Applicants submit that the exclusion of charges
for expenses attributable to federal taxes from sales load (as defined in Section 2(a)(35)) is consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. By extension, Applicants
submit, it is equally consistent to exclude such charges, including the ``tax burden charge'' described above, from
the definition of ``sales load'' in Rule 6e-3T(c)(4).



10. Applicants submit that the reference in Section 2(a)(35) to administrative expenses or fees that are ``not properly
chargeable to sales or promotional activities'' suggests that the only charges or deductions intended to fall within
the definition of ``sales load'' are those that 

are

 properly chargeable to such activities. Because the proposed ``tax burden charge'' will be used to pay costs attributable
to Providentmutual's federal tax liabilities, and such costs are not properly chargeable to sales or promotional
activities, Applicants assert that the language of Section 2(a)(35) is another indication that not treating the
proposed ``tax burden charge'' as sales load is consistent with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions
of the 1940 Act.



11. Applicants state that the specification of only state premium taxes in Rule 6e-3T(c)(4)(v) probably is
an historical accident, related to the fact that the Section 848 tax burden attributable to the receipt of premiums
did not exist when Rule 6e-3T was initially adopted in 1984 and amended in 1987. Applicants note that nothing
in the administrative history of Rule 6e-3(T) suggests that the exclusion from the definition of ``sales load''
of deductions for tax liabilities attributable to the amount of premium payments received was tried to the type of
government entity imposing such taxes.

<DOCNO> FR941219-2-00151 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941219-2-00079 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

12. For these reasons, Applicants assert that deducting a charge from variable life insurance contract premium payments
for an insurer's tax burdens attributable to its receipt of such payments and excluding that charge from sales load
is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Applicants submit that this is because such a charge is for a legitimate
expense of the insurer and is not designed to cover sales and distribution expenses. Applicants note that, in adopting
Rule 6e-3(T) and its analog, Rule 63-2, which applies to schedule premium variable life insurance contracts,
the Commission considered similar deductions for tax burdens in respect of premium taxes. In each case, the Commission
permitted deductions for such taxes to be made and to be treated as other than sales load. Applicants submit that the
propriety of a charge for an insurer's tax burden attributable to premium payments received is the same whether such
burden arises under state or federal law.


B. Request for ``Class Relief''


1. Applicants note that the relief sought herein applies to existing Accounts as well as to future accounts that Providentmutual
may establish to support flexible premium variable life insurance contracts. Such future accounts may be established
as additional investment options under previously issued contracts. Such future accounts may be established as
additional investment options under previously issued contracts that have a ``tax burden charge'' or as investment
options for new contracts that may have a ``tax burden charge.''
2. Applicants submit that because the terms of any exemption sought for the future accounts to permit the deduction
of a ``tax burden charge'' would be substantially identical to those in this application, any additional requests
for exemptive relief for the future accounts would present no issues under the 1940 Act that have not already been addressed
in this application. Applicants note, however, that unless the ``class relief'' requested herein is granted, Providentmutual
would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for each future account to the extent required. For the reasons set
forth below, Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and are consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
3. Applicants submit that the requested ``class relief'' would promote competitiveness in the variable life insurance
market by eliminating the need for Providentmutual to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing
its administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. Applicants submit that the delay
and expense involved in having repeatedly to seek the same exemptions would impair Providentmutual's ability to
effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.
4. Applicants further submit that owners of Contracts and future contracts would receive no benefit or additional
protection if Providentmutual were required repeatedly to seek Commission orders with respect to the same issues
addressed in this application; indeed, they might be disadvantaged as a result of Providentmutual's increased overhead
expenses.


Conditions for Relief


1. Applicants agree to comply with the following conditions for relief:
a. Providentmutual will monitor the reasonableness of the 1.25 percent charge.
b. The registration statement for the Contract and for any future contracts under which the 1.25 percent charge is
deducted will include: (i) disclosure of the charge; (ii) disclosure explaining the purpose of the charge; and (iii)
a statement that the charge is reasonable in relation to Providentmutual's increased tax burden as a result of applying
Section 848 of the Code.
c. Providentmutual also will include an exhibit to the registration statement for the Contract and for any other variable
life insurance contract under which the 1.25 percent charge is deducted an actuarial opinion as to: (i) the reasonableness
of the charge in relation to Providentmutual's increased tax burden as a result of Section 848 of the Code; (ii) the
reasonableness of the after tax rate of return used in calculating the charge; and (iii) the appropriateness of the
factors taken into account by Providentmutual in determining the after tax rate of return.


Conclusion


Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Section 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act and Rule 6e-3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder to permit the deduction of 1.25 percent of premium payments
under the Contracts and any future contracts meet the standards of Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. In this regard, Applicants
assert that granting the requested relief would be appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing of Options on the Amex Airline Index </DOCTITLE>



December 12, 1994. 



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons. 



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The Exchange proposes to trade options on The Amex Airline Index (``Index''), a new stock index developed by the Amex
based on airline industry stocks (or ADRs thereon) which are traded on the Amex, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''),
or are national market system (``Nasdaq/NMS'') securities traded through Nasdaq. In addition, the Amex proposes
to amend Rule 901C, Commentary .01 to reflect that 90% of the Index's numerical index value will be accounted for by
stocks that meet the current criteria and guidelines set forth in Rule 915. The text of the proposed rule change is available
at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission. 



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has
prepared summaries, set forth in Section (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.




(A)

 Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 



The Amex has developed a new industry-specific index called The Amex Airline Index, based entirely on shares of widely-held
airline industry stocks or American Depository Receipts (``ADRs'') which are exchange listed or are Nasdaq/NMS
securities.

1

 It is intended that the Amex list standardized option contracts on the newly developed Index. The Exchange is filing
this proposal pursuant to Rule 901C, Commentary .02, which provides for the commencement of trading of options on
the Index thirty days after the filing date, 

i.e.,

 30 days after December 7, 1994. The Exchange represents that the proposal satisfies all the criteria set forth in Commentary
.02 to Rule 901C and the Commission's order approving that rule as outlined below.

2 







Eligibility Standards for Index Components


Pursuant to Commentary .02 to Amex Rule 901C, the Amex represents that all of the component securities of the Index
are listed on the NYSE or are Nasdaq/NMS securities, each of the component securities has a minimum market capitalization
of at least $75 million,

3

 and each has a monthly trading volume of at least one million shares per month over each of the six months preceding the
filing of this proposal. In addition, all of the component securities in the Index have standardized options traded
on them and thus have met the initial eligibility criteria for standardized options trading set forth in Amex Rule
915. One component (USAir Group), however, has traded below $5 during two of the last six months. While it is not known
at this point whether options on USAir Group will eventually be delisted, the Index would still satisfy the criteria
set forth in Commentary .02 to Rule 901C because as a result of each quarterly rebalancing, at least 90% of the value
of the Index and at least 80% of the total number of components will meet the standards set forth in Rule 915.

<DOCNO> FR941219-2-00153 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941219-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As a result of the ``equal dollar-weighting'' calculation methodology,
 no individual component stock in the Index represents more than 25% of the weight of the Index following each quarterly
rebalancing. Additionally, the top five highest weighted stocks in the Index do not constitute more than 60% of the
weight of the Index. Finally, because the sole ADR component of the Index (British Airways PLC) has standardized options
trading on it, the Index also satisfies the criteria that no more than 20% of the weight of the Index can be composed of
non-options eligible foreign securities (including ADRs).





Maintenance of the Index



The Exchange will maintain the Index so that (1) the total number of component securities will not increase or decrease
by more than 331/3% from the number of components in the proposed Index (

i.e.

, 10) and in no event will the Index have less than nine components; (2) component stocks constituting the top 90% of
the Index by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $75 million and the component stocks constituting
the bottom 10% of the Index, by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $50 million; (3) the monthly trading
volume of each component security shall be at least 500,000 shares, provided, however, that components accounting
in aggregate for no more than 10% of the Index, by weight, shall have a monthly trading volume of at least 400,000 shares;
and (4) the Index shall satisfy the criteria that no single component will represent more than 25% of the weight of the
Index and that the five highest weighted component shall represent no more than 60% of the weight of the Index, as of
each quarterly rebalancing.

The Exchange shall not open for trading any additional option series should the Index fail to satisfy any of the maintenance
criteria set forth above unless such failure is determined by the Exchange not to be significant and the Commission
concurs in that determination.



Index Calculation



The Index is calculated using an ``equal dollar-weighting'' methodology designed to ensure that each of the component
securities is represented in an approximately ``equal'' dollar amount in the Index. The Exchange believes that this
method of calculation is important since even among the largest companies in the airline industry there is great disparity
in market value. For example, although the stocks included in the Index represent many of the most highly capitalized
companies in the airline industry, the five most highly capitalized companies in the airline industry currently
represent approximately 80% of the aggregate market value of the Index. It has been the Exchange's experience that
options on market value weighted indexes dominated by relatively few component stocks are less useful to investors
because the index will tend to represent those few components and not the broader target sector that the index is designed
to represent.

The following is a description of how the equal dollar-weighting calculation method works. As of the market close
on October 21, 1994, a portfolio of airline securities was established representing an investment of $10,000 in the
stock (or ADR) (rounded to the nearest whole share) of each of the companies in the Index. The value of the Index equals
the current market value (

i.e.,

 based on U.S. primary market prices) of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the securities in the Index
portfolio divided by the Index divisor. The Index divisor was initially determined to yield the benchmark value of
200.00 at the close of trading on October 21, 1994. Each quarter thereafter, following the close of trading on the third
Friday of January, April, July, and October, the Index portfolio will be adjusted by changing the number of whole shares
of each component security so that each company is again represented in ``equal'' dollar amounts. The Exchange has
chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows an option contract
to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio while at the same time, maintaining the equal
dollar-weighting feature of the Index. If necessary, a divisor adjustment is made at the rebalancing to ensure continuity
of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes the basis for the Index's value on the first trading day
following the quarterly adjustment.

<TEXT>
 

As noted above, the number of shares of each component security in the Index portfolio remains fixed between quarterly
reviews except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend other than an ordinary
cash dividend, a stock distribution, stock split, reverse stock split, rights offering, distribution, reorganization,
recapitalization, or similar event with respect to the component securities. In a merger or consolidation of an issuer
of a component security, if the stock or ADR remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security in the portfolio
may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to maintain the component's relative weight in the Index at the level immediately
prior to the corporate action. In the event of a stock or ADR replacement, the average dollar value of the remaining
portfolio components will be calculated and that amount invested in the security of the new component, to the nearest
whole share. In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure Index continuity.

The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index, and pursuant to Exchange Rule 901C(b) may at any time or from time to
time substitute securities, or adjust the number of securities included in the Index based on changing conditions
in the airline industry. In the event, however, that the Exchange determines to increase the number of Index components
to greater than thirteen or to reduce the number of components to fewer than nine, the Exchange will submit a 19b-4
filing to the Commission. In selecting securities to be included in the Index, the Exchange will be guided by a number
of factors including market value of outstanding shares, trading activity, and adherence to Rule 901C, Commentary
.02. Similar to other stock index values published by the Exchange, the value of the Index will be calculated continuously
and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape Association's Network B.



Expiration and Settlement



The proposed options on the Index are European-style,
 and cash-settled. The Exchange's standard option trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. Eastern Standard Time) will
apply to Index options. The options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration
month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an Index option series will normally be the second to last business
day preceding the Saturday following Expiration Friday (normally a Thursday). Trading in expiring Index options
will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day.





The Exchange plans to list Index options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the
two additional calendar months in the January cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six
months to expiration may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options based on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange
may instead list long-term, reduced-value put and call options based on one tenth (1/10th) of the Index's full value.
In either event, the interval between expiration months for either a full-value of reduced-value long-term Index
option will not be less than six months. The trading of any long-term Index options would be subject to the same rules
which govern the trading of all the Exchange's index options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements,
and floor trading procedures. Position limits on reduced-value long-term Index options will be equivalent to the
position limits for regular (full-value) Index options and would be aggregated with such options. For example, if
the position limit for the full-value options on the Index is 10,500 contracts on the same side of the market, then the
position limit for the reduced-value options will be 105,000 contracts on the same side of the market and positions
in reduced-value Index options will be aggregated with positions in full-value Index options.

The exercise settlement value for all of the expiring Index options will be calculated based upon the primary exchange
regular way opening sale prices for the component securities. In the case of Nasdaq/NMS securities, the first reported
sale price will be used. If any component security does not open for trading on its primary market on the last day before
expiration, then the prior day's last sale price will be used in the exercise settlement value calculation.


Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options


Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of option contracts based on the Index. These rules cover issues
such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor
trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. The
Index is deemed to be a Stock Index Option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Industry Group under Rule 900C(b)(1).
With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money (

i.e., 

strike prices within ten points above or below the current Index value) option series on the Index at 21/2 intervals
only when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange expects that the review required by Rule
904C(c) will result in a position limit of 10,500 contracts with respect to options on this Index.

The Amex represents that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5)
 in particular in that it will permit trading in options based on the Amex Airline Index pursuant to rules designed to
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system.

7

 the Exchange may not list Amex Airline Index options for trading prior to 30 days after December 7, 1994, the date the
proposed rule change was filed with the Commission. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change,
the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes
of the Act.





IV. Solicitation of Comments

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Depository Eligibility of New Issue Municipal Securities</DOCTITLE>


December 9, 1994.



On August 17, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSRB-94-13) pursuant to Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposal was published on September 6, 1994, in the 

Federal Register

 to solicit comments on the proposed rule change.
 Eleven comment letters were received.
 For reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.







I. Description



The proposed rule change amends MSRB Rule G-34 to require generally that dealers acquiring new issue municipal
securities apply for depository eligibility. This amendment is designed to facilitate the movement of municipal
securities to a three business day (``T+3'') settlement time frame.
 Because interdealer and institutional customer transactions are settled on a delivery vs. payment or receipt vs.
payment (``DVP/RVP'') basis, it is critical that the delivery of securities be made in a timely manner on the settlement
date. The physical delivery of securities certificates, however, is relatively time-consuming and inefficient
as compared to book-entry delivery through a securities depository. A shortened settlement cycle will provide dealers,
institutional customers, and their clearing agents with less time to deal with the processing requirements and inevitable
problems that arise in connection with transportation, delivery, and acceptance of physical securities certificates.




MSRB Rules G-12(f)(ii) and G-15(d)(iii) require essentially all interdealer and institutional customer
transactions be settled by book-entry when the securities involved in the transactions are listed as eligible for
deposit in a depository. The proposed rule change facilitates book-entry settlement of transactions in municipal
securities by requiring, with limited exceptions, that dealers that acquire new issue municipal securities apply
for depository eligibility.

Under the proposed rule change, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers are required to apply for depository
eligibility within one business day of the date of sale of a new issue municipal security.
 The proposed rule change exempts (1) issues not meeting the eligibility criteria of all depositories that accept
municipal securities for deposit and (2) issues maturing in sixty days or less. The proposed rule change also provides
an exemption until July 1, 1996, for issues under $1 million in par value.




MSRB has asked that the proposed rule change become effective sixty days from the date of approval. Therefore, the
proposed rule change will be effective on February 7, 1995.

II. Comments


In March 1994, MSRB requested comment on a draft of the amendment to Rule G-34 (``Draft Amendment''). The Draft
Amendment included exemptions for issues not meeting the criteria set by depositories for eligibility and for new
issues under $1 million in par value. MSRB received eleven comment letters in response to the draft amendments.
 The comments generally supported the MSRB's proposal. Five commenters felt that the proposed rule change could facilitate
T+3 settlement.
 Two commenters noted that settlement through a depository was more efficient and provided greater cost savings than
settlement with physical certificates.
 Some commenters, however, suggested modifications to the draft amendments. In response to these comments, the MSRB
amended their proposal prior to filing the proposed rule change with the Commission.








A. Exemption Until July 1, 1996, for Issues Under $1 Million in Par Value


The Draft Amendment included exemptive language for issues under $1 million in par value.
 Nine commenters urged the MSRB to include issues under $1 million in par value within the scope of the rule with most
citing the need for increased settlement efficiencies offered by book-entry when T+3 becomes effective.
 Two commenters noted that ultimately all issues should be included within the scope of the rule but suggested a temporary
exemption for small issues because of their belief that some underwriters of small issues may need time to adjust their
procedures for book-entry distribution.
 Only the Summers letter stated that a permanent exemption for small issues should be included. In response to these
comments, the MSRB amended its proposal prior to filing with the Commission to include issues under $1 million in par
value but to provide a temporary exemption for such issues until July 1, 1996.

B. Other Suggested Exemptions


The Summers letter suggested exempting municipal leases municipal notes, and municipal bonds sold to nondepository
participants. The MSRB rejected this suggestion, stating that it was not aware of any reason that these types of securities
should be treated differently than other municipal securities.


III. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Section 15B(b)(2)(C).
 Section 15B(b)(2)(C) requires that the rules of the MSRB be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities. The
proposed rule change meets this requirement by creating a more efficient, safe, and cohesive environment for the
transfer of municipal securities.




By requiring dealers acquiring new issue municipal securities to apply for depository eligibility, the proposal
will help to ensure that the great majority of new issue municipal securities are made depository eligible. As a result,
the number of interdealer and institutional customer transactions that must be settled by book-entry under MSRB
Rules G-12(f)(ii) and G-15(d)(iii) should increase greatly. By increasing the number of book-entry
settlements and by limiting the number of physical deliveries that occur, the rule will enhance the efficiency of
the clearance and settlement of municipal securities. As a consequence, a safer environment in which to facilitate
transactions in municipal securities will exist. The proposed rule change also facilitates the conversion to T+3
settlement of municipal securities and thus promotes cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,
clearing, and settling municipal securities.
The Commission believes that the limited exemption for issues under $1 million in par value adequately addresses
the concerns of the commenters. The PSA noted that almost 20% of the new issues in 1992 would have been eligible for the
small issue exemption. The Commission believes that it is important that the vast majority of securities be made depository
eligible. There are concerns, however, that underwriters of smaller issues may not be prepared for book-entry distribution.
The Commission believes that the temporary exemption will give underwriters of smaller issues an opportunity to
adapt to book-entry distribution while establishing a definite date by which smaller issues must be made depository
eligible.
The Commission also agrees with the MSRB's determination not to exempt municipal leases, municipal notes, and municipal
bonds sold to nondepository participants. The Commission believes that every effort should be made to make as many
types of municipal securities depository eligible as practicable.


IV. Conclusion


On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act
and particularly with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
It is therefore ordered, pursaunt to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSRB-94-13)
be, and hereby is, approved and will become effective February 7, 1995.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to its Rule 229 Governing Execution of PACE Orders</DOCTITLE>



December 12, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 1, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On December 12, 1994, the Exchange filed with the Commission
Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., pursuant to Rule 19b-4 of the Act, proposes to amend the Supplementary
Material section to its Rule 229 respecting the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Automated Communication and Execution
System (``PACE''). The text of the proposed rule change is as follows [new text is italicized; deleted text is bracketed]:



Rule 229

* * * Supplementary Material

* * * Execution of Market Orders



.05 

Subject to Supplementary Material Section .07,

 all round-lot market orders up to 500 shares 

and PRL market orders up to 599 shares


 will be [executed automatically upon entry into the system; provided, however,]

 stopped at the PACE Quote


 

at the time of entry into the system (``Stop Price'') and be subject to a delay of up to 15 seconds from being executed
in order to receive an opportunity for price improvement. If such market order is not executed within the 15 second
window, the order will be automatically executed at the Stop Price. If the PACE Quote at the time of order entry into
the system reflects a 1/8 point spread between the best bid and offer, that order will be executed immediately without
the 15 second delay. Subject to these procedures,

 the specialist may voluntarily agree to execute round-lot [and PRL] market orders of a size greater than 500 shares


and PRL market orders of a size greater than 599 shares

 [automatically] upon entry into the system.






* * * * *



.07(a) Member organizations which enter market orders (round-lots up to 500 shares and PRL's up to 599 shares)
after the opening may elect to have such orders executed (i) [automatically on the PACE Quote] 

in accordance with the procedures set forth in Supplementary Material Section .05

 or, (ii) if such execution price would be outside the New York market high-low range for the day manually at or within
the New York market high-low range of the day.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide for an enhancement to PACE by providing Phlx specialists the opportunity
to effect price improvement for market orders in securities sent through PACE when the spread between the PACE Quote,
which reflects the consolidated national best bid and offer, exceeds 1/8 point in any PACE eligible security. The
proposed rule change provides for an automatic stop of such orders and a fifteen second execution delay, allowing
a Phlx specialist to manually provide for price improvement equal to or better than the stock price.
 Specifically, all round-lot market orders of up to 500 shares and all combined round-lot and odd-lot orders of up to
599 shares will be stopped at the PACE Quote at the time of entry into PACE (stopped at the best bid for sell orders; at
the best ask for buy orders) and shall be subject to a delay of up to fifteen seconds from being executed in order to provide
an opportunity for price improvement by the Phlx specialist. If a particular market order is not executed within fifteen
seconds, the order will be automatically executed by the system at the stop price. If the PACE Quote at the time of order
entry reflects a spread between the best bid and offer of 1/8 point, PACE market orders shall be system executed immediately.

2. Statutory Basis





The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 in general and Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public interest.
Additionally, the proposed system enhancement and rule change are consistent with the mandate of Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(iv)
of the Act respecting ``[t]he practicability of brokers executing investors' orders in the best market.''



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition





The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.




C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others





The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action





Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:



(A) By Order approve the proposed rule change, or

<DOCTITLE>Shipping Coordinating Committee, Subcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment and Associated Bodies; Notice of Meeting
</DOCTITLE>



The Shipping Coordinating Committee (SCC) will conduct an open meeting at 9:30 AM on Friday, January 6, 1995, in Room
2415, at U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001. The purpose of the
meeting is to finalize preparations for the Thirty-eighth session of the Subcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment
(DE 38) and associated bodies of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which is scheduled for January 23-27,
1995, at the IMO Headquarters in London. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the papers received and the draft U.S.
positions for DE 38.
Among other things, the items of particular interest are:
a. Safety of passenger submersible craft;
b. Development of safety standards for combined pusher tug-barges;
c. Guidelines for safe ocean towing;
d. Guidelines for the design and operation of passenger ships to the needs of elderly and disabled persons;
e. Use of compressed air systems for buoyancy;
f. Ventilation of vehicle decks during loading and unloading;
g. Matters related to the prevention of oil pollution;
h. Matters relating to ship structures, including hull stress monitoring devices, corrosion protection for ballast
tanks, and access to tank and ballast space structures;
i. Structural aspects of the on board use of composite materials;
j. Requirements for ships intended for polar waters;
k. Revision of the Code of Safety for Diving Systems;
l. Review of existing ships' safety standards; and
m. Guidelines on standard calculation methods for anchor positioning systems for Mobile Offshore Drilling Units
(MODUs).
The IMO Subcommittees work to develop international agreements, guidelines, and standards for the marine industry.
In most cases, these international agreements, guidelines, and standards form the basis for national standards/regulations
and class society rules. The U.S. Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Working Group supports the U.S. Representative to the
IMO Subcommittee in developing the U.S. position on those issues raised at the IMO Subcommittee meetings. Because
of the impact on domestic regulations through development of these international guidelines, standards, and regulations,
the U.S. SOLAS Working Group serves as an excellent forum for the U.S. maritime industry to express their ideas. All
shipping companies, shipyards, design firms, naval architects, marine engineers, and consultants are encouraged
to send representatives to participate in the development of U.S. positions on those issues affecting your maritime
industry and remain abreast of all activities ongoing within the IMO.
Members of the public may attend this meeting up to the seating capacity of the room. Interested persons may seek information
by writing: CDR Jim Stamm, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Commandant (G-MTH), Room 1218, 2100 Second Street
SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001 or by calling: (202) 267-2206.

<DOCTITLE>Shipping Coordinating Committee, Subcommittee for the Prevention of Marine Pollution; Notice of Meeting </DOCTITLE>



The Subcommittee for the Prevention of Marine Pollution (SPMP), a subcommittee of the Shipping Coordinating Committee,
will conduct an open meeting on January 12, 1995, 9:30 AM in Room 2415 of U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second
Street SW., Washington, D.C.
The purpose of this meeting will be to report on the thirty-sixth session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee
(MEPC 36) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) held from October 31-November 4, 1994. The Coast
Guard has held similar meetings prior to MEPC sessions. To facilitate public involvement and provide additional
time for the public to review issues addressed at MEPC sessions, the Coast Guard feels an additional public meeting
shortly after an MEPC session is needed. The U.S. delegation to MEPC 36 will report on the activities of the session.
The major items for discussion will be the following:
a. Prevention of oil pollution. Work progress on the guidelines for implementation of Regulations 13F and 13G to Annex
I of The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78). This includes guidelines
for structural and operational requirements for existing ships, equivalencies for double-hulls for new ships,
and guidelines for enhanced inspections.
b. Implementation of the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation (OPRC).
An IMO working group addressed topics such as guidelines for the use and application of dispersants and the redraft
of the contingency planning portion of the IMO Oil Pollution Manual.
c. Follow-up action to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). An MEPC working group
examined IMO's role in implementation of UNCED and discussed the results of a correspondence group on use of the precautionary
principle.
d. Unwanted aquatic organisms in ballast water. A working group discussed a possible technical annex to MARPOL 73/78
to prevent the introduction of exotic species through discharge of ballast water.
e. Enforcement of Pollution Conventions. A working group considered refuse recordkeeping amendments to Annex V
of MARPOL 73/78 proposed by the United States.
f. The future work program of the U.S. in preparation for MEPC 37 scheduled for September, 1995.
Members of the public may attend the meeting up to the seating capacity of the room.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Order Adjusting International Cargo Rate Flexibility Level </DOCTITLE>



Policy Statement PS-109, implemented by Regulation ER-1322 of the Civil Aeronautics Board and adopted
by the Department, established geographic zones of cargo pricing flexibility within which certain cargo rate tariffs
filed by carriers would be subject to suspension only in extraordinary circumstances. 

The Standard Foreign Rate Level (SFRL) for a particular market is the rate in effect on April 1, 1982, adjusted for the
cost experience of the carriers in the applicable ratemaking entity. The first adjustment was effective April 1,
1983. By Order 94-10-8, the Department established the currently effective SFRL adjustments. 

In establishing the SFRL for the two-month period beginning December 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based
on the year ended September 30, 1994 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced
monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. 

By Order 94-12-16 cargo rates may be adjusted by the following adjustment factors over the April 1, 1982
level: 




Atlantic 
1.1665 

Western Hemisphere 
1.1136 

Pacific 
1.3878

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Order Adjusting the Standard Foreign Fare Level Index </DOCTITLE>



Section 41509(e) of Title 49 of the United States Code requires that the Department, as successor to the Civil Aeronautics
Board, establish a Standard Foreign Fare Level (SFFL) by adjusting the SFFL base periodically by percentage changes
in actual operating costs per available seat-mile (ASM). Order 80-2-69 established the first interim
SFFL, and Order 94-10-7 established the currently effective two-month SFFL applicable through November
30, 1994. 

In establishing the SFFL for the two-month period beginning December 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based
on the year ended September 30, 1994 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced
monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. 

By Order 94-12-15 fares may be increased by the following adjustment factors over the October 1979 level:





Atlantic 
1.3877 

Latin America 
1.4122 

Pacific 
1.7834 

Canada

Autokraft Ltd; Receipt of Application for Renewal of 
Temporary Exemption From Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 



Autokraft Limited of Weybridge, Surrey, England, has applied for a renewal of NHTSA Exemption No. 92-6, exempting
its AC MkIV until January 1, 1995, from compliance with paragraph S4.1.4 of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
No. 208 

Occupant Crash Protection

. The basis of the application is that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship to a manufacturer that
has tried to comply with the standard in good faith. 
Notice of receipt of the application is published in accordance with agency regulations on the subject (49 CFR Part
555) and does not represent any judgment of the agency on the merits of the application. 
Autokraft was granted NHTSA Exemption No. 92-6 on December 21, 1992 (57 FR 60563). The reader is referred to that
notice for further information about the company and its initial compliance efforts. The exemption from S4.1.4 of
Standard No. 208 will expire on January 1, 1995. Because the application for renewal of the exemption was filed ``not
later than 60 days before the termination date'' (in this instance, October 27, 1994), the termination date is stayed
until the Administrator has acted upon the application (49 CFR 555.8(e)). 
The applicant seeks a further two-year exemption for its AC Mark IV passenger car, of which it has produced 15 in the
year preceding the filing of its application. Although the company had projected sales of 150 units in the United States
in the years 1992-94, in fact, there have been only seven sales. According to its application, Autokraft ``has
continued the process of researching and developing the installation of a driver and passenger side airbag system''
but ``we have been unable to achieve the fitting of a suitable system mainly due to the chassis design being based upon
a classic 1960's design and not easily adaptable to suit air bag installation.'' The delay is also due to ``the project
having insufficient funds generated by sales and available for completing the development.'' 
Autokraft has concluded that the adaptation of an existing automatic restraint system is the only viable alternative.
Its continuation of compliance efforts has given it ``significant knowledge into the areas of vehicle modification,
computer simulation, design rough road testing and low, medium and high speed crash testing.'' Complicating its
efforts is the need to use a different engine and transmission after October 1, 1995, and the possible effect that this
will have upon compliance. It estimates the cost to achieve conformance would be $550,000, achievable by spreading
these costs during the exemption period. Autokraft reports losses totalling 3,308,243 Pounds Sterling (approximately
$5,624,000 at a rate of $1.70/1) for the years 1992-93, and projects a further loss for 1994. 
The company argues that an exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of motor vehicle
safety because it meets all applicable EEC standards, and all U.S. Federal motor vehicle safety standards with the
exception of the automatic restraint requirements of Standard No. 208 (its 3-point driver and passenger restraints
meet the previous requirements). The production of the car makes available to the public ``at a realistic price''
a replica of the original AC Cobra vehicle produced from the original AC Cobra tooling, manufactured during the 1960's
predominantly for the American market. Autokraft is in the process of finalizing a U.S. distribution agreement and
will show the car at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January 1995. 
The applicant believes that it will comply with Standard No. 208 six months before January 1, 1997, when the 2-year
extension of its exemption that it has requested would expire. 
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the application described above. Comments should refer to Docket
No. 92-50; Notice 3, and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
room 5109, 400 Seventh St. SW, Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. 
All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated below will be considered,
and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent
possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Notice of final action on the petition will
be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below. 
Comment closing date: January 18, 1995.

<DOCTITLE>General Motors Corporation; Decision That </DOCTITLE>
Noncompliance With Standard No. 108 is Inconsequential to Safety 

 


General Motors Corporation (GM) of Warren, Michigan, determined that some of its vehicles failed to comply with 49
CFR 571.108, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 108, ``Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated
Equipment,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.''
GM also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 - ``Motor Vehicle
Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published on July 29, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR
38660). This notice grants the application. 
Figure 10 of FMVSS No. 108, referenced at S5.1.1.27(a)(3), lists the photometric requirements for center high-mounted
stop lamps (CHMSLs). GM produced two different vehicle populations which do not meet the photometric requirements
of Figure 10. The first population of vehicles, approximately 23,695 Cadillac Deville and Deville Concours produced
between the start of the 1994 model year and November 19, 1993, had their CHMSLs ``framed'' in the rear window by a 27
mm high opening in the blackout paint at the lower edge of the rear window. A vertical shift in the installed position
of the rear window, compounded by build variation, caused the painted frame around the CHMSL on each of these vehicles
to obscure the photometric performance at the 5D line. 
The second population of vehicles, approximately 65,403 Cadillac Deville and Deville Concours produced between
November 19, 1993, and May 4, 1994, has a narrower painted ``frame'' around the CHMSL in the rear window. The painted
frame width was reduced due to an engineering change by 5 mm to a width of 22 mm. The shift in installed position and build
variation noted above obscured the 5D line on some of these vehicles. Other vehicles within this second population
had the 10U line obscured as a result of build variation. In no case were both the 5D and 10U lines obscured. 
GM supported its application for inconsequential noncompliance as discussed below. GM also submitted diagrams
and tables in support which are available for review in the NHTSA docket. According to GM: 



GM performed a dimensional analysis on a 51-vehicle sample to determine where the paint opening on the rear glass was
in relation to the CHMSL. (Note that no CHMSL could be obscured at both the top and bottom by the paint line.) For those
vehicles with the CHMSL obscured at the bottom of the lamp, the analysis, which approximates a normal distribution,
indicated that 1.5 percent of the entire population of vehicles, or approximately 1,336 vehicles, could experience
sufficient obscuration to render the vehicles out of compliance with FMVSS 108, with a 4.6 mm worst case infringement
at the bottom of the CHMSL. However, a photometric test conducted on a CHMSL with a 4.6 mm mask at the bottom of the lamp
established that for the test points that fell on and below horizontal, i.e., for the points on the H and 5D lines, photometric
output exceeded FMVSS 108 requirements by an average of 75 percent. * * * Even on the 5D line, all five
test points were within 20 percent of FMVSS 108, with the worst performance at 5D-5R, where the tested value was
23.0 candela, or 82 percent of the 25.0 candela requirement. 
As for those vehicles with the CHMSL obscured at the top of the lamp, the sample suggests that 15 percent of the second
population described above, or 9,810 vehicles, could be obscured to the point that they would fail to comply with FMVSS
108, with a worst case infringement at the top of the CHMSL of 4.5 mm. However, a photometric test on a CHMSL with a 4.5
mm mask at the top of the lamp demonstrated that while test values on the 10U line fall below required levels, the lamp
provides approximately 75 percent more light output above horizontal (at the 5U and 10U lines combined) than required
by FMVSS 108. (Photometric output of the obscured lamp as a whole approximated 33 percent more than FMVSS 108 requirements.)
* * *
To determine the extent of the noncompliance for those vehicles obscured at the top of the CHMSL, GM plotted data from
a series of photometric tests of 10U-V (the worst performing test point), with varying degrees of obscuration, against
performance to the FMVSS 108 requirement. The result approximates a linear function of obscuration versus photometric
output, and suggests that subject CHMSLs obscured less than 3.07 mm will fall within 20 percent of the values listed
in FMVSS 108 * * *. Applying the distribution determined from GM's 51-vehicle sample to that, approximately
76 percent, or 7,456 of the 9,810 vehicles described above, will provide photometric output within 20 percent of the
FMVSS 108 requirements at 10U. 
As acknowledged in NHTSA's notices granting other similar Petitions for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance,
a change in luminous intensity of approximately 25 percent is required before the human eye can detect a difference
between two lamps. (See, e.g., Notice granting Petition by Subaru of America (56 Fed. Reg. 59971); and Notice granting
Petition by Hella, Inc. (55 Fed. Reg. 37601, at 37602).) Given this, the 7,456 vehicles obscured less than 3.07 mm at
the top of the CHMSL, as well as the 1,336 vehicles obscured at the bottom of the lamp, do not compromise motor vehicle
safety since the noncompliance is imperceptible to the naked eye and the overall light at the outer zones (H & 5D;
5U & 10U) exceeds the FMVSS requirements. 
Although the degradation in light output for the 2,354 remaining vehicles would likely be discernible in a subjective
side-by-side comparison with a conforming lamp, visible light is still emitted at the 10U line. Moreover, GM's photometric
analysis indicates that even with a worst case obscuration of the 10U line, the 16 candela required light output at
10U-V is supplied at 8U-V. Given that and the location of the CHMSL on the subject vehicles, these CHMSLs perform their
intended function in a manner virtually indistinguishable from CHMSLs on other vehicles that fully comply with FMVSS
108, as demonstrated below.

The specified range of required photometric output for CHMSLs from 10U to 5D was developed from SAE J186a and is presumably
intended to allow manufacturers latitude in locating CHMSLs for the myriad of vehicle designs, while assuring that
sufficient light is available to signal drivers of following vehicles. For example, the 10U photometric angle helps
to assure that drivers of large vehicles (such as medium and heavy duty trucks), perceive a preceding vehicle's CHMSL
signal, regardless of the size of that vehicle or the CHMSL's mounting location. 



 However, the Cadillac CHMSL is mounted relatively high in relation to other passenger vehicles on the road, and is
located in the passenger compartment, not on the deck lid. Therefore, the light emitted from the Cadillac CHMSL at
the upward-most photometric angles is not as critical as light at those same angles emitted from vehicles with CHMSLs
located rearward and closer to the ground. 


 To illustrate this point, GM compared the Cadillac CHMSL to the CHMSL on the Mazda Miata. The Miata sits comparatively
low to the ground, and its CHMSL is mounted low on the deck lid. After determining that the 16 candela photometric output
required by FMVSS 108 at 10U-V is provided by the Cadillac CHMSL with a worst case intrusion at 8U, GM overlaid the mounting
location and 10U line of the Mazda Miata on a drawing of the Cadillac CHMSL and 8U line, placing the rear of the vehicles
at the same location *
 9*
 9*. The result shows that the 8U and 10U lines cross 37.4 feet behind the vehicles and 9.3 feet above the ground;
until that point, the Cadillac CHMSL provides more light to the extreme up positions than does the fully compliant
Miata CHMSL. 


 GM then overlaid on the drawing of the Cadillac and Miata CHMSLs the average eye ellipse location for heavy duty trucks
(cab over) and medium duty trucks, which are 7.7 feet and 6.8 feet from ground, respectively *
 9*
 9*. The fact that these eye-ellipse locations fall well below the 9.3 feet intersection point of the Cadillac
CHMSL 8U line and the Miata CHMSL 10U line demonstrates that the Cadillac CHMSL provides sufficient usable light to
all following drivers. 


 That is, because GM designed the subject vehicles with a high and forward CHMSL mounting location, drivers sitting
at the highest positions from the road will see the photometric output intended by the Standard for the upward-most
angles, regardless of (worst case) obscuration of the lamp. The Cadillac CHMSL actually provides a greater area of
visible light than a vehicle with a fully compliant lamp that is mounted lower and rearward. 


 There are vehicles with fully compliant CHMSLs, at mounting locations approximating that of the Cadillac, that cast
more light in the upper extreme areas behind the vehicle. However, *
 9*
 9* a compliant CHMSL (mounted at the same location as the Cadillac CHMSL) will provide only an additional triangular
area six feet in length and eleven inches high of potentially usable light, starting 20 feet behind the vehicle. This
small area is only visible to drivers of the largest vehicles. Given that and negligible decrease of light emitted
by the Cadillac CHMSL, GM believes that the Cadillac CHMSL will perform its intended function effectively identical
to fully compliant CHMSLs mounted at the same location. Furthermore, as demonstrated above, the Cadillac CHMSL provides
more light at the extreme up angles than other fully compliant CHMSLs mounted lower and rearward. These factors, together
with the small number of Cadillacs involved, support GM's belief that the CHMSLs at issue here will not have an adverse
affect on motor vehicle safety. 


 The CHMSLs otherwise meet all FMVSS 108 requirements, and the photometric output of the stop lamps, which are supplemented
by the CHMSL, far exceeds FMVSS 108 minimum requirements. 


 GM is not aware of any accidents, injuries, owner complaints or field reports related to this issue. 


 General Motors believes that the noncompliance that results from a small obstruction of the CHMSL by blackout paint
on the rear window is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. In consideration of the foregoing, General
Motors petitions that it be exempted from the recall and remedy provisions of the Act for this specific noncompliance
with FMVSS 108. 


 No comments were received on the application.

 


 
In presenting its arguments, GM has separated its noncomplying vehicles into two categories, those in which
