</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric
Company (GE) CF6-45/-50 series turbofan engines. This proposal would require a reduction of the low cycle fatigue
(LCF) retirement lives for certain high pressure turbine rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disks, and would provide a drawdown
schedule for those affected parts with reduced LCF retirement lives. This proposal is prompted by the results of a
refined life analysis performed by the manufacturer which revealed minimum calculated LCF lives significantly
lower than published LCF retirement lives. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent a LCF failure
of the HPTR stage 2 disk, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft.

Availability of NPRMs 


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant
Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-ANE-37, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA
01803-5299. 


Discussion 


This proposed airworthiness directive (AD) is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6-45/-50 series
turbofan engines. A study performed by the manufacturer using updated life analyses for the high pressure turbine
rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disk has revealed minimum calculated low cycle fatigue (LCF) lives which are significantly lower
than published LCF retirement lives. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a LCF failure of the HPTR stage
2 disk, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. 
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6-50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72-1069,
dated September 12, 1994, that describes a reduction in the published LCF retirement lives for affected HPTR stage
2 disks, and an FAA-approved rework procedure for the affected disks to increase the FAA-approved LCF retirement
life to 8,750 or 9,700 cycles since new (CSN), depending on the CSN of the disk when the rework is performed. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design,
the proposed AD would require a reduction of the published LCF retirement lives for certain HPTR stage 2 disks, and
would provide a drawdown schedule for those affected disks with reduced LCF retirement lives. If the FAA-approved
rework is accomplished, the LCF retirement life may be increased to 8,750 or 9,700 cycles, depending on the 
CSN of the disk when the rework is performed. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the
service bulletin described previously. 
The FAA estimates that 280 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that
it would take approximately 194 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $16,383 per engine. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,574,840. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Fokker Model F28
Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require an inspection to detect the presence of a drain hole in certain
mounting frames of the auxiliary power unit (APU). If a drain hole is present, the proposed AD would also require an
inspection to detect corrosion of the mounting frame, and eventual replacement of the mounting frame. This proposal
is prompted by a report indicating that corrosion was found on a number of mounting frames of the APU. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent such corrosion, which could render the APU inoperative and may lead to a potential
fire hazard.

Discussion 



The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that corrosion
has been found on a number of mounting frames, having part number (P/N) D67050-407, of the auxiliary power unit
(APU). Investigation revealed that the existing design of the drain hole in frame member M allows the accumulation
of moisture and corrosion on the mounting frame of the APU. Such corrosion could render the APU inoperative and may
lead to a potential fire hazard. 

Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100-49-022, dated August 27, 1992, which describes procedures
for: 

1. Performing a one-time detailed visual inspection to detect the presence of a drain hole in frame member M of the mounting
frames, having part number (P/N) D67050-407, of the APU; 

2. If a drain hole is present, performing a detailed visual inspection to detect corrosion on the mounting frame of
the APU; and 

3. Replacing the mounting frame with a new mounting frame. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and
issued Netherlands airworthiness directive (BLA) 92-103, dated October 5, 1992, in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to detect the presence
of a drain hole in frame member M of certain mounting frames of the APU. If a drain hole is present, the proposed AD would
also require an inspection to detect corrosion of the mounting frame; and eventual replacement of the mounting frame
with a new mounting frame. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin
described previously. 

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 

The FAA estimates that 119 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
13 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $92,820, or $780
per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
(AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. This proposal would 
require installation of modified engine de-ice timers, modification of the electrical wiring 
for the duct heat of the engine air intake, and installation of a time delay for the de-ice 
system in the air intake duct of the right engine. This proposal would also require 
associated revisions to the Airplane Flight Manual. This proposal is prompted by reports 
of ice that accreted in the engine air intake ducts and was ingested into the engine; this 
resulted in engine power rollback (loss of engine power). The actions specified by the 
proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of multiple engine power during flight in icing

Discussion 


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. The CAA advises that probable
ingestion of accreted ice, shed from the inner surfaces of the engine air intake ducts, has resulted in engine power
rollbacks (loss of engine power) during flight in icing conditions. Five reports have been received: three reports
of power rollback on two engines simultaneously, and two reports of power rollback on one engine. Ingestion of accreted
ice, if not prevented, could result in multiple engine power rollback during flight in freezing precipitation conditions.

Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP-30-39-30146A (Modification 30146A), dated July 29,
1994, which describes procedures for installing modified de-ice timers for the left and right engines. The modified
de-ice timers will provide additional electric power directly to the engine air intake flange heater. This additional
electric load requires revision of electric load shedding procedures in the event of electrical system failure.
These procedures are included in the Jetstream Aircraft ATP Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), Temporary Revision T/41,
Issue 1, dated November 15, 1994. 
Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP-30-37-30143A (Modification 30143A), dated August
1, 1994, and Revision 1, dated September 5, 1994, which describe procedures for installation of modified electrical
wiring for flexible ducts and lips of the engine air intake. This modification automates turning on the de-ice heaters
in the flexible duct of the engine air intake when the lip heat is on. The modification continues to allow pilots to select
the de-ice systems of the engine air intake manually, via the ``All On'' switch of the anti-ice system. 
The CAA classified these service bulletins as mandatory, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these
airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP-30-30-35285A, dated July 15, 
1994, which describes procedures for installation of a system that automates a 20-second delay between the time that
the left engine intake de-ice systems are turned on and the time that the right engine intake de-ice systems are turned
on. This modification also reduces pilot workload by automatically turning on the engine de-ice system at an interval
20 seconds apart for the left and right engines when the engine intake de-ice is selected to ``on.'' The automated 20-second
time delay ensures that the de-ice system for the left and right engine intakes will be turned on in such a way as to prevent
simultaneous rollbacks of the engines in icing conditions. The CAA has not classified this service bulletin as mandatory.
However, the FAA has determined that the pilot could easily neglect to heed the necessary 20-second delay if manually
turning on the second flexible duct de-ice system; this could cause accumulated ice in the air intake ducts of both
engines to dislodge simultaneously and be ingested into the engines, which then could result in rollback of both engines
at the same time. In light of this, the FAA considers that the modification described in this service bulletin is necessary.

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type 
certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness
agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of
the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type
design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require installation of new de-ice timers and an associated
revision to the AFM; installation of a system that automates a 20-second delay between turning on the left engine intake
de-ice system and turning on the right engine intake de-ice system; and installation of modified electrical wiring
for the flexible ducts and lips of the engine air intake. These actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletins described previously. 

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 

The FAA estimates that 10 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
72 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $43,200, or $4,320 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
(AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9, DC-9-80, and C-9 
(Military) series airplanes, and Model MD-88 airplanes. This proposal would require 
repetitive replacement of the emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with 
a new switch. This proposal is prompted by a report of heavy smoke in the cockpit 
coming from the overhead switch panel on a Model DC-9-81 series airplane. The actions 
specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure replacement of the emergency power 
switch when it has reached its maximum life limit; an emergency power switch that is 
not replaced could fail and lead to a short in the electrical circuit, which could result in a 
fire in the overhead switch panel and smoke in the cockpit.

Availability of NPRMs 


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA,

No. 94-NM-194-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056. 


Discussion 


The FAA has received a report of heavy smoke in the cockpit coming from the 
overhead switch panel on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9-81 (MD-81) series airplane. 
Investigation revealed that the fire had originated in the area of the emergency power 
switch in the overhead switch panel. Further investigation, conducted by Mason Electric 
Company (the manufacturer of the emergency power switch), revealed that the 
emergency power switch, upon exceeding 10,000 switch cycles (off-to-on-to-off) can fail 
due to wear or overstress. If not replaced in a timely manner, the emergency power 
switch could fail and lead to a short in the electrical circuit, which could result in a fire in 
the overhead switch panel and smoke in the cockpit. 
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Service Bulletin 
24-150, dated March 28, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitively replacing the 
emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with a new switch at regular 
intervals. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitively 
replacing the emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with a new switch at 
regular intervals. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with 
the service bulletin described previously. 
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA 
points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally 
subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a 
way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA 
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the 
paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this 
notice to clarify this requirement. 
There are approximately 1,990 Model DC-9, DC-9-80, and C-9 (Military) series 
airplanes and Model MD-88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The 
FAA estimates that 992 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, 
that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed 
actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost 
approximately $1,434 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,541,568, or $1,554 per airplane, per 
replacement cycle. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules

Discussion 



The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), which is the 
airworthiness authority for Germany, recently notified 
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on Schempp-Hirth Cirrus and Cirrus VTC sailplanes. The LBA 
advises that the coupling balls on the airbrake 
actuating lever located inside the fuselage have broken 
at the threaded end on several of the above referenced 
sailplanes. This condition, if not detected and 
corrected, could result in sailplane controllability 
problems. 

Schempp-Hirth has issued Technical Note 265-10, 
dated November 5, 1992, which specifies procedures for 
modifying the airbrake actuating lever and replacing 
the airbrake system coupling balls. The LBA 
classified this technical note as urgent in order to 
assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes 
in Germany.

This airplane model is manufactured in Germany and 
is type certificated for operation in the United States 
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable 
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this 
bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LBA has kept the 
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA 
has examined the findings of the LBA, reviewed all 
available information, and determined that AD action is 
necessary for products of this type design that are 
certificated for operation in the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other Schempp-Hirth 
Cirrus and Cirrus VTC sailplanes of the same type 
design, the proposed AD would require modifying the 
airbrake actuating lever and replacing the airbrake 
system coupling balls. The proposed actions would be 
accomplished in accordance with the service information 
referenced above. 

The FAA estimates that 21 sailplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 1 workhour per sailplane to 
accomplish the proposed action, and that the average 
labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost 
approximately $25 per airplane. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on 
U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,785. This figure 
is based on the assumption that no affected sailplane 
owner/operator has accomplished the proposed 
modification and replacement. The FAA believes that 
several of the 21 affected sailplane owners/operators 
have already accomplished the proposed action, which 
would reduce the FAA's proposed cost impact upon the 
public. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in 
the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by

Schedules of Controlled Substances; Proposed Placement of 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine Into Schedule
I



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice of proposed rulemaking is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) to place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA) into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances
Act (CSA). This proposed action by the DEA Deputy Administrator is based on data gathered and reviewed by the DEA. If
finalized, this proposed action would impose the regulatory control mechanisms and criminal sanctions of Schedule
I on the manufacture, distribution, and possession of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On January 6, 1994, the Acting Administrator of the DEA published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 671) amending  1308.11(g) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA
into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). This final rule, which
became effective on the date of publication, was based on findings by the Acting Administrator that the temporary
scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Section 201(h)(2)
of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2)) requires that the temporary scheduling of a substance expires at the end of one year
from the effective date of the order. However, if proceedings to schedule a substance pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1)
have been initiated and are pending, the temporary scheduling of a substance may be extended for up to six months. Under
this provision, the temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA which would expire on January 6, 1995, may be extended
to July 6, 1995. This extension is being ordered by the DEA Deputy Administrator in a separate action.




The DEA has gathered and reviewed the available information regarding the trafficking, actual abuse and the relative
potential for abuse for 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA. The Deputy Administrator has submitted this data to the Assistant Secretary
for Health, Department of Health and Human Services. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Deputy Administrator
also requested a scientific and medical evaluation and a scheduling recommendation for 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA from
the Assistant Secretary for Health.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified the DEA that there are no exemptions or approvals in effect under
Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA. A search of the scientific and medical
literature revealed no indications of current medical use of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA in the United States.

4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA is structurally similar to the Schedule I phenylisopropylamine hallucinogens, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
(DOB). Like DOM and DOB, 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA displays high affinity for central serotonin receptors and is capable
of substituting for DOM or DOB in drug discrimination studies conducted in rats. These data suggest that 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA
is a psychoactive substance capable of producing effects similar, though not identical, to DOM and DOB. Data from
human studies indicate that 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA is orally active at 0.1-0.2 mg/kg producing an intoxication
with considerable euphoria and sensory enhancement which lasts for 6 to 8 hours. Higher doses have been reported to
produce intense and frightening hallucinations.

The DEA first encountered 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA in 1979. Since that time, several exhibits of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA have
been analyzed by Federal and state forensic laboratories in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois,
Iowa, Kentucky, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas. Clandestine laboratories producing 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA were seized
in California in 1986 and 1994 and in Arizona in 1992. It has been represented as 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine
(MDMA) and has been sold in sugar cubes as LSD. Recently, 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA has been promoted as an aphrodisiac and
distributed under the product name of Nexus. DEA has seized several thousand dosage units of this product.

The Deputy Administrator, based on the information gathered and reviewed by his staff and after consideration of
the factors in 21 U.S.C. 811(c), believes that sufficient data exist to propose and to support that 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA
be placed into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a). The specific findings required pursuant to 21 U.S.C.
811 and 812 for a substance to be placed into Schedule I are as follows:

(1) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.

(2) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

(3) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.

Before issuing a final rule in this matter, the DEA Deputy Administrator will take into consideration the scientific
and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b). The Deputy Administrator will also consider relevant comments from other concerned
parties. 

Interested persons are invited to submit their comments, objections, or requests for a hearing in writing with regard
to this proposal. Requests for a hearing should state with particularity the issues concerning which the person desires
to be heard. All correspondence regarding this matter should be submitted to the Deputy Administrator, Drug Enforcement
Administration, Washington, D.C. 20537, Attention: DEA Federal Register Representative. In the event that comments,
objections, or requests for a hearing raise one or more issues which the Deputy Administrator finds warrants a hearing,
the Deputy Administrator shall order a public hearing by notice in the 

Federal Register

, summarizing the issues to be heard and setting the time for the hearing. 

The Deputy Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that proposed placement of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA into Schedule
I of the CSA will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This action involves the control of a substance with no currently accepted medical
use in the United States. 

This proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866
of September 30, 1993. Drug scheduling matters are not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
pursuant to provisions of E.O. 12866, Section 3(d)(1). 

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined
that this proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

 Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of meeting; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard announces an open meeting to hear the public's opinions on how best to implement amendments contained
in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) that relate to the statutory obligation of certain U.S. and foreign flag vessels
to report to the Coast Guard specific ``marine casualties.'' Following the public meeting, the Coast Guard will decide
whether to propose changes to existing regulations, to propose new regulations, or to implement the statutory changes
through non-regulatory means.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Current Coast Guard regulations in part 4 of title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) meet the requirements
of 46 U.S.C. 6101 for reporting of the following marine casualties: (1) Death of an individual; (2) serious injury
to an individual; (3) material loss of property; and (4) material damage affecting the seaworthiness or efficiency
of the vessel. Part 4 covers submittal of timely reports and investigation by the Coast Guard.



In addition, under the current regulations, U.S. flag vessels are required to report a marine casualty, to the Coast
Guard, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the casualty occurs. However, current Coast Guard regulations do
not require foreign flag vessels to report any marine casualty, such as a non-operational discharge of oil, when operating
in waters beyond the navigable waters of the United States.

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101-380) amends 46 U.S.C. 6101 by adding the term ``significant
harm to the environment'' to the list of reportable marine casualties. The amendment also provides that foreign flag
tank vessels operating in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction beyond the navigable waters of the United States (i.e.,
within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ)) must report to the extent consistent with generally recognized principles
of international law, two categories of marine casualties, those resulting in_(1) material damage affecting the
seaworthiness or efficiency of a vessel; and (2) significant harm to the environment.

The Coast Guard is interested in information and opinions concerning how the Coast Guard should respond to the following
major issues raised by the amendments to 46 U.S.C. 6101 as set forth in OPA 90.

1. Should regulatory changes be made to define and secure reporting of ``significant harm to the environment'' casualties
in the U.S. navigable waters (foreign flag and U.S. flag vessels)? Do the provisions in 46 CFR 4.03-2 (b) and (c)
adequately define incidents which include those having a potential to cause ``significant harm to the environment?''

2. How should the Coast Guard define and implement the requirement for reporting of ``significant harm to the environment''
and ``material damage'' casualties for foreign flag tank vessels in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including
the EEZ, consistent with ``generally recognized principles of international law?'' Do the provisions of 46 CFR 4.05-1(b)
and (c) adequately define incidents which include ``material damage?''

3. How should the Coast Guard impose any reporting requirements for foreign tank vessels in the EEZ_on inbound, outbound,
or transiting vessels?

4. Should any regulations be located as amendments to the existing regulations under 46 U.S.C. 6101 at 46 CFR part 4
or in the pollution prevention regulations implementing international pollution control agreements (33 CFR part
151)?

Attendance at the January 20, 1995 meeting is open to the public. With advance notice, and as time permits, members
of the public may make oral presentations during the meeting. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should call
the number listed in 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 no later than the day before the meeting. Written comments may be submitted prior to, during, or after the meeting.

Monterey Bay Ozone Nonattainment Area; Clean Air Act Section 182(f) Exemption Petition


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is proposing to approve a petition submitted by the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD)
requesting that the Monterey Bay ozone nonattainment area (Monterey Bay Area) be exempted from the requirement to
implement oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). In accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1990 (the Act or CAA), the Monterey Bay Area may be exempted from the NO

X

 reduction requirements where the Administrator determines that the net air quality benefits are greater in the absence
of NO

X

 reductions from the sources concerned or that additional NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to attainment of the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone in areas
outside the ozone transport region (OTR). The MBUAPCD is using three years of ambient monitoring data to demonstrate
that additional NO

X

 reductions in the Monterey Bay Area would not contribute to attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The EPA is proposing to exempt
the Monterey Bay Area from the requirement to implement NO

X

 RACT and the applicable NO

X

 general and transportation conformity requirements. The EPA is proposing approval of this action under provisions
of the CAA regarding plan requirements for nonattainment areas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Applicability


The MBUAPCD submitted the NO

X

 exemption petition to EPA on April 26, 1994. Final approval of the petition exempts the Monterey Bay Area from implementing
the NO

X

 RACT and the NO

X

 general and transportation conformity requirements of the CAA.


Background 


On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified
at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO

X

 emissions are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November 25, 1992, EPA published a NPRM (57 FR 55620) entitled,
``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,'' (the NO

X

 Supplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992, notice should be referred
to for further information on the NO

X

 requirements and is incorporated into this document by reference.

Section 182(f) of the Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO

X

 (``major'' as defined in section 302 and section 182 (c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These requirements are RACT and New Source Review (NSR) for major stationary
sources in certain ozone nonattainment areas.

The RACT requirements for major stationary sources of VOCs are contained in section 182(b)(2), while the NSR requirements
are contained in section 182(a)(2)(C) and other provisions of section 182. Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal
of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by a pre-enactment control technologies
guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document). There were no NO

X

 CTGs issued before enactment, and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO

X

 sources since enactment of the CAA. Section 182(a)(2)(C) requires submittal of NSR rules incorporating the new preconstruction
permitting requirements for new or modified sources. The RACT and NSR rules were required to be submitted by November
15, 1992.
The Monterey Bay Area is classified as a moderate

1

 nonattainment area for ozone; therefore this area is subject to the RACT and NSR requirements cited above and the November
15, 1992 deadline. On April 21, 1993 the State of California was issued a finding of nonsubmittal for MBUAPCD for the
section 182(f) NO

X

 RACT requirements.





The MBUAPCD identified two categories for which major stationary sources of NO

X

 exist and rules are required. These categories apply to NO

X

 emissions from utility power boilers and minerals processing kilns. The MBUAPCD submitted Rule 431, Emissions from
Utility Power Boilers on November 18, 1993, and Rule 435, Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Kilns on September 28, 1994.
The rules were found complete by EPA on December 27, 1993 and October 21, 1994, respectively, and EPA stopped the 18-month
sanctions clock for the NO

X

 RACT requirements on October 21, 1994.

On April 26, 1994, the MBUAPCD submitted a petition to the EPA requesting that the Monterey Bay Area be exempted from
the requirement to implement the NO

X

 RACT measures pursuant to section 182(f) of the CAA. On July 21, 1994, the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments
requested that EPA also grant an exemption from the NO

X

 conformity requirements, also pursuant to section 182(f) of the CAA. The exemption request is based on three years
of clean monitoring data from 1991 through 1993.

Criteria for Evaluation of Section 182(f) Exemption Requests 


The NO

X

 RACT petition was submitted in accordance with the EPA guidance document entitled, 

Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen Oxides Requirements Under Section 182(f)

 issued on December 16, 1993 (exemption guidance). In addition to the exemption guidance, EPA's NO

X

 exemption policy is contained in two memoranda

2

 providing that under section 182(f)(1)(A), an exemption from the NO

X

 requirements may be granted for nonattainment areas outside the OTR if EPA determines that additional reductions
of NO

X

 would not contribute to attainment of the NAAQS for those areas. In cases where a nonattainment area is demonstrating
attainment with three consecutive years of air quality monitoring data, without having implemented the section
182(f) NO

X

 provisions, it is clear that the contribute to attainment test is met, although additional reductions of NO

X

 might contribute to maintenance. 




Thus, a State may submit a petition for a section 182(f) exemption based on air quality monitoring data. The EPA's approval
of the exemption, if warranted, would be granted on a contingent basis (i.e., the exemption would last for only as long
as the area's monitoring data continue to demonstrate attainment). 
EPA's exemption guidance provides that, pursuant to the requirements of section 110(a)(2), States should consider
evidence, such as photochemical grid modeling, which shows that granting the NO

X

 exemption would interfere with attainment or maintenance in downwind areas. The MBUAPCD has not yet implemented
NO

X

 RACT, and at the time of this notice, EPA has not received evidence from the State or any downwind areas that shows that
granting the NO

X

 exemption for the Monterey Bay Area would interfere with attainment or maintenance in downwind areas. 
EPA's conformity rules

3,



4

 also reference the section 182(f) exemption process as a means for exempting affected areas from NO

X

 conformity requirements.

5

 Therefore, ozone nonattainment areas that are granted areawide section 182(f) exemptions will also be exempt from
the NO

X

 conformity requirements. 






EPA Evaluation 


Attainment of the ozone NAAQS is determined based on the expected number of exceedances in a calendar year. Ozone attainment
must rely on three complete, consecutive calendar years of quality-assured air quality monitoring data, collected
in accordance with 40 CFR parts 50 and 58, including Appendices. The method for determining attainment of the ozone
NAAQS is contained in 40 CFR part 50,  50.9 and appendix H to that Section.

6

 appendix H of 40 CFR part 50 explains how to determine when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum
hourly average concentrations above 0.12 ppm ozone is equal to or less than 1. This section also discusses how to account
for incomplete data sets. The EPA ``Guideline for the Interpretation of Ozone Air Quality Standards'' elaborates
on Appendix H. In general, expected exceedances are calculated by averaging actual exceedances at each monitoring
site over a three year period. An area is in attainment of the standard if this average results in expected exceedances
for each monitoring site of 1.0 or less per calendar year.

At the monitoring sites used to evaluate the attainment status of Monterey County, there has been only one exceedance
of the ozone NAAQS. This exceedance was monitored in 1991 at the Pinnacles site. There have been no violations of the
ozone NAAQS during the 1991-1993 period. Based on ambient air monitoring data for the years 1991-1993
(including data from the Pinnacles site which helped form the basis for the Monterey County nonattainment designation
of 1990), it is clear that additional reductions of NO

X

 would not contribute to attainment of the ozone standard. For further information regarding the monitoring sites
data, please see attachments 1 and 2 to the Technical Support Document, dated October 1994. 
The EPA is proposing to approve the Monterey Bay Area section 182(f) NO

X

 RACT exemption request based upon the evidence provided by the MBUAPCD and the MBUAPCD's compliance with the requirements
outlined in the EPA guidance. Continuation of the section 182(f) exemption, once granted, is contingent upon the
continued monitoring and continued attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS in the affected area in accordance
with 40 CFR part 58. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Monterey Bay Area (consistent with the requirements
contained in 40 CFR part 58 and recorded in AIRS), EPA will provide notice in the 

Federal Register

. A determination that the NO

X

 exemption no longer applies would mean that the NO

X

 general and transportation conformity provisions would again be applicable (see 58 FR 63214; 58 FR 62188; 59 FR 31238)
to the affected area. The NO

X

 RACT requirements would also re-apply, although some reasonable time period after the EPA determination may be provided
for sources to meet the RACT limits. EPA expects this time period to be as expeditious as practicable, taking into account
any current and applicable State or Federal regulations. If a nonattainment area is redesignated to attainment of
the ozone NAAQS, NO

X

 RACT is to be implemented as provided for in the EPA-approved maintenance plan. 
This action proposes to exempt the Monterey Bay ozone nonattainment area from implementing the NO

X

 RACT and the applicable general and transportation conformity requirements for NO

X

. The final action on this proposal serves as a final determination that the finding of nonsubmittal for the NO

X

 RACT requirements has been corrected, and that on the effective date of the final action on this proposal, the 24-month
Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock is stopped. The 18-month sanctions clock was stopped on October 21, 1994
when EPA made a completeness determination for the second of two rules submitted to meet the NO

X

 RACT requirements. Upon EPA's final approval of the NO

X

 exemption, MBUAPCD will recind the two NO

X

 RACT rules previously submitted to meet the CAA requirements. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future implementation
plan. Each request for a section 182(f) exemption shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 


Regulatory Process 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule 
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses,
small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over population of less than 50,000.

This exemption action does not create any new requirements, but allows suspension of the indicated requirements
for the life of the exemption. Therefore, because the proposed approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify
that it does not have 
a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship
under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic
reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by January 19, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration 
by the Administrator of this rule does not affect the finality of 
this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend 
the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such
a rule. This action may not be challenged in later proceedings to enforce its requirements. Section 307(b)(2).

(NPDWR) including a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for sulfate. 
There is a potential for an adverse health effect for infants, 
travelers, and new residents in areas that have high sulfate levels 
in their drinking water. The objective of this rule is to ensure 
that sulfate levels in drinking water provided by public water 
systems are reduced below levels of concern. The proposal contains 
alternatives that allow public water systems the flexibility to 
select compliance options appropriate to protect the population 
served.

I. Summary of Today's Action 



Today the Agency is proposing an MCLG of 500 mg/L, an MCL 
of 500 mg/L, and other NPDWR requirements for sulfate. Sulfate is 
a unique contaminant for several reasons. The health effect 
associated with the ingestion of relatively high levels of sulfate 
in drinking water (i.e., ranging from loose stools to diarrhea) is 
acute and temporary, and is expected to last 
approximately two weeks. In addition, the health risk only applies 
to persons not already acclimated to high sulfate-containing water: 
infants, travelers, and new residents. (For the purposes of this 
rule, infants are defined as children up to the age of 12 months.) 
Today's proposed rule is also unique because it affects all public 
water systems, that is, community water systems, traveler non-community water systems, and non-transient, non-community
water 
systems. In the past, only regulations on microbial contaminants 
and nitrate have affected transient, non-community systems. 
EPA decided to defer promulgation of a sulfate standard, 
originally proposed July 25, 1990 (55 FR 30370) in order to 
identify an implementation approach which was tailored to the 
target populations. The approach EPA developed, working in 
cooperation with several States at a 1992 meeting, is innovative, 
and was designed specifically to provide flexibility to smaller 
systems. This approach could reduce compliance costs while still 
providing adequate protection of public health. It provides public 
water systems a means of compliance which is less expensive than 
central treatment, and it affords States flexibility in 
implementing the rule. Under this approach, the State would have 
the authority to allow the public water system (PWS), as one means 
of compliance with the sulfate MCL, to provide ``Alternative Water'' 
and public education/notification to the targeted, sensitive 
population. A PWS authorized to comply under this option would 
choose to supply customers with ``Alternative Water'', defined as 
either bottled water which has been monitored or certified to be in 
compliance with all EPA MCLs, or water treated by point-of-use 
(POU) or point-of-entry (POE) devices. 
In the interest of reducing costs and maximizing 
flexibility, the proposal allows for unique means of compliance. 
Four options are being proposed for public comment. The lead 
option requires provision of alternative water to both transient 
adults (travelers and new residents) and infants. Two variations 
of the lead option require provision of alternative water to 
infants only. These two options differ only in the content of the 
public notification. In one case, only infants are considered at 
risk, and temporary diarrhea is considered as only an inconvenience 
for adults. In the other, both adults and infants are considered 
at risk, but public notification is deemed sufficient protection 
for adults. Because the lead option and its two variations 
represent a significant change in regulatory approach, EPA 
considered another, more conventional option. This fourth option 
would enable systems to seek a variance from the sulfate MCL. As 
a condition of receiving a variance, systems would be required to 
provide alternative water to their target populations, just as in 
the lead option. The only difference is that the relief for small 
systems would be provided through a different statutory mechanism. 
The Agency also considered limiting compliance to central 
treatment, which would be consistent with the approach for other 
contaminants, but which would not provide flexibility for smaller 
systems. 
The Agency expects that approximately 1,500 of the 2,000 
affected systems would choose the lead option (Option 1) if it were 
available to them. The annual cost to those systems is estimated 
to be $7 million. The Agency has conservatively assumed that the 
remaining 500 systems would choose central treatment or 
regionalization in spite of the availability of Option 1. The cost 
to those systems is estimated to be $71 million. Total national 
cost of Option 1, including $8 million for State implementation and 
monitoring costs, is $86 million. If central treatment were the 
only means of compliance with the sulfate rule, the annual national 
cost would be $147 million (household costs ranging from $244 to 
$811). Household costs for Option 1 range from $106 to $287 per 
year, but this is an average of all households in all systems, 
including those choosing central treatment. 
In an effort to reduce the cost of this rule even 
further, the Agency is giving serious consideration to variations 
of Option 1. These variations, described as Options 2 and 3, would 
require public notification/education, but would only require the 
provision of bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs to infants. 
The difference between Options 2 and 3 is that Option 2 would 
target only infants as being at risk from an adverse effect, and 
Option 3 would target both adults and infants, but would propose 
that public notification/education is sufficient protection for 
adults. The Agency sees advantages and disadvantages to these 
alternative options, which are discussed later in this notice. The 
cost for either option would be $16 million, which includes $8 
million for State implementation and monitoring costs. Household 
costs for these two options would be from $2 to $145 per year. 
EPA also considered Option 4, which would achieve the 
same result as Option 1, but with different administrative 
procedures involving a variance from the sulfate MCL. Under Option 
4, the regulation would specify that the conditions for States to 
grant a variance from the sulfate MCL would include the same 
elements described for Option 1, namely public 
notification/education and Alternative Water provisions. These 
elements would be defined as BAT only for the purposes of Section 
1415 of the SDWA. The Agency believes that the unique nature of 
the sulfate health effect warrants a more flexible perspective on 
the implementation of the Act. The Agency recognizes that while the 
transitory nature of the diarrhetic effect of high-sulfate water 
may be uncomfortable and inconvenient for healthy adults, the 
potential risk to infants of diarrhea, as well as the dehydration 
and electrolyte imbalance which may be associated with it, are 
significant and potentially fatal if untreated.

The options in today's proposal would override the general prohibition 
in 40 CFR 141.101 on using bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs and 
point-of-use devices to achieve compliance with an MCL. This override would 
apply only to sulfate because of its unique characteristics. 



II. Background 


A. Statutory Authority 


The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA or ``the Act''), as amended in 1986 
(Pub. L. No. 99-339, 100 Stat. 642), requires EPA to publish ``maximum 
contaminant level goals'' (MCLGs) for contaminants which, in the judgment of 
the Administrator, ``may have any adverse effect on the health of persons and 
which (are) known or anticipated to occur in public water systems'' (Section 
1412(b)(3)(A)). MCLGs are to be set at a level at which ``no known or 
anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allows 
an adequate margin of safety'' (Section 1412(b)(4)). 
Concurrent with EPA publishing an MCLG, which is a non-enforceable 
health goal, it must promulgate a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation 
(NPDWR) which includes either: 

(1) an MCL, or (2) a required treatment technique (Section 1401(1), 
1412(a)(3), and 1412(b)(7)(A)). 

An MCL must be set as close to the MCLG as feasible (Section 
1412(b)(4)). Under the Act, ``feasible'' means ``feasible with the use of the 
best technology, treatment techniques and other means which the Administrator 
finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely 
under laboratory conditions (taking cost into consideration)'' (Section 
1412(b)(5)). In setting MCLs, EPA considers the cost of treatment technology 
to large public water systems (i.e., 

>

1,000,000 people) with relatively clean source water supplies (132 Cong. Rec. S6287 (daily ed., May 21, 1986)).
 Each NPDWR that establishes an MCL must list the best available technology, treatment techniques, and other means
that are feasible for meeting the MCL (Section 1412(b)(6)). NPDWRs include monitoring, analytical and quality assurance
requirements, specifically, ``criteria and procedures, to assure a supply of drinking water which dependably complies
with such maximum contaminant levels * * *.'' (Section 1401(1)(D)). Section 1445 also authorizes
EPA to promulgate monitoring requirements. 





A treatment technique may be required if it is not ``economically or 
technologically feasible'' to ascertain the level of a contaminant (Sections 
1401(1) and 1412(b)(7)(A)). 

Section 1414(c) requires each owner or operator of a PWS to give notice 
to persons served by it of (1) any failure to comply with a maximum 
contaminant level, treatment technique, or testing procedure required by a 
NPDWR; (2) any failure to comply with any monitoring required pursuant to 
section 1445 of the Act; 

(3) the existence of a variance or exemption; and 

(4) any failure to comply with the requirements of any schedule prescribed 
pursuant to a variance or exemption. 

Under the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA, EPA was to complete the 
promulgation of NPDWRs for 83 listed contaminants, including sulfate, by June 
19, 1989. After 1989, an additional 25 contaminants must be regulated every 
three years (section 1412(b)). 

In the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA, Congress required that MCLGs and 
MCLs be proposed and promulgated simultaneously (section 1412(a)(3)). This 
change streamlined development of drinking water standards by combining two 
steps in the regulation development process. Section 1412(a)(2) renamed 
recommended maximum contaminant levels (RMCLs) as maximum contaminant level 
goals (MCLGs). 



B. Regulatory History 



EPA is required by the 1986 amendments to the SDWA to issue a proposed 
and final standard for sulfate. EPA grouped sulfate with 23 other organic 
and inorganic compounds in the ``Phase V'' regulatory package proposal. The 24 
contaminants were among the last of the original list of 83 to be regulated 
by the SDWA. On June 25, 1990 EPA proposed the Phase V regulation, including 
sulfate (published at 55 FR 30370, July 25, 1990). In the notice, EPA 
described the health effects associated with sulfate (see 55 FR 30382-83). The notice stated that the available
scientific information suggests 
that an adverse health effect from ingesting high levels of sulfate is 
diarrhea and associated dehydration. Because local populations usually 
acclimate to high sulfate levels, the impact is primarily on infants, 
transient populations (e.g., business travelers, visitors and vacationers), 
and new residents. In the 1990 notice, EPA proposed alternative levels of 400 
mg/L and 500 mg/L for the MCLG for sulfate.

<TEXT>
 

In the Fall of 1991, as EPA was nearing publication of regulations for 
the 24 Phase V contaminants, it became apparent that the Agency had not 
reached a consensus on how to proceed with the sulfate regulation in light of 
concerns raised by the commenters. Given the high cost of the rule, the 
relatively low risk, and the need to explore alternative regulatory 
approaches targeted at the transient consumer, EPA decided to seek a deferral 
of a final regulatory decision on sulfate. The Agency needed more time to 
resolve issues that included: (1) Whether additional research is needed on 
how long it takes infants to acclimate to water with high sulfate content, 
(2) whether new regulatory approaches were needed for regulating a 
contaminant whose health effect is confined largely to transient populations, 
and (3) whether the Agency should revise its definition of BAT for small 
systems (i.e., what should be considered affordable for the small, transient 
non-community water systems). For the above reasons, the regulation on 
sulfate was deferred. A new schedule has been established in connection with 
litigation brought over the schedule for regulating sulfate. This schedule 
requires EPA to finalize its regulatory action for sulfate by May 1996. 

The secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) for sulfate is 250 mg/L 
and is based on aesthetic effects (i.e., taste and odor). EPA is not 
proposing changes in the SMCL for sulfate, but is requesting public comment 
on the correlation between sulfate concentrations, palatability, and 
consumption of high-sulfate water by the public. 



C. Sulfate General Information 



Sulfate is the divalent anion (SO

4



^2

). It exists in a variety of inorganic compounds and salts formed with metal cations. Sulfate salts with lower molecular
weight alkali metals such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium are very water soluble and are often found in natural
waters. Salts of higher molecular weight metals such as barium, iron or lead have very low water solubility. 

Sulfate is found in soil sediments and rocks, and occurs in the 
environment as a result of both natural processes and human activities. 
Specific data on the total production of all sulfates are not available, but 
production is expected to be thousands of tons per year; the use of sodium 
sulfate alone in 1987 was reported to be 792 tons. Sulfate is used for a 
variety of commercial purposes, including pickle liquor (sulfuric acid) for 
steel and metal industries, and as a reagent in manufacturing of products 
such as copper sulfate (a fungicide/algicide). 

Sulfate may enter surface and ground water as a result of discharge or 
disposal of sulfate-containing wastes. In addition, sulfur oxides produced 
during the combustion of fossil fuels are transformed to sulfuric acid in the 
atmosphere. Through precipitation (i.e., acid rain), sulfuric acid can enter 
surface waters, lowering the pH and raising sulfate levels. 



III. Explanation of Today's Action 



A. Establishment of MCLG for Sulfate 



The MCLG for sulfate is reproposed today at a level of 500 mg/L. In this 
notice, EPA is responding to the public comments submitted in reference to 
the MCLG options contained in the July 1990 proposal. EPA's complete 
responses to the public comments on the previously proposed MCLGs appear in 
the Comment/Response Document that is included in the docket for this 
rulemaking. 

MCLGs are set at concentration levels at which no known or anticipated 
adverse health effects occur, allowing for an adequate margin of safety. The 
process for establishing an MCLG for a contaminant has been described in many 
documents, including the final Phase V rule issued in July 1992 (57 FR 31781-31783).

1. Health Effects



The available information on the health effects of sulfate was fully described in the July 25, 1990 (55 FR 30370) Phase
V proposal. Studies mentioned in that notice are summarized in the Health Criteria Document for Sulfate (US EPA, 1992),
which is available for review and comment in the docket for this rulemaking. Since that time, EPA has funded additional
studies on humans and piglets which are currently under review.

In the July 25, 1990 notice, EPA stated that there was no evidence of adverse health effects in animals or humans from
chronic exposure to sulfate in drinking water. The available health data indicate that chronic exposure to sulfate
is not harmful to health.

The acute effects noted from exposure to high levels of sulfate range from soft stools to diarrhea. Infants may be more
sensitive to sulfate than healthy adults. Infants consume more water and food on a body weight basis than adults, and
consequently ingest a higher dose of sulfate (per body weight) in drinking high-sulfate water than do adults. In infants,
the greatest risk is from dehydration and electrolyte imbalance that may result from diarrhea. This effect can be
fatal if untreated.

It has been questioned whether the concentration of sulfate found in drinking water would cause significant dehydration
in infants or adults. Schild (1980) reported that eight grams of sulfate retain 120 milliliters of water in the intestine.
In this case, an adult drinking two liters of water containing 1500 milligrams of sulfate per liter would ingest three
grams of sulfate and retain 45 milliliters of water in the intestine. The Agency is requesting any scientific data
which would support or refute the hypothesis that this decrease in available water is likely to cause dehydration
and electrolyte imbalance in adults or infants.

There are three documented case histories of infants, 5 to 12 months old, who were given formulas prepared with water
containing 630 to 1,150 mg/L of sulfate (Chien, et al., 1968). These infants developed diarrhea shortly after they
ingested the formula, but the effect subsided after use of the high sulfate water was discontinued. Cole (1992) evaluated
this study and concluded that neither the potential effects of osmolarity, specifically hyperosmolarity, nor viral
gastroenteritis had been considered as possible causes of the observed diarrhea. Thus, Cole suggested and the Agency
agrees that the Chien study provides qualitative evidence of the effects of sulfate but should not be used quantitatively
in a sulfate risk assessment.

Similar effects have been observed in adults, but individuals seem to become acclimated to high sulfate levels in
a short period of time, with a cessation of all ill effects.

The laxative effect of sulfate is well-known. Peterson (1951) compiled the results of questionnaires sent to North
Dakota residents and concluded that ``waters with 600 to 750 ppm sulfates should be looked upon with suspicion as they
may or may not be laxative. Over 750 ppm sulfates is generally a laxative water and below 600 ppm sulfates should be considered
safe.'' Moore (1952) replotted the Peterson data and found that as sulfate concentrations increased from 500 to 1000
mg/L, the number of adults reporting laxative effects also increased. At concentrations of sulfate above 1,000 mg/L,
the majority of respondents noted a laxative effect. While it is not known how long is needed to achieve acclimation
in adults or infants, EPA scientists believe the time to be approximately two weeks, based on mucosal cell turnover
rate in the intestines.

The Agency is using these studies to support the MCLG, although each has limitations. For example, in the Peterson
(1951) study, there is no information available on the chemical composition or the microbiological quality of the
water, nor on the length of time that people drank the water.

There are insufficient data to calculate a precise and reliable quantification of the exact dose which will cause
diarrhea in a given percentage of the susceptible population. Some sulfate salts are used as laxative agents. Their
mechanism of action is known, and there is apparently little interest in the medical community in additional research
on the subject. Acclimation to sulfate is assumed due to the fact that people living in regions with high-sulfate drinking
water seem to have no adverse effect, whereas newcomers drinking that region's water will initially experience the
laxative effect.

In developing the MCLG for sulfate, issues were raised concerning the ability of infants to acclimate to sulfate in
drinking water. In 1992, EPA convened an expert panel to discuss the sulfate data base (US EPA, 1992). The panel (D.E.C.
Cole, Children's Hospital, Halifax, Nova Scotia; M. Cassidy, George Washington University, Washington, DC; and
M. Morris, State University of New York, Amherst, NY) concluded that the lack of data on the sulfate content and the
osmolarity of the formulas used in the Chien et al. (1968) study prevents it from being a reliable estimate of the level
of sulfate that would induce diarrhea in infants. They concluded that: (1) Additional studies on sulfate are desirable,
(2) the Chien et al. (1968) study cannot be used quantitatively, (3) the 500 mg/L value for sulfate is conservative
for adults, and there are no differences between sulfate levels of 400 and 500 mg/L, (4) the three cases of diarrhea
reported in the Chien study may or may not be attributable to sulfate, and (5) acute short-term effects are the appropriate
focus for risk assessment and further research.

The panel members recommended additional research with piglets and humans. EPA agreed and initiated studies in collaboration
with the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and the North Carolina State University Department of Animal
Science. These studies have been completed and are undergoing internal and external peer review.



2. Occurrence and Human Exposure



The available information on the occurrence and human exposure to sulfate was fully described in the July 25, 1990
proposal. Since that time, additional State data have been gathered and used to update the information in Table 8.

Review of data sources for estimating national occurrence levels of sulfate included: The Community Water Supply
Study (CWSS) released in 1969; the Rural Water Survey (RWS) from the late 1970s; new State survey data from Utah, North
and South Dakota, and Texas: The Federal Reporting Data System (FRDS) and STORET, EPA's computerized water quality
data base. In the CWSS, 106 surface water supplies sampled had an apparent detection limit of 1 mg/L. For the ground
water supplies the mean of the positive sulfate detections was approximately 43 mg/L (range of 1 to 480 mg/L), and for
surface water it was approximately 49 mg/L (range of 2 to 358 mg/L). The Rural Water Survey (RWS) reported a lower frequency
of positives and a higher mean of the positive values, but this lower frequency probably reflects the higher detection
limit of 15 mg/L. In the RWS, sulfate was reported to be present in 271 of 494 ground water supplies with a mean of about
98 mg/L (range of 10 to 1,000 mg/L) for the positives (some laboratories can achieve accuracy at levels lower than the
published detection limit of 15 mg/L). In surface water, it was found in 101 of 154 supplies, with a mean of 53 mg/L (range
of 15 to 321 mg/L) for the positives.

As noted above, sulfate can be formed in the atmosphere, and EPA has reported ambient levels during the period of 1980-1986
to range from 0.2 to 199.4 

m

g/m3. Since the amounts of sulfate that could be transferred from the atmosphere through the pulmonary system to the
gastrointestinal tract are minuscule compared to what could be ingested in drinking water, atmospheric levels are
not of concern for the purposes of this rule.

No information is available on the occurrence of sulfate in foods, nor are there any estimates on dietary intake. The
Agency did not follow its usual practice of determining a relative source contribution (RSC) factor. As with certain
other inorganic contaminants (nitrate, fluoride, barium, manganese), calculation of RSC is not appropriate for
sulfate because the MCLG is derived directly from human exposure to the contaminant in drinking water.



3. Previously Proposed MCLG



In July 1990, EPA proposed two alternative options for the sulfate MCLG based on the available health information.
The first option was to set the MCLG at 400 mg/L, based on a Science Advisory Board (SAB) conclusion that sulfate's mode
of action is well known and some human data are available indicating that ill effects occur only at concentrations
above 600 mg/L (Peterson, 1951). SAB applied a small uncertainty factor of 1.5 to the 600
 mg/L level to give a recommended MCLG of 400 mg/L. Their recommendation corresponded to the World Health Organization
(WHO) sulfate standard of 400 mg/L, which is based on aesthetic considerations.

The second option was to set the MCLG at 500 mg/L. As a basis for choosing this option, EPA referred to the survey conducted
by Peterson (1951) and evaluated by Moore (1952). Combining the questionnaire respondents into discrete groups,
Moore indicated that the number of adults reporting laxative effects increased at sulfate concentrations above
500 mg/L.

The Health Protection Branch of Health and Welfare/Canada has indicated to EPA (Canadian Guidelines, 1991) that
the maximum acceptable concentration of sulfate in water is 500 mg/L, considered an aesthetic objective, since ``at
this level sulfate gives an objectionable taste, but is still below the level at which we would expect to see deleterious
health effects''. The Agency notes that the Canadian sulfate guideline of 500 mg/L and the lack of health problems
reported at that level lends support to the proposed MCLG. Canada does not yet have national drinking water regulations.
Their guidelines are offered to the provinces, which may choose to adopt them as provincial regulations.



Public Comments



There were 15 separate comments concerning sulfate on the 1990 proposed rule. Several commenters believed that EPA
should not regulate sulfate due to a lack of adequate health data, lack of chronic effects and because people acclimate
to the laxative effects of sulfate. Eleven commenters stated that if it were necessary to regulate sulfate, that the
MCLG should be higher than 500 mg/L (between 600 and 1,000 mg/L). The remaining four commenters stated that 500 mg/L
was protective. One commenter stated that the usual approach for deriving the MCLG_an RfD calculation_should be
used for sulfate. Another commenter cited a July 17, 1989 letter from the Metals Subcommittee of the Science Advisory
Board's Environmental Health Committee to the Administrator stating that the Subcommittee could not support the
setting of an acute MCLG, and recommending additional study before regulation. Several commenters urged EPA not
to regulate sulfate, stating that a secondary MCL is sufficient. They noted that infants as well as adults acclimate
to sulfate, sulfate is present in food, and the WHO guidelines are based on taste considerations and not health effects.
Several commenters noted that systems which do not serve the target population, infants in particular, should be
excused from complying with the sulfate regulation. Several commenters questioned EPA's cost analysis.

EPA Response 


Some commenters noted that no chronic health effects have been 
associated with long-term exposure to high levels of sulfate. However, 
sulfate can have acute adverse effects on non-acclimated persons. The 
population at risk is readily identified and targeted for protective 
measures. While the laxative effect eases and disappears as the person 
acclimates to the high sulfate concentration, the individual is subject to 
debilitation during the acclimation period. 
Diarrhea and/or laxative effects have been reported in infants ingesting 
water with high levels of sulfate and in adults at concentrations in the 500 
to 1000 mg/L range. EPA believes an MCL level of 500 mg/L will be 
sufficiently protective of infants and adults. An RfD for sulfate has not 
been determined. 
SMCLs for aesthetic qualities relating to the public acceptance of 
drinking water are not federally enforceable, and intended only as guidance 
for the States. SMCLs do not meet the statutory requirement to set an NPDWR 
for sulfate. 
The requirements for transient and non-transient, non-community water 
systems which do not serve the target population frequently would be minimal. 
They could achieve compliance by placing permanent signs at drinking 
fountains and having bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs available for 
visitors. 
The Agency has updated the occurrence data and the cost analysis since 
the Phase V proposal. 


4. Today's Proposed MCLG 


Today EPA is proposing an MCLG of 500 mg/L which represents the level at 
which no known or anticipated adverse effects on human health occur, and 
which allows for an adequate margin of safety based on current data. As a 
basis for choosing this level, EPA notes that the survey conducted by 
Peterson (1951) and evaluated by Moore (1952) indicated that the number of 
people reporting laxative effects greatly increased at sulfate concentrations 
above 500 mg/L. This concentration is considered protective of infants based 
on the information reported by Chien et al. (1968). 
EPA believes that the MCLG for sulfate should be based on the potential 
for causing loose stools and diarrhea. Infants are at risk from diarrhea 
regardless of the cause, and unacclimated adults may also be at risk. A 
standard to limit the intake of sulfate will protect the infant population 
and unacclimated adults from potential adverse effects. 
EPA requests comment on this proposed MCLG. EPA particularly requests 
any new data or any other new information that may be submitted in support of 
or opposing the reproposed sulfate MCLG of 500 mg/L. In light of comments 
opposing the regulation of sulfate, the Agency is also requesting any new 
data or information that would support a higher level for the MCLG. The 
Agency is particularly interested in comments that raise issues other than 
those that EPA has already considered and responded to above and in the 
record for today's proposal. 


B. Establishment of NPDWR for Sulfate 


1. Methodology for Determination of MCLs 


The SDWA directs EPA to set the MCL ``as close to'' the MCLG ``as is 
feasible.'' The term ``feasible'' means ``feasible with the use of the best 
technology, treatment techniques, and other means, which the Administrator 
finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely 
under laboratory conditions, are available (taking costs into 
consideration)'', (SDWA section 1412(b)(5)). Each NPDWR that establishes an 
MCL lists the technology, treatment techniques, and other means which the 
Administrator finds to be feasible for meeting the MCL (SDWA section 
1412(b)(6)).

<TEXT>
 

The present statutory standard for BAT under 1412(b)(5) represents a 
change from the provision prior to 1986, which required EPA to judge 
feasibility on the basis of ``best technologies generally available'' (BTGA). 
The 1986 Amendments to the SDWA changed BTGA to BAT and added the requirement 
that BAT must be tested for efficacy under field conditions, not just under 
laboratory conditions. The legislative history explains that Congress removed 
the term ``generally'' to assure that MCLs ``reflect the full extent of current technology capability'' (S. Rep.
No. 56, 99th Cong., 1st Session at 6 (1985)). EPA has concluded that the statutory term ``best available technology''
is a broader standard than ``best technology generally available'' and that this standard allows EPA to select a technology
that is not necessarily in widespread use, as long as its performance has been validated in a reliable manner. In addition,
EPA believes that the technology selected need not necessarily have been field tested for each specific contaminant
but, rather, that the operating conditions may be projected for a specific contaminant using a field tested technology
from laboratory or pilot systems data. 
Based on the statutory directive for setting the MCLs, EPA derives the 
MCLs based on an evaluation of (1) the availability and performance of 
various technologies for removing the contaminant, and (2) the costs of 
applying those technologies. Other technology factors considered in 
determining the MCL include the ability of laboratories to measure accurately 
and consistently the level of the contaminant with available analytical 
methods. 
EPA's initial step in deriving the MCL is to make an engineering 
assessment of technologies that are capable of removing a contaminant from 
drinking water. EPA reviews the available data to determine technologies that 
have the highest removal efficiencies, are compatible with other water 
treatment processes, and are not limited to a particular geographic region. 
Based on the removal capabilities of the various technologies, EPA 
calculates the level of each contaminant that is achievable by their 
application to large systems with relatively clean raw water sources. (See H.R. Rep. 1185, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess. at
13 (1974); 132 Cong. Rec. S6287, 
May 21, 1986, statement of Sen. Durenberger.)
When considering costs to control contaminants, EPA analyzes whether the 
technology is reasonably affordable by regional and large metropolitan PWSs 
(See H.R. Rep. No. 93-1185 at 18 (1974) and 132 Cong. Rec. S6287 (May 21, 
1986) (statement of Sen. Durenberger)). EPA also evaluates the total national 
compliance costs, considering the number of systems that will have to install 
treatment in order to comply with the MCL. The resulting total national costs 
vary depending upon the concentration level chosen as the MCL. The more 
stringent the MCL, the greater the number of systems that may have to install 
BAT to achieve compliance and the higher the national cost.
The feasibility of setting the MCL at a precise level is also influenced by laboratory ability to measure the contaminant
reliably. Because compliance 
with the MCL is determined by analysis with approved analytical techniques, 
the ability to analyze consistently and accurately for a contaminant at the 
MCL is important for enforcing a regulatory standard. Thus, the feasibility 
of meeting a particular level is affected by the ability of analytical 
methods to determine with sufficient precision and accuracy whether such a 
level is actually being achieved. 


2. Treatment Technologies and Costs 


In the July 25, 1990 proposal, EPA identified two technologies as BATs 
under Section 1412 of the SDWA for sulfate: Reverse osmosis (RO) and ion 
exchange (IE). EPA believes that the costs of these technologies to large 
systems are reasonable, and that these technologies are compatible with other 
water treatment processes in different regions of the U.S. These technologies 
and the costs of using them are described as follows: 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941220-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941220-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Reverse Osmosis. RO uses semi-permeable membranes to remove a high percentage of almost all inorganic ions. The technology
is relatively insensitive to flow and total dissolved solids (TDS). The effectiveness of RO is adversely affected
by the presence of turbidity, iron, manganese, silica, or scale-producing constituents in the source water. If pretreatment
is not already in place to remove these constituents, additional costs may be incurred to install other technologies
(e.g., pH adjustment, filtration, or scale-prevention additives). The cost generated by the model includes the
cost of a scale inhibitor. On the other hand, in situations where high dissolved solids and/or several contaminants
may have to be removed simultaneously, the RO process may offer an especially desirable and cost-effective approach
to their removal. Less chlorine may be needed due to removal of many bacteria and viruses during the RO process. 

Disadvantages to RO include fouling of membranes either from scaling or from water with high organic content and a
reject stream of 20% to 50% of the water flow. It is also possible that corrosion control chemicals will be needed after
RO, and a more qualified operator may be needed. 

Full scale tests indicate that RO is capable of removing between 86 and 97 percent of the sulfate, and is effectively
used for the reduction of contaminants other than sulfate. Estimated cost for reducing sulfate by RO range from $3.50/1,000
gallons for systems serving between 500 and 1,000 persons to $1.00/1,000 gallons for systems serving more than 1,000,000
persons. High sulfate levels are typically associated with high levels of TDS, which can indicate the presence of
other inorganics; in such cases, RO becomes a cost effective treatment technology because it removes those other
inorganics as well. Since the removal efficiency required for sulfate will typically be less than 86 percent, a portion
of the water can be treated and blended with an untreated portion to reduce the cost of this process. 

Commenters to the Phase V proposed rule expressed concerns regarding the potential costs associated with disposal
of wastes generated by treatment processes such as RO, particularly in water-scarce regions. The Agency believes
that wastewater would be minimized, since only a portion of source water containing elevated sulfate levels would
need to be treated, and would then be blended with source water. With an MCL of 500 mg/L, EPA believes blending treated
water and source water would greatly reduce the reject stream. 

Ion Exchange. IE reduces sulfate concentrations to levels below the MCLG of 500 mg/L at reasonable costs to large systems.
Typical sulfate anion removals using IE are greater than 75 percent in full-scale studies that evaluated influent
concentrations close to drinking water levels. Estimated costs for IE to reduce sulfate concentrations range from
$2.90/1,000 gallons for systems serving between 500 and 1,000 persons to $1.40/1,000 gallons for systems serving
more than 1,000,000 people. When the removal efficiency required for sulfate is less than 75 percent, a portion of
the water can be treated and blended with an untreated portion to reduce cost. For those systems with other anions that
need to be removed (such as nitrate), the removal efficiency will decrease for those anions since sulfate binds more
strongly to the exchange resin than other anions. A disadvantage of IE is that it may not be feasible at high levels of
TDS. 

EPA received a number of public comments on the proposal to select RO and IE as BATs for the Phase V inorganic contaminants
in general and for sulfate in particular. EPA's responses are in the comment-response document for the Phase V rulemaking
and in the preamble to the final rule (57 FR 31809-12). In the preamble, EPA responded to comments on sulfate in
particular concerning the disposal of wash brines from IE and RO treatments in water-scarce areas and on the costs
of using RO and IE to treat for sulfate. EPA is not aware of any new information on these two technologies or costs since
the proposal. Interested parties are invited to submit any new public comments or new information on the selection
of RO and IE as BAT for sulfate. 

Electrodialysis. Since the Phase V proposal, EPA has identified electrodialysis (ED) as an additional proposed
BAT. EPA requests comment on its conclusion that electrodialysis should also be considered BAT for sulfate. 

ED was the first membrane process developed for desalting brackish waters, and was commercially available in the
1950's. In the early 1970's, a major technological improvement was made, called electrodialysis reversal. Recovery
ratios increased from the 50% to 60% range to 80% to 90% recovery. 

In ED, feed water containing dissolved ions is pumped across electrified membranes. The positive ions migrate to
the negative electrode, and the negative ions migrate to the positive electrode, and are effectively trapped in alternating
compartments. The partially deionized/dilute stream is circulated through additional stages until the desired
purity is obtained. Since this is a unidirectional process, membrane fouling and mineral scale formation tend to
degrade system performance. Some pretreatment may be required, such as clarification, presoftening, or treatment
with acid or anti-scaling agents. 

Electrodialysis reversal (EDR) is the same process but with the polarity of the current automatically reversed at
regular 15 to 30-minute intervals. This changes the direction of ion movement within the membrane stack. As a result,
foulants and scale tend to be removed from the membrane surfaces and carried away during the purge period. EDR requires
minimum pretreatment and is very tolerant of system upsets, shock chlorination, and long-term operation at temperatures
up to 45 C. Sulfate removal of 84% was achieved in a 1990 pilot study in Virginia, in which efficiency and costs for RO
and EDR were compared (AWWA, 1991). 

Operating costs for EDR are comparable to those for RO. All reference to ED as BAT for sulfate removal in this notice
will refer to electrodialysis reversal, rather than unidirectional electrodialysis. Table 3 summarizes the efficiency
and cost of the treatment technologies proposed as BATs for sulfate, and indicates that each can reduce the contaminant
level from the maximum expected occurrence level to below the proposed MCLG. The costs in Table 3 are representative
of annual operation and maintenance (O & M) costs plus annualized capital costs, and may differ depending on local
conditions. Costs may be lower if sulfate concentration levels encountered in the raw water are lower than those used
for the calculations, or higher if additional system-specific treatment or storage requirements are needed. The
general assumptions used to develop the treatment costs include: Capital costs amortized over 20 years at a 7 percent
interest rate; engineering fees; contractor overhead and profit; late 1991 power, fuel, labor and chemical costs.
The removal efficiencies cited in Table 3 are what is possible, and are not directly linked with the cited costs. These
costs are linked with the efficiency needed to achieve the sulfate MCL.

3. Sulfate Analytical Methods 



a. 

Choice of analytical method.

 The reliability of analytical methods used for compliance monitoring is critical at the MCL. EPA evaluated the availability,
costs and the performance of analytical methods for measuring sulfate, and considered the ability of laboratories
to measure consistently and accurately for sulfate at the level of the proposed MCL. 

In selecting analytical methods, EPA considers five factors: 

(a) Reliability (i.e., precision/accuracy) of the analytical results; 

(b) Specificity in the presence of interferences; 

(c) Availability of enough equipment and trained personnel to implement a national monitoring program; 

(d) Simplicity of analysis to permit routine use; and 

(e) Cost of analysis to water supply systems. 

Sulfate has an SMCL of 250 mg/L for which EPA recommends measurements be made with an EPA method or a Standard Method
(SM) method (40 CFR 143.4(b)), each of which uses a turbidimetric analytical technique. The July 1990 proposal listed
analytical methods for sulfate that use one of four analytical techniques: turbidimetry, colorimetry, ion chromatography,
and gravimetry. The July 1992 regulations did not regulate sulfate, but specified a colorimetric analytical technique
to measure sulfate as an unregulated contaminant (40 CFR 141.409(n)(12)). However, the regulations did not list
specific colorimetric methods. In an analytical methods proposal (58 FR 60622, December 15, 1993) EPA removed this
ambiguity by identifying several colorimetric methods. The December 1993 proposal also proposed methods that use
other analytical techniques, and improved laboratory efficiency by allowing all sulfate methods to be used for both
secondary and unregulated contaminant monitoring. 

Today EPA is proposing methods that use colorimetric, gravimetric or ion chromatographic analytical techniques.
The methods are proposed for analysis of sulfate as regulated and as a secondary contaminant. For information on the
precision and accuracy of these methods, EPA refers readers to the references in Table 4. 






EPA is not proposing turbidimetric methods because the methods are inadequate. The operating range of turbidimetric
methods is 0 to 40 mg/L, which requires excessive dilution of the sample to cover the range between the SMCL (250 mg/L)
and the proposed MCL (500 mg/L). EPA recommends that compliance samples not be diluted more than four or five-fold
to obtain reliable and reproducible results. The gravimetric and colorimetric chromatographic methods require
acceptable dilution of the sample to measure samples containing more than 350 mg/L of sulfate. 

Colorimetric and gravimetric methods have been used for many years to measure sulfate in water, and were described
in the July 1990 proposal. As stated in the July 1992 rule, EPA agrees with comments that only methylthymol blue, not
chloranilate, colorimetric methods are suitable for sulfate analysis. Therefore, EPA is only proposing methylthymol
blue colorimetric methods for sulfate analysis. 

Ion chromatographic methods have been approved for measurement of nitrate and nitrite (40 CFR 141.23) in drinking
water. These methods have been described or discussed in the July 1990 and the December 1993 proposals, and in 54 FR
22097 (May 22, 1989). EPA is proposing ion chromatographic methods for sulfate analysis only with the suppressed
column option. EPA has no data to support use of a ``non-suppressed'' column (57 FR 31800), and the Agency is not proposing
to approve this option in any ion chromatographic method. 

EPA believes the proposed analytical methods are technologically and economically feasible for sulfate monitoring.
The analytical cost for sulfate is $10 to $30 per sample. EPA believes these costs are affordable. Actual analytical
costs may vary with the laboratory, analytical technique selected, the total number of samples and other factors.
The number of laboratories that routinely participate in EPA's Water Supply and Water Pollution performance evaluation
studies indicates that many laboratories have the capability to conduct analysis for sulfate. 

Sulfate has a long history as a water quality parameter. There is a large body of performance data available for water
pollution studies. The proposed analytical methods have detection limits much lower than the proposed MCLG for sulfate.
The detection limit for a given contaminant varies with the analytical method (Table 5). 

b. 

Method detection limits and practical quantitation levels.

 EPA determines practical quantitation levels (PQLs) for each substance for the purpose of integrating analytical
chemistry data into regulation development. The PQL yields a limit on measurement and identifies specific precision
and accuracy requirements which EPA uses to develop regulatory requirements. As such, PQLs are a regulatory device
rather than a standard that labs must specifically demonstrate they can meet. The PQLs for inorganic compounds are
determined based on the method detection limits (MDLs) and the results from performance evaluation data. 






The PQL for sulfate was determined using the MCL as well as EPA and State laboratory data from Water Pollution PE studies
using the procedure described in 54 FR 22100 (May 22, 1989). A PQL of 10 mg/L was proposed for sulfate in the Phase V proposed
rule (55 FR 30411, July 25, 1990). Since the detection limit using the colorimetric method is 3 mg/L, EPA is soliciting
comment on whether a higher PQL of 30 mg/L should be set in order to retain the colorimetric method. 

c. 

Sulfate sample preservation, container and holding times.

 Requirements for sample preservation, containers and holding times listed in Table 6 were proposed for sulfate in
the 1990 proposal. No comments were received on these specifications. The Agency is reproposing these requirements
today.

<TEXT>
 



d. Laboratory certification.

 Today EPA is proposing that only certified laboratories be allowed to analyze samples for compliance with the proposed
MCL for sulfate. EPA recognizes that the effectiveness of today's proposed regulations depends on the ability of
laboratories to reliably analyze contaminants at low levels. EPA has a drinking water laboratory certification
program that States must adopt as a part of primacy. (40 CFR 142.10(b)) EPA's Manual for the Certification of Laboratories
Analyzing Drinking Water, EPA/570/9-90/008, April, 1990, specifies minimum criteria which States must use to implement
their drinking water laboratory certification program.

Performance evaluation (PE) samples are an important tool in EPA's laboratory certification program. The samples
are provided by EPA or the States to laboratories seeking certification. To obtain and maintain certification a laboratory
must use an approved method, and at least once a year successfully analyze an appropriate PE sample. Successful analysis
requires that a laboratory report a concentration of sulfate in the PE-sample that is within the acceptance limits.
Specification of these proposed limits, which are listed in drinking water regulations at  141.23(k), is discussed
below.



e. Setting PE sample acceptance limits for sulfate. 

Acceptable performance has historically been set by EPA using two different approaches: (1) Regressions from performance
of preselected laboratories (using 95 percent confidence limits), or (2) specified accuracy requirements. Acceptance
limits based on specified accuracy requirements are developed from existing PE study data. When there are insufficient
PE data to determine expected laboratory performance, EPA determines acceptance limits from individual study statistics
based upon 95 percent confidence limits. After sufficient performance data are generated from PE studies, EPA will
develop fixed acceptance limits using a ``plus or minus of the true value approach.'' The true value approach requires
each laboratory to demonstrate its ability to perform within pre-defined limits. Laboratory performance is evaluated
using a constant yardstick independent of performance achieved by other laboratories participating in the same
study. A fixed criterion based on a percent error around the ``true'' value reflects the experience obtained from
numerous laboratories and includes relationships of the accuracy and precision of the measurement to the concentration
of the analyte. It also assumes little or no bias in the analytical methods that may result in average reporting values
different from the reference ``true'' value. This concept assures that reported results can be related to the percentage
variance from the PQL.

Performance data are available for sulfate at concentrations proposed for regulation. The data are sufficient to
set fixed acceptance limits of 

#

 15% for sulfate PE samples. The acceptance limits are estimated using the approach described in 54 FR 22132.



4. Establishment of a NPDWR





a. Today's Proposed MCL.

 Today EPA is proposing an MCL for sulfate of 500 mg/L, which is equal to the proposed MCLG. EPA believes that costs for
large systems are reasonable and affordable, and that it is technologically feasible for PWSs to achieve this level
for sulfate. EPA also believes that the flexibility afforded by Option 1 allows small systems to comply with the MCL
in a way that is reasonable and affordable.

Examination of the BATs identified above (RO, IE, and ED) indicates that each can reduce the levels of sulfate from
the maximum expected occurrence levels to levels below the proposed MCLG of 500 mg/L (minimum removal efficiencies
of 86%, 75%, and 80%, respectively). The maximum reported occurrence level for sulfate in a national study (RWS) is
1,000 mg/L, although individual State data have shown levels twice as high. Each of these technologies is currently
available, has been installed in PWSs, is compatible with other water treatment processes, and can remove sulfate
from the maximum occurrence level to below the proposed MCLG. EPA is proposing an MCL for sulfate based upon an analysis
of several factors, including:

(1) The effectiveness of BAT in reducing sulfate levels from influent concentrations to the MCLG.

(2) The feasibility (including costs) of applying BAT. EPA considered the availability of the technology and the
costs of installation and operation for large systems.

(3) The performance of available analytical methods.



b. Lead option for implementing the MCL requirement.

 As described in the Regulatory Background section, EPA determined that sulfate is found primarily in small PWSs in
the western part of the U.S., and that compliance with the sulfate MCL would place a significant burden on these systems.
EPA decided that a requirement for PWSs to comply with the sulfate MCL by treating all of their source water might be
excessive since high sulfate levels affect only persons who are not acclimated to the water. Therefore, the Agency
decided in 1992 to defer the regulation for sulfate in order to consider ways of allowing PWSs to comply with the MCL
that would not require central treatment.

To develop alternative options for complying with the MCL, EPA held a meeting with interested States and the Association
of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA). In November 1992, officials from Texas, South Dakota, Colorado,
and New Mexico, ASDWA staff, EPA Regional staff, and EPA Headquarters staff met to explore regulatory options for
sulfate. They discussed the regulatory process, a toxicological profile of sulfate, and State perspectives on sulfate
regulation, health effects and implementation options. Neither the issue of whether or not to regulate sulfate nor
the MCL/MCLG levels were topics of discussion. The participants felt that the sulfate regulation should give the
States flexibility. After the discussions at this meeting, most of the States present supported the conclusion that
PWSs should be allowed to protect their customers from the risk of sulfate levels exceeding the MCL either by centralized
treatment or through public education/notification and provision of Alternative Water. The outline of a regulatory
option that included all of these elements was formulated. Each of the components was directed at a certain population
and the majority agreed that those components, together, would be adequately protective. The option developed at
that meeting is essentially Option 1, being proposed today. In the past, EPA has not generally set restrictions or
conditions on the means of compliance with the MCL. Traditionally, EPA simply identifies the central treatment technologies
that are considered BAT and then sets the MCL based on the capabilities of those technologies to remove the contaminant.
PWSs are not required to use the identified BATs but must achieve compliance with the MCL. EPA regulations prohibit
PWSs from using bottled water or POU devices to achieve compliance with the MCL. In addition, the regulations prohibit
PWSs from using POE devices to achieve compliance with the MCL unless the PWS meets certain conditions for ensuring
effective protection of all consumers. See 40 CFR 141.100 and 141.101. In Option 1, EPA proposes to override the general
prohibition on the use of bottled water and POU/POE devices and to allow States to authorize PWSs to use these methods
to achieve compliance with the MCL.



c. Method of compliance.

 The State would have the authority under Option 1 to allow PWSs to achieve compliance with the sulfate MCL by one of two
methods. The PWS could comply either by using conventional central treatment or by providing Alternative Water.
With the State's authorization, PWSs would have the choice of supplying bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs,
POU or POE devices to target populations. Under Option 1, PWSs that provide Alternative Water would also need to meet
certain public education/notification requirements. Transient systems would also have to provide Alternative
Water, but their public notification requirement would be posting of signs, unless POE/POU devices brought all taps
into compliance. This approach directly focuses protection on the sensitive populations: Infants, travelers and
new residents. Under Option 1, any program developed by a PWS would need to contain the following provisions or others
which it can demonstrate are at least as stringent and protective:

<TEXT>
 

(1) Community Water Systems

(i) Bottled water.

PWSs would need to provide and deliver two liters of bottled water per person per day (unless the customer requests
less), on request, to households with infants, new residents, or transients (visitors). The bottled water would
have to have been monitored or certified to be in compliance with all EPA MCLs. PWSs would be allowed to deliver enough
water for several weeks, or the entire time period, at once, and would not be required to provide daily delivery. Infants,
up to one year old, would receive bottled water for a maximum of 20 weeks from the date of request. Since a mother may nurse
her infant during the first year, it would be her decision as to when to begin giving the infant tap water. Each new resident
(person moving to the high-sulfate community from another location) would receive bottled water for a maximum of
six weeks. New residents with infants up to one year old would receive bottled water for their infant for 20 weeks. New
residents with infants older than one year would receive bottled water for themselves and their infant for six weeks.
Since new residents would be informed about the Alternative Water by the PWS at the time of starting water service to
their residence, the six weeks would begin at that time. Travelers (guests visiting residents and hotel guests) would
receive bottled water for the period requested, not to exceed six weeks. In resident households with infants, the
public water system would only need to supply bottled water for the infant in the household. EPA is not proposing to
require that bottled water be provided to resident pregnant women prior to childbirth, since there seems to be no transfer
of sulfate through the placenta.

The rule would require PWSs supplying Alternative Water to determine an equitable way of recouping their expenses
in providing that service without charging a premium to the recipients of the Alternative Water. EPA believes that
an additional charge for Alternative Water (above and beyond what would normally be charged for the water if it had
been delivered through the distribution system) would be a disincentive to a consumer's decision to request Alternative
Water and receive protection from high levels of sulfate. Therefore, the proposed rule would prohibit PWSs from charging
a premium. The Agency believes this is necessary in order to ``assure a supply of drinking water which dependably complies
with'' the sulfate MCL (see SDWA Section 1401(1)(D)). Each utility would need to determine the best way to meet its
operating expenses without imposing a premium on the subpopulation of customers that is receiving Alternative Water
under the sulfate rule. For example, a PWS could charge the same unit cost for each liter of bottled water as it charges
for centrally-distributed water. The number of liters of bottled water delivered to a household would simply be added
to the number of liters of centrally-distributed water that appears on the meter, and the same unit cost would apply
to the entire volume. EPA requests comment on whether it is appropriate to restrict the PWS's fee structure in this
way. In particular, the Agency is interested in whether there are State or local ratemaking laws or other laws that
bear on this issue.

Two liters per day is the amount of water selected to be provided since that is the consumption level used by EPA in calculating
risk estimates, and is the 85th percentile consumption level of water for the U.S. population. Infants are considered
to consume one liter per day, but since they comprise a small portion of the target population, two liters per day for
all members of the target population is retained for simplicity of implementation. Twenty weeks was chosen as the
period for providing bottled water to infants since EPA staff scientists believe that this is a sufficiently lengthy
period for infants to become gradually acclimated to high sulfate-containing water. Similarly, six weeks was chosen
as the period for providing bottled water to new residents and travelers (guests) to allow gradual acclimation. Although
two weeks is the period necessary to acclimate to high sulfate levels if a person is exposed continually to high-sulfate
water, this rapid time frame would require the person to experience the adverse effect. In addition, new residents
and travelers are likely to have many activities occupying their attention which may prevent them from accomplishing
the acclimation in a shorter time period. EPA is requesting comment on these allotted time periods.

The notice provided to customers by the PWS would advise that during the period when bottled water is provided, there
should be mixing of bottled water with tap water to allow gradual acclimation of the digestive system to the high-sulfate
water. If gradual introduction of tap water is not done, there could still be adverse health effects when use of bottled
water ceases.

The PWS would be responsible for providing bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs on request to any household which
has an infant or travelers (guests), and to any household with new residents who have moved to the community from outside
the service area.

Monitoring requirements to ensure that the bottled water meets the 
sulfate MCL and other MCLs are explained in the section below on Compliance 
Monitoring Requirements. 

PWSs would need to maintain a record of public requests for 
bottled water, either by a telephone log or other means, by which the date 
of the request and the date of delivery are recorded and maintained for 
State verification. 

If the public notification is done effectively, it is not 
anticipated that emergency delivery of bottled water will be necessary. 
Customers should have the time to notify the PWS well in advance of the 
desired delivery date. In the event that a customer has not had access to 
the public notification and is unable to procure bottled water prior to the 
normal delivery by the PWS, the PWS should have the ability to provide an 
emergency delivery within 24 hours of receiving the request. 

(ii) Public Education/Notification. 

Public education and public notification are important in making 
people aware of the potential adverse health effects of high levels of 
sulfate and educating them about how to protect themselves if they are 
within the targeted population. For CWSs, there are four components to the 
proposed public education and public notification requirement: Notices in 
bills, pamphlets, signs and notices to the media. In communities where a 
significant portion of the population speaks a language other than English, 
the text would need to be in the appropriate language(s), in addition to 
English. 

Notices in Bills. PWSs would be required to use their bill 
notices to inform residents of the sulfate content in their water and its 
potential impact on non-acclimated persons. The compliance requirements for 
mail delivery would be the same as those for the general public 
notification mail delivery requirements in  141.32(a) (2) and (3), except 
that the interval for sulfate notification is proposed to be every six 
months rather than three months. EPA is proposing to specify a six-month 
interval to assure that a pregnant woman would receive at least one notice 
during the term of her pregnancy. The notice would have to be typed in bold 
lettering on the bill itself. There would also need to be an additional 
page with more information on the potential health effect from ingesting 
high levels of sulfate in drinking water. That page would include 
information about how expectant mothers and residents can request and 
receive bottled water for infants and guests, how to mix tap water with 
bottled water over time to gradually acclimate the person to sulfate, as 
well as a section reassuring the consumer that there are no ill effects 
from high sulfate-containing water for residents. 

The PWS would also need to provide the same notice to new 
customers or billing units prior to or at the time service begins. 

Pamphlets. PWSs would be required to provide pamphlets to all 
medical facilities, which includes, but is not limited to city, county and 
State health departments, pharmacies, public and private hospitals and 
clinics, family planning clinics and local welfare agencies. The PWS would 
need to request that the operators of those facilities make the pamphlets 
available to pregnant women. The pamphlets would contain the information 
listed above for notices in bills. 

Signs. PWSs would be required to post permanent, prominent and 
visible signs in all public areas where not all taps will have treated 
water. 

Notices to the Media. PWSs would be required to submit copies of 
the notice described above to radio and television stations that broadcast 
to the community served by the water system when sulfate in excess of the 
MCL has been detected in the water, and once every six months while the 
water delivered into the distribution system exceeds the sulfate MCL. The 
geographical service area in question would have to be indicated and 
clearly defined in the notice. 

(2) Transient Systems and Non-Transient, Non-Community Systems 

(i) Bottled Water and POU/POE Devices 

Transient systems, which comprise most of the affected systems 
(1,200 of 1,950), and non-transient, non-community systems would be 
required to make either bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs or water 
treated with a POU/POE device available for travelers at establishments in 
the service area. Where the target population is affected on a relatively 
continual basis, PWSs may find it more cost-effective to provide POU or POE 
devices. Where the system rarely serves members of the target population, 
it might choose to have a supply of bottled water on hand. Non-transient, 
non-community water systems, such as schools, factories and hospitals, 
might choose to install POEs in their cafeterias. PWSs would be responsible 
for maintaining POU/POE devices to ensure their continuing effectiveness. 

(ii) Public Education/Notification 

Public notification for transient systems and non-transient, non-
community systems would be posting of signs. Such systems have no 
customers to ``bill'', and notices to the media and pamphlets would not be 
effective or necessary. PWSs would be required to post permanent, 
prominent and visible signs, made of durable material such as plastic, in 
places such as rest areas, campgrounds, gas stations and public areas. The 
signs would target travelers and newcomers, and would alert the public to 
the health effects of sulfate and the nearest location of drinking water 
for individuals not acclimated to high sulfate levels. The signs would 
have to be placed in any location where all taps (i.e., faucets, fountains, 
or other source of water that could be used for drinking) are not providing 
water in compliance with the sulfate MCL. If the location has a POE 
device, posting would not be necessary, since all taps would provide water 
that complies with the MCL. In the case of campgrounds, sources such as 
hand pumps or trailer hook-ups would be posted with signs, and bottled 
water could be available at the entrance gate or registration area. The 
Agency recognizes that there are unmanned, remote campgrounds in the 
national parks system, and requests comment on the means of compliance for 
those systems. 

(3) Rationale 

The sanctioning of Alternative Water as a means of compliance is 
an innovative approach that EPA has developed in recognition of the special 
circumstances and concerns surrounding the sulfate regulation. The proposed 
option would provide Alternative Water to sensitive populations only for 
the period of time needed for acclimation. The Alternative Water approach 
is appropriate in this case because the target populations are readily 
identifiable and because their need is short-term. Option 1 provides PWSs 
flexibility and seeks to alleviate the financial burden that central 
treatment might entail for small PWSs, and as such is in accordance with 
the objectives of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 

EPA believes that the requirements of Option 1 for PWSs to provide 
bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs or POU/POE devices and to 
provide public notice and education, taken together, will assure a supply 
of drinking water to the Target Population which dependably complies with 
the MCL for sulfate (see SDWA Section 1401(1)(D).

As detailed below in the section on costs, EPA finds that this 
Alternative Water approach would result in an annual national cost of $86 
million annually, as compared to an annual cost for central treatment by 
all affected systems of $147 million. The $86 million estimate would be 
substantially lower except that EPA assumed conservatively that about 25% 
of affected systems would choose central treatment or regionalization even 
with Option 1 available to them. Of the $86 million, $7 million would be 
the cost to the 1,500 systems choosing the public notification/Alternative 
Water method of compliance, and $71 million would be the cost to the 500 
systems choosing central treatment. 

To understand how the logistics of the option would work, the 
Agency chose two system sizes: A PWS serving a town of 500 people, and 
another serving a town of 3,300 people. As very few systems (approximately 
40) serving 3,300 people or more are expected to exceed the sulfate MCL, 
this system size was chosen to illustrate that it would be more cost-
effective for a system of that size to centrally treat. Costs were 
calculated by using national averages. 

In a population of 500, the Agency assumed (based on analysis of 
U.S. Census Bureau and Current Population Reports data) that there would be 
eight households (500 times 1.68%) with infants and 30 households with new 
residents (500 times 16.4% divided by 2.6 persons per household) at any 
given time. (EPA assumed that an average household contains 2.6 people. 
New residents and infants would require Alternative Water for 6 weeks and 
20 weeks, respectively. A system serving this population of 500 would be 
required to deliver a maximum of approximately 8,800 liters of bottled 
water annually, or 24 liters per day, as illustrated by the calculations 
below. 




30 households x 2.6 persons x 2 liters x 42 days=6,552 liters 

8 infants x 2 liters x 140 days=2,240 liters 

Total Annual Bottled Water Needs=8,792 liters 

Average Daily Bottled Water Needs 8,792/365 days=24 liters 




The above calculation is given as an example only, and the 24-
liter figure is a high estimate. The required mixing of tap water with 
bottled water over time for infants and new residents would reduce their 
consumption of bottled water. The cost analysis in the RIA for this 
rulemaking assumes that bottled water will represent, on average, half the 
water consumption for infants and new residents, and that customers will 
exercise their option to have less than 2 liters per day delivered over the 
entire period. 

Although it is up to the water system to decide how to deliver the 
water, the Agency finds that the system could contract the delivery service 
out to a bottled water supplier or could procure and distribute bottled 
water itself. For the sake of simplifying the model, EPA assumed that a 
town with a population of 500 would not have to install any POUs or POEs, 
and would rely entirely on bottled water for the target population. The 
Agency recognizes that, in actuality, some percentage of such towns may 
have a restaurant and/or gas station, and could use a POU/POE device. 
However, these towns would be few in number, and the simplified model is 
retained for costing purposes only. If such a town had very few travelers 
passing through, for example, a restaurant or gas station might find it 
more cost-effective to use permanent signs and have bottled water available 
for those few travelers. EPA assumes that systems which rarely serve the 
target population would comply by posting signs and having bottled water 
available for visitors, rather than install POE/POU devices. The Agency 
solicits comment on the types of Alternative Water that PWSs would choose. 

For a town with a population of 3300, the logistics become more 
complicated. The estimated number of households with infants increases from 
8 to 55. The number of households with new residents becomes 210, and the 
number of liters of bottled water to be delivered per day is approximately 
170. It is also estimated that there will be 3 POU units per town. The 
Agency thinks that few PWSs serving populations this large will choose 
Option 1, and will choose instead to centrally treat. 

There are several disadvantages to Option 1. First, it requires 
persons to learn about sulfate and take action to protect themselves. 
Second, because high-sulfate water is still available at the tap, Option 1 
does not guarantee that all target audiences will be protected. The Agency 
requests comment on the feasibility, equity, enforceability, and 
attractiveness of the option. 

Although EPA believes that allowing compliance with the MCL 
through the use of POUs, POEs, and bottled water is acceptable in the case 
of sulfate, the Agency continues to believe that it should not be allowed 
in the case of other drinking water contaminants, for which the general 
prohibitions in 40 CFR 141.100 and 141.101 still would apply. Option 1 
proposes to override the prohibition in these sections against using 
bottled water and POU devices as a means of compliance with the sulfate MCL 
because of its unique characteristics. The susceptible population is 
limited, and the health effects are short-lived, so the logistics of Option 
1 are feasible for smaller systems. The effects are immediate, so the 
cause/effect relationship of drinking water containing high levels of 
sulfate can be easily demonstrated, and the affected population can be 
readily convinced of the need for precautions. EPA is unaware of any other 
drinking water contaminant having these unique features. Therefore, EPA 
considers Alternative Water and public notification/education to be 
acceptable means for compliance with the MCL for sulfate, but not for other 
contaminants, given current information on health risk and treatment costs. 

Because of the burden of administering Alternative Water in larger 
systems, noncompliance and the difficulties of enforcement become larger 
concerns. Therefore, EPA considered, but decided against, limiting the 
availability of Option 1 to smaller systems (e.g., systems serving fewer 
than 3,300 persons). Such a limitation would be unlikely to have any 
practical effect since, for cost efficiency reasons, systems above this 
size would probably choose central treatment. Also, EPA's occurrence 
projections indicate that few if any systems above 3,300 are likely to 
exceed a sulfate MCL of 500 mg/L.

d. 

Other options being considered.

 Option 1 above is EPA's preferred approach to regulating sulfate in drinking water and is being proposed by EPA today.
EPA believes that Option 1 fully complies with SDWA's scheme for establishing drinking water regulations and is the
best approach for regulating sulfate. However, there has been considerable discussion as to the necessity for federal
regulatory action in protecting the public from the real, yet temporary laxative effect of sulfate. Various commentors
on the 1990 proposal argued that sulfate should not be regulated at all because diarrhea does not present a significant
risk to health, but rather is only an inconvenience.

The Agency has a statutory requirement to regulate sulfate. In light of the above comments, EPA is seriously considering
the following additional options for regulating sulfate. EPA solicits public comment and scientific evidence on
all of the options being considered.

Option 2 Under this option, the sulfate MCL and MCLG would be set at 500 mg/L. However, the target population
would be limited to only infants, that is, only infants would need to be provided drinking water that meets the MCL for
sulfate. The rationale for this option is that infants are the only population subgroup potentially subject to a significant
risk to health, not due to the initial effect (diarrhea), but due to their inability to modify their environment or
fluid intake, and the possibility that dehydration could occur if no action is taken. Under this Option, EPA would
be taking the position that the laxative effect is more of an inconvenience than an adverse health effect in adults,
and that no protection of adults is necessary.

The implementation of Option 2 would require the same public notification/education activities outlined in Option
1, with modifications in the text to limit the target population to infants. The text would state that only infants
are exposed to significant risk from sulfate ingestion. Just as in Option 1, CWSs in excess of the sulfate MCL would
be required to provide notices in bills, signs, pamphlets and media notices to their customers in the service area.
These CWSs would be required to deliver Alternative Water upon request to households with infants for a maximum of
20 weeks during their first year of life. Transient systems and non-transient, non-community systems would be required
to post signs and assure a supply of bottled water for infants if there is any possibility of an infant being present
at the facility. Since the target population is comprised only of infants, the allocation of bottled water would be
1 liter per day, rather than the 2 liters per day proposed under Option 1 for adults and infants. For costing purposes,
the Agency assumes that under Option 2, no PWS would choose central treatment as a means of compliance. This assumption
is based on the relatively small number of infants (less than 2% of a given population) and the option's relatively
low administrative and logistical costs. The cost of arranging delivery of bottled water and providing public notification
in the service area would be lower than the cost of installing central treatment. However, it is possible that a large
PWS, in anticipation of future regulations for other contaminants, or to comply with other existing regulations
for contaminants that can be removed by the same treatment technologies as sulfate (e.g., RO), might, in reality,
choose central treatment. Such a system may find the permanent requirement to provide public notification and bottled
water to the target population to be a long-term administrative burden that is ultimately less cost-effective than
central treatment. A disadvantage to this option is the possible precedent that would be set by an EPA statement that
diarrhea is not considered an adverse effect for adults.

Option 3 Option 3 differs from Option 2 in the definition of the targetpopulation. The target population would
be composed, as in Option 1, of infants and transient adults (including new residents), all of whom are subject to the
adverse effect. However, unlike Option 1, there would be two different strategies under Option 3 to protect the two
target population subgroups, infants and adults. As in Option 2, Alternative Water would have to be provided for infants.
Unlike Option 2 however, PWSs would be required to notify transient adults of their risk, even though not required
to provide them with Alternative Water. Public education/notification requirements would be identical to those
described for Option 1 for both subgroups, except that the text of the notices would state that Alternative Water is
only provided for infants upon request of the parent. Just as in Option 2, CWSs exceeding the sulfate MCL would be required
to provide notices in bills, signs, pamphlets and media notices to their customers in the service area, and deliver
bottled water upon request to households with infants for a maximum of 20 weeks. Similarly, transient and non-transient,
non-community systems would be required to post signs and maintain a supply of bottled water.

The rationale for Option 3 is that it is necessary to set the MCL at a protective level, but sufficient for compliance
purposes to provide notification/education to the affected adult population. This option is based on the theory
that adequate protection for adults can be achieved through proper education and notification. Informed adults
would be able to reduce or avoid the effect by taking the initiative to purchase bottled water or otherwise abstain
from drinking tap water. Infants, on the other hand, depend on adults for their survival, and the minimization of diarrhea's
effects depends on the adult's gradual mixing of the infant's tap water with water that complies with the sulfate MCL.
Consequently, more stringent requirements (provision of Alternative Water) would be imposed to ensure protection
of infants. The disadvantage of this option is that it requires members of the affected public to protect themselves
after being notified of a potential risk.

e. 

Implications of Options 1, 2 and 3.

 Options 1, 2 and 3 represent a significant change from the Agency's approach in other drinking water regulations.
The principal advantage to these options is the reduced cost to systems. However, there are potential disadvantages
in terms of policy implications to adopting any of these options which should be addressed and debated with public
participation. EPA recognizes that there may be concern over the decision not to require PWSs to treat their water
centrally but to allow them to supply water at levels that may exceed the sulfate MCL, and to rely on the provision of
Alternative Water at the consumer's end to ensure ultimate compliance. A disadvantage of these three options is that
it is possible that some members of sensitive subpopulations may still drink untreated tap water from the distribution
system and thus, not be protected. Consumers may be unaware of the need to request Alternative Water, or may find it
too burdensome to do so. While EPA believes that this strategy conforms with the requirements and intent of the Safe
Drinking Water Act, EPA requests comment on this issue.

Options 1, 2 and 3 also require more assertive action by the public to ensure protection, especially those served by
a CWS. This is true for Option 1, where adults in the target population would be required to contact the CWS for Alternative
Water, which would then be delivered. Even more assertive action is needed for Option 3, since informed adults would
have to obtain Alternative Water themselves. For Options 2 and 3, in transient systems, an adult wishing Alternative
Water might not readily find it, as there would be no requirement to have it available, except for infants. The Agency
is requesting comment on whether this need for assertive action would be appropriate, or whether such a strategy is
reasonable, given the unique aspects of sulfate.

Option 2 is based on the premise that diarrhea is not an adverse effect in adults. Until now, the Agency has considered
some effects as adverse which, by themselves, are not harmful, but are precursors of adverse effects. Examples are
(a) developmental effects, such as an extra embryonic rib which is later resorbed; (b) benign tumors; (c) reduction
in maternal weight gain, even with no observable fetal effect; and (d) marginal cholinesterase inhibition. In comparison
to these effects, the long-term effects of sulfate ingestion appear to be nil, and acclimation occurs in a short period
of time. The other effects mentioned are only detected with scientific measurement, while diarrhea or loose stools
are readily observed by the person ingesting sulfate. EPA requests comment on whether transient bouts of diarrhea
should be considered an adverse health effect or simply an inconvenience in adults.

In addition, EPA requests comment on whether, given the available information, a conclusion can be made that experiencing
transient bouts of diarrhea resulting from ingestion of sulfate in drinking water is not an adverse effect in any segment
of the population (adults or infants) within the meaning of the Safe Drinking Water Act.

EPA also recognizes that the provisions of this regulation are more difficult to enforce than central treatment.
Indeed, it is for similar reasons that EPA has always prohibited Alternative Water as a means of compliance. While
PWSs already have the legal option to use a POE device to comply with any MCL if certain requirements are followed, the
requirements for using bottled water or POU devices have been applicable only to temporary situations to prevent
unreasonable risk to health. Adoption of any of the proposed options would also mean that individuals in the target
population would drink bottled water on a temporary basis. However, the extent to which bottled water quality (i.e.,
compliance with all MCLs) can be assured varies from State to State. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which
is responsible for overseeing bottled water quality, is continuing to adopt standards which ensure truthful labeling.
However, production and sales of bottled water have increased dramatically in recent years, and FDA does not have
a complete inventory of domestic bottled water plants. FDA inspects the known plants, on average, every three to four
years, or more frequently if problems arise (GAO, 1992). A few States have stricter standards than FDA (NY, CA, PA,
CT) and require all bottled water plants to register with the State and conform to State requirements.

Similarly, POU devices are not subject to EPA certification. Since the proposed rule gives the States full authority
to decide whether or not an alternative option would be allowed, each State would presumably base its decision on the
extent to which it believes implementation is practicable. EPA requests comment on whether it is appropriate to allow
use of bottled water and POU devices for sulfate MCL compliance.

f. 

Option 4.

 Because the proposed option (1) and its variations (2) and (3) represent a significant change in regulatory approach,
and in order to fully consider the issues raised, EPA considered another, more conventional option. Option 4 was considered
in the event EPA determines that Alternative Water may not be as effective as central treatment in enabling small systems
to comply with the sulfate MCL. Option 4 would not directly allow the use of Alternative Water as a means of compliance
with the MCL.

In Option 4, systems would need to obtain a variance from the sulfate MCL under the provisions of SDWA section 1415.
As a condition of receiving a variance, systems would be required to provide Alternative Water to their target populations,
just as in Option 1. Therefore, the relief under Option 4 would be similar to the relief under Option 1 but would be provided
through a different statutory mechanism.

<TEXT>
 

In Option 4, central treatment would be designated as section 1412 
BAT. Central treatment would be considered economically feasible despite 
the financial difficulties presented to small systems, because the SDWA 
legislative history indicates Congress' desire that economic feasibility be 
determined by reference to large metropolitan water systems. 
 

Section 1415 (and corresponding State laws) provide that systems 
may obtain a variance only after they have applied the designated BAT 
technology. However, section 1415 also states that the EPA Administrator 
may vary the technologies identified as BAT for purposes of section 1415 
variances ``depending on the number of persons served by the system or for 
other physical conditions related to engineering feasibility and costs of 
compliance with [MCLs] as considered appropriate by the Administrator.'' As 
a key component of Option 4, EPA would designate Alternative Water along 
with central treatment as BAT for purposes of section 1415 variances only. 
A PWS that is granted a variance would also be required to meet all of the 
requirements of Option 1 for public education/notification and provision of 
Alternative Water. 
 

Alternative Water would be designated as a section 1415 BAT because of the special need to provide bottled water which
complies with EPA MCLs only to targeted populations for a limited time, which represents a special ``physical condition
related to engineering feasibility'' under section 1415. To protect public health from the adverse effects of sulfate,
it is necessary to protect only these specific subpopulations (infants, travelers, and new residents). It is technically
infeasible to direct treated water only to those households containing these subpopulations, particularly when
various households contain sensitive subpopulations at different times. However, it is technically feasible to
direct public education and notification and Alternative Water only to those homes which require it. To treat water
going to households with sensitive subpopulations would require a PWS to treat all water. The cost of 
providing treated water to everyone could be much higher than the PWS would 
otherwise have to incur. 

Option 4 would require administrative involvement by the State in 
reviewing variance applications. The additional administrative burden is a 
clear disadvantage of this option, especially because many State agencies 
administering the drinking water program currently have significant funding 
and resource problems. On the other hand, a scheme based on individually 
granted variances might be considered more desirable in that each PWS would 
need to justify to the State its individual plan for providing Alternative 
Water. 
 
States may also choose to grant variances in a block to many PWSs at a time, thus reducing their own administrative burden.
However, the burden would remain on each system to make an application and present the details of its program to the
State. 

For the reasons stated above with respect to Option 1, EPA has decided not to limit the availability of variances based
on Alternative Water under Option 4 to smaller systems. The public education/notification requirements discussed
under Option 1 would apply to those systems receiving a variance under Option 4. 
 
Making relief available to small systems only through variances presents some additional statutory constraints
compared to Option 1. First, variances are only available at the discretion of the State. The State is free not to grant
variances or to issue them under more stringent conditions than set by EPA. For sulfate, based on the prior State comments
and input, States are seeking flexibility and relief for small systems and, therefore, might generally be expected
not to be more stringent on variances than EPA. On the other hand, it is unclear whether States will be dissuaded from
providing many variances by the administrative burdens presented by Option 4. 
 
Second, under section 1415, variances are available only where the State finds that they will not result in an unreasonable
risk to health (``URTH''). However, EPA does not believe that this constraint will present any problems since, as
a condition of receiving the variance, PWSs will be required to supply Alternative Water that complies with the sulfate
MCL. 
 
Third, section 1415 requires the State to prescribe with the variance a schedule for compliance with the MCL. In this
case, by providing Alternative Water to qualify for the variance, the PWS would in fact be supplying water that meets
the MCL. Therefore, EPA believes it is not necessary or appropriate to prescribe any further schedules for achieving
compliance with the sulfate MCL. 
 
Finally, EPA also notes that SDWA section 1415 provides for variances where a system cannot meet the MCL because of
characteristics of the raw water source. Here, the raw water source is not the issue; application of Alternative Water
as section 1415 BAT would achieve the MCL but would be considered not as effective as central treatment in ensuring
a consistent and reliable supply of water at the MCL. EPA nevertheless believes that Option 4 is consistent with the
purposes and intent of SDWA section 1415, but requests comment on this issue. 
 
As an additional option, EPA considered whether relief to small systems could be provided through exemptions under
SDWA section 1416. This does not appear to be a viable approach, however. Unlike section 1415, section 1416 does not
authorize EPA to vary its designation of BAT for purposes of exemptions. Instead, to qualify for indefinite exemptions,
section 1415 envisions that small systems will be continuously working toward obtaining the financing necessary
to install the BAT technologies identified under section 1412 (i.e., central treatment). Therefore, exemptions
do not appear to be an appropriate mechanism for providing relief from the sulfate MCL to small systems. EPA solicits
comment on whether exemptions do provide a mechanism for relief.

 
g. 

Additional option.

 The Agency requests comment on the feasibility and appropriateness of the Options discussed above. The Agency is
also considering an additional option, namely the traditional approach of simply relying on 
central treatment as BAT for all systems, with no special provisions for 
relief for small systems. The advantages to central treatment are that it 
is the easiest approach to enforce, and it is consistent with the Agency's 
regulatory approach for other contaminants. The disadvantages are that it 
is costly and would not provide flexibility or relief for small systems. 
In particular, under this option, drinking water that meets the sulfate MCL 
would need to be provided to all consumers even though only a small percentage of the population would experience adverse
health effects from ingesting sulfate. Also, the Agency has concerns that this option would not be economically feasible
for small systems, as discussed in section IV 
below. Accordingly, this option is not being offered as the preferred 
option in today's notice, but EPA is still considering it, and it has the 
potential to be adopted in the final rule. This option would be adopted, 
for example, if it appears that the other options would be inadequate to 
assure a supply of drinking water that dependably complies with the sulfate 
MCL (see  1401(1)(D) because members of the target population would fail to 
take appropriate action to protect themselves from an acute but temporary 
adverse health effect. The total national cost of this option would be 
identical to that for Option 4 ($147 million, see Table 8), since the 
economic analysis assumed that all systems would choose central treatment 
under Option 4. Similarly, the household cost for this option would be 
identical to those for Option 4 (Table 9). The Agency requests comment on 
whether this option, which would effectively limit methods of compliance to 
central treatment, should be adopted.

5. Compliance Monitoring Requirements 



a. 

Introduction.

 The proposed compliance monitoring requirements for sulfate would apply to all systems (community, non-transient
non-community, and transient non-community water systems). 
 
The occurrence of sulfate in drinking water may be predictable based on several factors including geological conditions,
use patterns (e.g., pesticides), presence of industrial activity in the area, and type of source or historic record.

 
PWSs would need to monitor for sulfate in accordance with EPA's Standard Monitoring Framework (SMF), published Jan.
30, 1991 (56 FR 3564). Monitoring is done for three, three-year compliance periods in a nine-year cycle. The Phase
II regulations established a nine-year cycle for those contaminants in that 

Federal Register

 notice. By agreement between States and EPA at a Denver work group meeting in 1992, subsequent rules will begin their
individual nine-year cycles in the first January after the effective date (18 months after promulgation). 


The monitoring requirements described in the next section are proposed to apply to systems which exceed the MCL and
are authorized by the State to select the preferred option (Option 1) to achieve compliance with the sulfate MCL. For
systems which select central treatment, or which do not exceed the MCL, the SMF is proposed to apply. If either Option
2 or Option 3 becomes the final regulation for sulfate and the State allows that method of compliance, the monitoring
requirements described for Option 1 regarding Alternative Water and the reporting/record keeping requirements
for public notification would apply for systems exceeding the sulfate MCL. Initial monitoring to determine MCL exceedence
would be required of all systems, that is, community, transient and non-transient, non-community systems. 
 
b. 

Proposed monitoring requirements for sulfate.

 The monitoring requirements for those systems selecting Option 1, with State authorization, would be as follows,
and are consistent with the provisions of  142.62 (g) and (h). 

(1) Bottled water. 
 
There are regulations in effect ( 142.62) which state that a PWS can be required or permitted by the State to supply
its customers with bottled water as a condition for receiving a variance or exemption. These regulations indicate
that the State shall require and approve a monitoring program for bottled water and that the PWS shall develop and put
in place a monitoring program that provides reasonable assurances that the bottled water meets all MCLs. These same
monitoring requirements are proposed to apply here. The PWS monitors a representative sample of the bottled water
for all contaminants regulated under   141.61 (a) and (c) and 141.62 during the first three-month period
that it supplies the bottled water to the public, and annually thereafter. Results of the monitoring are provided
to the State annually. 
 
The State, in lieu of the above requirements, could accept certification from the bottled water company that the bottled
water supplied has come from an approved source as defined in 21 CFR 129.3(a); and that the bottled water company has
conducted monitoring in accordance with 21 CFR 129.80(g) (1) through (3); and that the bottled water does not exceed
any EPA MCLs. The PWS would have to provide certification to the State the first quarter after it supplies bottled water
and annually thereafter. At the State's option a PWS may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by citing an approved
monitoring program which is already in place in another State.

<TEXT>
 

The existing regulations regarding interim use of bottled water 
to avoid an unreasonable risk to health state that the PWS is fully 
responsible for the provision of sufficient quantities of bottled water to 
every customer via door-to-door delivery. The Option being proposed today 
(Option 1) would similarly require door-to-door delivery by the PWS to 
persons in the target population when the sulfate MCL is exceeded. EPA 
requests comment on whether this door-to-door delivery requirement is 
appropriate for the sulfate rulemaking, or whether the requirements should 
be more flexible. For example, several possible means of delivery might be 
allowed. Distribution points could be authorized to stock and supply 
bottled water to the target population, with coupons issued to consumers in 
the target population redeemable at the distribution point. PWSs supplying 
bottled water to households would deliver that water upon request and free 
of charge, except as discussed under III.B.4.c. above. EPA requests comment 
on the degree of flexibility needed in the mechanism for delivery of 
bottled water that meets the sulfate MCL. 
(2) POU/POE devices. 
The existing regulations for variance and exemption conditions 
( 142.62) also describe the requirements for allowing a PWS to use POU or 
POE devices. These regulations state that it is the responsibility of the 
PWS to operate and maintain the POU and/or POE treatment system. Before 
POU or POE devices are installed, the PWS obtains the primacy agent's 
approval of a monitoring plan which ensures that the devices provide health 
protection to the target population equivalent to that provided by central 
treatment. The PWS must apply effective technology under a State-approved 
plan. The microbiological safety of the water must be maintained at all 
times. The State must require certification of adequate performance, field 
testing, and if not included in the certification process, an engineering 
design review of the POU/POE devices. Under  142.62(h), the design and 
application of the POU/POE devices must consider the potential for 
increasing concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria in water treated with 
activated carbon. The State must be assured that buildings connected to 
the system have sufficient POU or POE devices that are properly installed, 
maintained, and monitored such that all consumers will be protected. 
The existing regulations described above would be applied in both 
Options 1 and 4. EPA assumes that only Options 1 and 4 would entail the 
use of POU/POE devices, since in Options 2 and 3, bottled water would 
likely be more cost-effective, given the reduced target population. The 
Agency seeks comment on whether all of these existing requirements should 
be proposed in the case of sulfate MCL exceedence, or whether more flexible 
requirements would be appropriate. For example, if recordkeeping could 
demonstrate that an effective maintenance program was in place to ensure 
the proper functioning of the treatment equipment and compliance with the 
MCL, some reduction in monitoring might be foreseen. The efficiency or 
longevity of certain types of POU or POE devices might also be considered. 
(3) Effective Dates for Initial Monitoring. 
Initial monitoring for all systems would begin in the first 
January after the effective date of the rule. EPA's issuance of the final 
sulfate rule is scheduled for May 1996. The effective date will be 18 
months after the promulgation of the final rule, or November of 1997. If 
this schedule is maintained, the initial monitoring for sulfate would begin 
in January 1998 for all systems. 
(4) Sampling Location. 
Under the proposed regulation, both ground water and surface water 
systems would take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the 
distribution system which is representative of each well or source after 
treatment. The number of samples a system must take will be determined by 
the number of entry points. This will make it easier to pinpoint possible 
contaminated sources (wells) within a system. In both surface and ground 
water systems, the system shall take each sample at the same sampling point 
unless conditions make another sampling point more representative of each 
source or treatment plant. 
(5) Monitoring Frequency. 
Surface water systems would be required to monitor annually and 
ground water systems would sample every three years. Systems which comply 
by Option 1 would not be required to continue monitoring the water in the 
distribution system for sulfate. That water may continue to exceed the 
sulfate MCL, but the PWS would be in compliance by providing Alternative 
Water and public notification to target populations. However, the water 
would still have to be monitored for and meet MCLs for other contaminants. 
(6) Public Notice Requirements. 
EPA proposes that PWSs who use central treatment and who are 
nevertheless not in compliance with the sulfate MCL would be subject to the 
public notification requirements in  141.32. However, the Agency recognizes 
that having different public education/notification requirements for those 
systems choosing central treatment and those choosing Option 1 may create 
confusion, and seeks comment on this issue. 
For PWSs authorized by the State to use whichever option (1 
through 4) is promulgated in the final sulfate rule, public notification 
requirements are proposed to be those described in section III.B.4.b.3 of 
this Notice. 
c. 

State Implementation.

 The Act provides that States may assume primary implementation and enforcement responsibilities for the PWS program
(primacy). 40 CFR part 
142 contains EPA's primacy regulations. In States or tribal governments 
where EPA has direct implementation, resource constraints make it unlikely 
that the Agency would offer the alternative options (1 through 4, whichever 
is promulgated) to systems. EPA Regional Offices will, however, have the 
discretion to consider particular circumstances in their decision about 
whether or not to offer and implement the alternative option. The Agency 
assumes that most States with primacy would offer the alternative option, 
but requests comment on this issue. 
Fifty-five out of 57 jurisdictions have applied for and 
received primacy under the Act. To implement the federal regulations for 
drinking water contaminants, States must have legal authorities which are 
at least as stringent as the federal regulations. To update their programs, 
States must comply with the requirements in 40 CFR 142.12 on revising 
approved primacy programs. This proposal describes the regulations and 
other procedures and policies States would need to adopt or have in place 
to implement the new regulations for sulfate. 
Under this proposal, States would be required to adopt the 
following requirements: Modifications to  141.23, Inorganic Chemical 
Sampling and Analytical Requirements,  141.32, Public Notification 
Requirements (i.e., mandatory health effects language to be included in 
public notification or violations), and  141.62(b), Maximum Contaminant 
Levels for Inorganic Contaminants, where sulfate has been added to the 
list. 
In addition to adopting drinking water provisions no less 
stringent than the federal regulations listed above, EPA is proposing to 
allow States to adopt certain requirements related to this regulation in 
order to have their program revision application approved by EPA. This rule 
proposes to provide flexibility to the State with regard to implementation 
of the monitoring requirements for sulfate depending on whether a system 
chooses central treatment or the alternative method of compliance 
promulgated in the final rule. In all cases, States would decide and 
inform PWSs as to whether the alternative method of compliance (referred to 
as Option 1 for simplicity) promulgated in the final sulfate rule will be 
allowed. Specifically, States would be authorized to offer Option 1 as a 
means of compliance to PWSs who exceed the sulfate MCL. Under Option 1, 
the State would need to approve the monitoring plan of a PWS that chooses 
the Alternative Water and public education/notification as a means of 
compliance. The requirements would be as follows: 
(1) State Primacy Requirements. 
To ensure that the State program includes all the elements 
necessary for an effective and enforceable program, the State's request for 
approval must include a plan that each system monitor for sulfate by the 
end of each compliance period. If the State is planning to authorize PWSs 
to use Option 1, it would need to submit the text of State laws requiring 
the Alternative Water and public notification/education program, and a 
description of the State's plan to oversee compliance of the program. 
States planning to issue monitoring waivers would do so according to the 
requirements of  142.16.

<TEXT>
 

(2) State Recordkeeping Requirements. 
The State shall keep a record of PWSs choosing to use Option 1 to 
comply. If the State has authorized Option 1, PWSs would be required to 
notify the State within 30 days of reporting a sulfate MCL exceedence, of 
its decision on whether to use Option 1 or other means of achieving 
compliance. 
(3) State Reporting Requirements. 
The quarterly report shall include all systems that have violated 
the sulfate MCL, and those which the State has authorized to use Option 1. 
d. 

Variances and Exemptions. 

Option 4 offers relief to small systems in the form of an alternative to centralized treatment. If a system in violation
of the 
sulfate MCL chooses centralized treatment but for some reason cannot 
achieve compliance, the system would apply to the Primacy Agent for a 
variance, and the conditions of the variance would be the same elements 
described for Option 1. 


(1) Variances 


Under section 1415(a)(1)(A) of the SDWA, EPA or a State with 
primacy may grant variances from MCLs to those public water systems that 
cannot comply with the MCLs because of characteristics of their water 
sources. At the time a variance is granted, the State must prescribe a 
compliance schedule and may require the system to implement additional 
control measures. The SDWA requires that variances may only be granted to 
those systems that have installed BAT (as identified by EPA). However, in 
limited situations a system may receive a variance if it demonstrates that 
the BAT would only achieve a 

de minimis

 reduction in contamination (see 
 142.62(d)). Before EPA or a State issues a variance, it must find that the 
variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to health (URTH). In 
general, the URTH level would reflect acute and subchronic toxicity for 
short-term exposures and high carcinogenic risks for long-term exposures. 
For sulfate EPA's guidance regarding what is an URTH level is set at the 
MCL because sulfate has an acute adverse health effect. For the sulfate 
variance, if the PWS provides public education/notification and Alternative 
Water, EPA believes that the State should be able to conclude that the PWS 
will not be considered to exceed an URTH because those actions are 
considered protective of public health. 
Under section 1413(a)(4) of the Act, States with primacy that 
choose to issue variances must do so under conditions and in a manner that 
is no less stringent than EPA allows under section 1415. 
The Act permits EPA to vary the BAT established under section 1415 
from that established under section 1412 based on a number of findings such 
as system size, physical conditions related to engineering feasibility, and 
the cost of compliance. Paragraph 142.62 of this proposed rule lists the 
BAT that EPA has specified under section 1415 of the Act for the purposes 
of issuing variances. The variance BAT is Alternative Water and public 
education/notification. 


(2) Exemptions 


Under section 1416(a), a State or EPA may grant an exemption 
extending deadlines for compliance with a treatment technique or MCL if it 
finds that: 
(a) Due to compelling factors (which may include economic 
factors), the PWS is unable to comply with the requirement; 
(b) The exemption will not result in an URTH; and 
(c) The system was in operation on the effective date of the 
NPDWR, or, for a system not in operation on that date, that no reasonable 
alternative source of drinking water is available to the new system. 
In determining whether to grant an exemption, EPA expects the 
State to determine whether the facility could be consolidated with another 
system or whether an alternative source could be developed. Another 
compelling factor is the affordability of the required treatments. It is 
possible that very small systems may not be able to consolidate or find a 
low-cost treatment. EPA's analysis of cost for the proposed sulfate rule 
shows that, for very small systems, the cost is lower to provide public 
education/notification, and Alternative Water than to provide central 
treatment. Thus, EPA believes this alternative BAT is affordable for these 
systems. 
As discussed above, granting exemptions under SDWA section 1416 
does not appear to be a viable approach to providing relief from the 
sulfate MCL for smaller systems. Unlike section 1415 for variances, section 
1416 does not authorize EPA to vary its designation of BAT for purposes of 
exemptions. 


IV. Economic Analysis


A. Executive Order 12866 


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 
1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is 
``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of 
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as 
one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more 
or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, 
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, 
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an 
action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact on entitlements, grants, 
user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients 
thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the 
Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been 
determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because it 
proposes a means of MCL compliance that is unique in its attempt to limit 
protection only to the affected populations. As such, this action was 
submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions 
or recommendations will be documented in the public record. 
EPA prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for this rule, 
titled the Regulatory Impact Analysis of Sulfate (August 30, 1994). The 
analysis used the following data, where available, for sulfate:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941220-1-00045 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941220-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Occurrence data to determine the number of systems exceeding the MCL; 
 Treatment and waste disposal cost data and corresponding selection probabilities to estimate the system
level and aggregate costs of achieving the proposed MCL; and 
 Monitoring costs to estimate aggregate costs of the 
 monitoring requirements. 
Occurrence data adequate to determine the number of systems 
exceeding the proposed MCL are available for sulfate. Table 7 indicates 
the number of systems in several system size categories expected to be out 
of compliance with the proposed MCL of 500 mg/L. 




B. National Costs of the Proposed Rule 


Under Option 1, annualized national treatment and waste disposal 
cost is projected to total $86 million for the proposed MCL of 500 mg/L, of 
which $8 million is estimated for monitoring and State implementation. 
With State authorization, the 1,500 systems assumed to choose public 
notification/education and Alternative Water account for $7 million of the 
total, or about $5,000 per system. The Agency assumes that, despite the 
availability of Option 1, 25% of the systems (approximately 500) exceeding 
the sulfate MCL would choose either central treatment or regionalization, 
for a total cost of $71 million. Possible reasons for choosing central 
treatment would be to avoid a permanent requirement for public 
notification/Alternative Water provision and its associated administrative 
and logistical costs and activities, or to comply with other existing or 
future regulations on other contaminants. The difference in cost to large 
systems choosing central treatment rather than Option 1 is a factor of 
approximately 3 to 5. EPA assumes that this additional cost would not 
dissuade large systems from choosing central treatment. For costing 
purposes, it was assumed that all transient systems not choosing central 
treatment would install a POE device, and all CWS and NTNC systems not 
choosing central treatment would use bottled water or POU devices. In 
reality, the Agency recognizes that there would be a mixture of choices 
among system types, and that the choice of a POE by a small system 
constitutes ``central treatment'' for that system, since all water is treated 
and the technology used for the POE would be a BAT technology such as RO. 
Small transient systems could legally choose a POE device under any of the 
proposed options, and since their cost cannot be counted under both 
centralized treatment and Option 1, their costs have been included under 
the heading ``non-centralized treatment''. 
Under Options 2 and 3, the total cost of the rule is approximately 
$16 million, which also includes $8 million for State implementation and 
monitoring costs. The implementation of Options 2/3 would be much less 
costly than Option 1, but would involve all 2,000 systems, compared to the 
1,500 systems which would choose public notification/education and 
Alternative Water in Option 1. Consequently, the cost of implementation 
would be $8 million rather than the $7 million for Option 1. The target 
population would be reduced to infants and the water allocated reduced to 1 
liter per day. Although more infants would be included by large systems 
choosing this option, infants comprise less than 2% of the population at 
any given time. The difference in cost to large systems choosing central 
treatment rather than Options 2/3 would be at least an order of magnitude. 
EPA assumes that this additional cost would dissuade large systems from 
choosing central treatment, and therefore that all systems would choose 
Option 1. Implementation of Options 2 and 3 would be identical, except for 
the content of the public education/notification. 
Under Option 4, the total national cost of the rule is $147 
million. For costing purposes, it was assumed that all systems would 
install central treatment, rather than request a variance. For some of the 
smallest systems, the central treatment installed consists of a POE device, 
which functions on the same principles as a treatment plant (e.g., reverse 
osmosis). Since some percentage of systems would, in reality, request a 
variance and comply by public notification/education and Alternative Water 
provision, the cost for Option 4 is somewhat of an overestimate. At the 
same time the cost for Option 4 is an accurate estimate of what the cost 
would be for central treatment for all affected systems. 
Under all options, approximately 2,000 systems, most serving 
populations less than 500, are expected to exceed the sulfate MCL. 


1. Assumptions Used To Estimate Costs 


For each system size category, for both ground and surface water 
systems, the projected number of systems with contamination above the 
sulfate proposed MCL was determined from the occurrence data. The number of 
systems exceeding the MCL was then merged with a compliance decision 
matrix, which gave the relative likelihood that a given system would choose 
various treatment, compliance and waste disposal options. 
For systems choosing central treatment, the resulting estimates 
were then multiplied by the unit engineering costs, which include both 
capital and O&M costs. Although pre-treatment costs were included in the 
estimates, the operation of reverse osmosis by some systems with very high 
influent sulfate levels may contribute to the need for additional post-treatment corrosion control to comply with
the lead and copper rule. This 
would likely affect only systems with influent sulfate concentrations above 
750 mg/L because more than one-third of the influent stream would be 
treated. These costs would be added to the costs of the BAT, but would not 
affect EPA's conclusions on affordability because they would be 
insignificant compared to the overall costs of the central treatment 
technology. 
For the purposes of cost estimation, the Agency assumed that the 
cost of either POU or POE is the same. Each system is assumed to install 
POE, since the cost of one POE is generally less than the cost of multiple 
POU units. For example, in a gas station, a POU unit would be needed at 
the men's restroom, the women's restroom and the water fountain in the 
public area. In this scenario, it might be cost-effective to install one 
POE unit versus three POU devices. Several sources were used to estimate 
the capital and O&M costs for POU/POE units, including (1) ``Point-Of-Use 
Treatment of Drinking Water in San Ysidro, New Mexico;'' March, 1990; (2) 
National Network for Environmental Management Studies Research Report on 
Affordable Drinking Water Treatment for PWSs Contaminated by Excess Levels 
of Natural Fluoride;'' December, 1991; and (3) ``Very Small Systems Best 
Available Technology Document;'' First Draft; September, 1993. The 
calculations included some of the following assumptions: 
(1) Laboratory costs including four bacteriological analyses and two sulfate 
analyses per year. 
(2) The replacement frequency for both the particulate filter and the carbon 
post filter is assumed to be twice per year. 
(3) The purchase price for the POU devices ranges from $329 to $665 
depending on the number purchased at one time. 
(4) The cost for installation is assumed to be $79. 
(5) The cost for a one year maintenance service contract is assumed to be 
$508 per unit. 
Bottled water costs are based on data provided by the 
International Bottled Water Association. The cost includes cost of water, 
delivery, and labor. Water is estimated at $1.06 per gallon. People are 
assumed to consume 0.53 gallons per day. The Agency estimated 1 delivery 
per week with a round trip distance of 25 miles costing $0.28 cents per 
mile. The Agency also estimated one hour for each delivery at a labor rate 
of $14.70 per hour. For Options 2 and 3, where bottled water is provided 
only to infants, the water allocation is one liter per day.

The Agency used Federal Reporting Data System (FRDS) data to 
determine how many people lived in an average system in each system size 
category. EPA used U.S. Census Bureau population and fertility data to 
estimate that 1.68% of the people were infants and 16.4% of the people were 
new residents. Recent census data put the average number of people per 
household at 2.6. The number of travelers needing Alternative Water 
was derived from information from the National Travel Data Center that 
there are approximately 1.27 billion person-trips made nationally each 
year. The number of traveling persons exposed is calculated by multiplying 
the estimated 250 million people served by all water systems with the 
probability that a traveler will visit a system with water containing 
sulfate levels exceeding the MCL. The probability that a traveler will 
visit such a system is calculated by dividing the resident population in a 
given system size category by the total resident population of all systems. 
This value is then multiplied by the number of person trips and divided by 
five (the number of person trips per year per traveler) to get the 
population of exposed travelers in that size category. The resulting 
estimate is that approximately 1 million travelers are exposed to sulfate 
in excess of 500 mg/L. 
For the public education and notification requirements, the PWS is 
responsible for producing and delivering pamphlets according to EPA's 
public notification guidelines. The number of pamphlets needed per size 
category is calculated based on the population served by the PWS. Larger 
population centers will contain more medical facilities. For example, if 
size category 1 (25-100 people) serves 0.03% of the total population, it 
is also assumed to serve 0.03% of the nation's 6,634 hospitals, 83,425 
schools, and so on. The number of permanent signs per system is calculated 
by taking the number of hotels, campgrounds, interstate rest areas, rest 
rooms in restaurants and gas stations in the nation and multiplying by the 
percent of population served by each size category. 
The national annualized cost of the rule for the four options is 
shown in Table 8. 



 
 
2. Costs to Households 


Table 9 illustrates estimated household costs for the options 
being considered. For costing purposes, it was assumed that all systems 
were community water systems, since transient systems do not have 
households. For Option 1, costs increase for systems serving populations 
greater than 3,300 due to the fact that most of those systems would choose 
central treatment. Costs level off and decrease for systems serving 
populations greater than 10,000 due to economies of scale. 




On the basis of these estimated costs, EPA concludes that the 
options being considered would be economically feasible, and requests 
comment on this conclusion. 


3. Assumptions Used to Estimate Benefits 


The Agency made assumptions for estimating the benefits of 
diarrhea cases avoided which included affected population, costs of medical 
care, and value of days lost to care givers, business travelers and 
vacationers.

It is estimated that approximately 1.2 million people will have 
reduced exposure to sulfates as a result of PWSs' compliance with the 
sulfate MCL. The low and high estimates of reduced population exposure, 
based on uncertainty in occurrence data, are 0.9 million and 1.7 million 
people, respectively. 
Evaluating benefits is limited to estimating reduced population 
exposure because there are inadequate dose-response data to estimate cases 
of adverse health effects avoided. Consequently, potential benefits per 
case of diarrhea avoided are estimated rather than total benefits. Exposed 
population is usually calculated by multiplying the number of systems 
failing the MCL by the average population served by each system. A 
different approach was used for sulfate, since only unacclimated persons 
and infants are affected. The affected population is in areas served by 
systems with sulfate levels of 500 mg/L or more, and includes resident 
infants under one year of age, travellers, including infants, of all ages 
visiting the area, new residents and houseguests that stay with residents. 
Infants were assumed to accompany parents on pleasure trips but not on 
business trips. Sources of population data were the National Travel Data 
Center and the U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Reports and fertility 
statistics. The Agency used the 1991 census data for the number of infants 
born in a year. The number of persons exposed is calculated by multiplying 
the estimated 250 million people served by all water systems with the 
probability that the average traveler will visit a system with elevated 
sulfate levels. The Agency used the National Travel Data Center estimate of 
approximately 1.27 billion person-trips made nationally each year for 
travelers. The number of diarrhea cases avoided is based on the estimate of 
person-trips because each un-acclimatized individual is assumed to face 
multiple exposures to sulfate and potentially contract diarrhea more than 
once a year. 
This estimate of people exposed has uncertainty based on two 
variables: the number of systems with elevated sulfate levels, and the data 
used to model the traveling population. The best estimate of the number of 
travellers and resident infants with reduced exposure to sulfate at an MCL 
of 500 mg/L is 1.2 million people (including 27,000 infants). A logistic 
response function was used to characterize the statistical relationship 
between sulfate levels in drinking water and the probability of an exposed 
individual experiencing a laxative effect. One weakness of this approach 
is that it assumes that consumption of either sodium sulfate or magnesium 
sulfate results in equivalent laxative effects. It has been reported that 
magnesium sulfate is a better purgative than sodium sulfate. 
Uncertainty is also associated with the lack of toxicological data 
on the relationship between various sulfate levels and the resulting 
laxative effect. There are insufficient data to plot a dose-response 
function. As a result, the Agency is limiting its estimate of benefits to 
an individual case basis. 
The assumptions made in estimating benefits on a case by case 
basis are shown in Table 10. The value of an outpatient case in Table 10 is 
between $218-$273. For example, the value of a case of diarrhea in a 
resident infant who is not hospitalized would be $55+$11 for the doctor 
and medication, plus 8 hours of the care giver's time ($19 x 8=$152), 
since it is assumed the caretaker would miss work. The total value for the 
case is $66+$152=$218. An additional $55 would be added in the case of 
a traveling infant for hotel and travel expenses lost. The range accounts 
for the difference between residents and travelers. The infant 
hospitalization cases cost between $3,608 and $3,828 per case. The Agency 
is requesting comment on the assumptions used in the analysis of the 
benefits of the proposed rule.

C. Comparison to Earlier Proposed Rule 


The 1990 proposed rule estimated the cost for central treatment to 
be $65 million (excluding monitoring costs). There were assumed to be 1350 
systems which would need to treat for sulfate. For this reproposal EPA 
updated the cost to $139 million (excluding State and monitoring costs). 
The increase in cost is due to: (1) The increase in projected number of 
systems that would exceed the sulfate MCL from 1350 to 1950, (2) change in 
the interest rate from 3% to 7%, and (3) updating for 1991 dollars. 
Although the new occurrence information was taken primarily 
from the National Inorganics and Radionuclides Survey (NIRS), EPA 
complemented that information with sampling data from New York, Utah, South 
Dakota, North Dakota and New Jersey. Because of the new occurrence 
information, the number of systems has gone up from 1350 to 1950. Another 
reason for the increase is EPA's modification, as a result of research for 
the upcoming regulation concerning the control of radionuclides in drinking 
water, of the number of treatment sites per ground water system. Ground 
water systems frequently contain more than one site requiring treatment 
because wells are typically not piped to a central source. EPA has 
incorporated this estimation method for all systems served by ground water. 


D. Annual Burden to PWSS and States 


EPA estimates that the cost of sulfate regulation to State 
programs will be $7 million per year. Table 11 illustrates the 18-year 
average annual national burden hours, responses and costs to PWSs and 
States. Sulfate testing does not require special laboratory equipment. 
Therefore, it is assumed that laboratory expansion undertaken to implement 
the Phase II and Phase V regulations will largely satisfy the monitoring 
needs of this rule. On the other hand, EPA recognizes that States are 
likely to provide more technical assistance to systems than for an average 
contaminant because of the unique nature of Option 1. Total annual costs 
are estimated to be $10.6 million. The additional public reporting burden 
on PWSs for this collection of information is estimated to average 8.6 
hours per response.

V. Summary of Selected Issues




EPA is soliciting public comment and scientific information on all 
issues presented in or pertaining to this proposed sulfate regulation. In 
particular, EPA requests comments on the following: 
(1) Is there a correlation between sulfate concentrations, palatability and 
consumption of high-sulfate water by the public? 
(2) Are there new data in support of or opposing the reproposed MCLG of 500 
mg/L? Are there new data in support of a higher MCLG? 
(3) Are there data to support or refute the hypothesis that the decrease in 
available water resulting from sulfate ingestion may result in dehydration 
in adults or infants? 
(4) Are reverse osmosis, ion exchange and electrodialysis reversal 
appropriate technologies for sulfate removal? 
(5) Should a higher PQL of 30 mg/L be set in order to retain the 
colorimetric method of analysis? 
(6) Are the allotted time periods for provision of Alternative Water, i.e., 
20 weeks for infants within the first year of life and 6 weeks for new 
residents and travelers, appropriate and protective? 
(7) What should be the means of compliance for unmanned, remote campgrounds 
in the national parks system, particularly in regard to the provision of 
Alternative Water? 
(8) What types of Alternative Water would be likely to be chosen by public 
water systems of various types and sizes? 
(9) Are the compliance requirements, that is, Alternative Water and public 
notification, sufficiently protective of the sensitive population? 
(10) Should the target population be limited just to infants, or should 
there be different requirements for protecting infants and adults? 
(11) Are the proposed options consistent with the purposes and intent of 
SDWA, and are they feasible? 
(12) Is a provision to allow the water supply to exceed the sulfate MCL 
while relying on public notification and self-protection appropriate under 
SDWA? 
(13) Is the need for assertive action on the part of the public for self-
protection appropriate? 
(14) Should temporary diarrhea be considered an adverse health effect in 
adults or infants? 
(15) Would exemptions provide a mechanism for relief to smaller systems? 
(16) Should compliance be limited to central treatment? 
(17) Is it appropriate under SDWA to allow the use of bottled water and POU 
devices for sulfate MCL compliance? 
(18) What degree of flexibility is appropriate in the bottled water 
monitoring requirements and delivery mechanism? 
(19) In Options 1 and 4, should all the existing regulations regarding use 
of POU and POE devices be imposed in the case of sulfate levels higher than 
the MCL, or are more flexible requirements appropriate? 
(20) Should the generic public notice requirements applicable to variances 
under  141.32 apply under Option 4 to systems who choose central treatment, 
in lieu of the public notice requirements proposed in Option 1? 
(21) Are the assumptions used in the analysis of the costs and benefits of 
the proposed rule reasonable? 
(22) What flexibility is appropriate or practical in regard to the 
maintenance of POU/POE devices installed to comply with the sulfate MCL? 
What flexibility is appropriate regarding a reduction in monitoring if 
certain types of POU/POE devices were installed? 
(23) Would most States offer the alternative option to PWS as a means of 
compliance? 



VI. Other Requirements




A. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 




The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) calls for 
the Agency to consider the potential impacts of proposed regulations on 
small businesses, organizations and government jurisdictions. If an 
analysis shows that regulations would have a significant impact on a 
substantial number (usually taken as at least 20 percent) of small 
entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA) must be prepared. 
In an RFA, an agency examines ``any significant alternatives to the proposed 
rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes and 
which minimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on 
small entities'' (Regulatory Flexibility Act section 603). 


Today's proposed regulation would affect less than 2,000, or one 
percent, of the total of 200,000 public water systems (including all 
community and non-community systems). Nevertheless, EPA's analysis shows 
that regulating sulfate through standard approaches that assume the need 
for central treatment would have significant economic impacts that would 
fall largely on smaller public water systems. Therefore, EPA has conducted 
a regulatory flexibility analysis by investigating alternative, less 
burdensome regulatory approaches for those small systems. From these 
investigations, EPA developed and is considering the innovative options for 
regulating sulfate described earlier in this notice. These innovative 
options accomplish the Regulatory Flexibility Act's goal of minimizing the 
impacts of this regulation on small public water systems while meeting the 
objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act by ensuring that drinking water 
that meets the sulfate MCL will be provided to all persons within the 
target population.

B. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have 
been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
under the 

Paperwork Reduction Act 

(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). An Information 
Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by EPA(ICR No. 270.34) 
and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; 
EPA; 401 M Street, SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by 
calling (202) 260-2740. 

This collection of information has an estimated annual reporting 
and recordkeeping burden averaging 9.3 hours per respondent. These 
estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data 
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and 
reviewing the collection of information. National annual burden and cost 
estimates for PWSs and States are presented in Table 11. 

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of 
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this 
burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M Street, SW. (Mail 
Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget; Washington, DC 20503, 
marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA''. The final rule will respond to 
any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements 
contained in this proposal. 



C. Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership 



Executive Order 12875, Enhancing Intergovernmental Partnerships 
explicitly requires Federal agencies to consult with State, local, and 
tribal entities in the development of rules and policies that will affect 
them. EPA has complied with the Order in proposing the sulfate rule in the 
following ways. 

First, the Agency met with interested parties, including 
representatives from four States, Region 8, and the Association of State 
Drinking Water Administrators in Denver, Colorado in November, 1992. 

Secondly, the Agency plans to meet with the National Drinking 
Water Advisory Council (NDWAC), a group composed of representatives from 
State, local and tribal governments in addition to water suppliers and 
environmentalists. 

Thirdly, the Agency is developing generic contacts with State, 
Tribal and local fiscal and program officials which will enable various 
programs to consult with affected parties in a coordinated fashion. 
Identification of appropriate contacts was not accomplished in a time frame 
which enabled EPA's Office of Water to have extensive consultation with 
affected parties in compliance with the E.O. before proposal. However, a 
contact person has now been designated from ASDWA, and the Agency will be 
meeting with this designee and other interested State officials. EPA is 
committed to expanded dialogue and collaboration with State, Tribal and 
local governments. EPA will schedule a work group or public meeting to 
solicit comments of fiscal and program officials or State, Tribal and local 
governments. The intent of such a meeting is to allow for the maximum 
input from the regulated community for the drafting of the final rule. 
EPA will also send copies of this proposed rule to these governmental 
bodies, as well as to national and local associations (e.g., the 
Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, the National League of 
Cities, the National Association of Towns and Townships, the National 
Association of County Health Officers, etc.)

(r)(1) 

Compliance with the MCL for Sulfate.

 (i) PWSs subject to the sulfate MCL established under  141.62(b) shall demonstrate compliance with the sulfate
MCL. If authorized by the State to do so, PWSs may choose to comply in one of the following two ways: 
(A) The PWS shall demonstrate compliance by achieving the MCL in 
samples taken at each entry point to the distribution system; or 
(B) The PWS shall demonstrate compliance by meeting the 
requirements of   141.23(r)(2) and (3) (program for providing 
Alternative Water to Target Populations and providing public 
notification and education). The requirements of   141.23(r)(2) 
and (3), taken together, are termed the ``Alternative Method of 
Compliance.'' However, the availability of the Alternative Method 
of Compliance is limited by paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section.

(ii) The State has the option of whether or not to allow PWSs to 
demonstrate compliance through the Alternative Method of Compliance. Where 
the State has chosen not to allow the Alternative Method of Compliance, 
PWSs shall demonstrate compliance by achieving the MCL in samples taken at 
each entry point to the distribution system. 
(iii) Where EPA is the primacy agent, the Regional Administrator may 
authorize PWSs to demonstrate compliance through the Alternative Method of 
Compliance. In determining whether to authorize the use of the Alternative 
Method of Compliance, the Regional Administration in its sole discretion 
may consider the availability of regional resources, and whether it is 
reasonable and practical for the Regional Office to oversee implementation 
of the Alternative Method of Compliance. If the Regional Administrator 
authorizes the Alternative Method of Compliance, each PWS shall have the 
option to comply either by achieving the MCL in samples taken at each entry 
point to the distribution system or through the Alternative Method of 
Compliance. 
(iv) Until such time as notified by the State or Primacy Agency that the 
Alternative Method of Compliance will be authorized, PWSs shall be required 
to achieve the MCL at each entry point to the distribution system. 
(v) The general prohibition on the use of bottled water and point-of-use 
devices in 40 CFR 141.101 shall not apply to PWSs that choose to achieve 
compliance with the MCL for sulfate by meeting the requirements of the 
Alternative Method of Compliance. 
(vi) A PWS must report failure to comply with a NPDWR to the State under 
the requirements of 40 CFR 141.31. Within 30 days of notifying the State 
of failure to comply with the sulfate MCL, the PWS shall notify the State 
as to which of the two methods of compliance,  141.23(r)(1)(i) (A) or (B), 
the PWS intends to use to return to compliance with the sulfate MCL. 
(2) 

Alternative Water Supplied to Target Populations. 

 The requirements of this subsection apply only to a PWS that has chosen to comply with the MCL for sulfate through the
Alternative Method of Compliance instead of by achieving the MCL in samples taken at each entry point to the distribution
system. 
(i) 

Definitions.

 (A) 

Alternative water: 

For purposes of this section, a PWS supplies Alternative Water when it supplies either bottled water or water that
has been treated with a POU or POE device (as defined in  141.2).
(B) 

Target population, 

for purposes of this section, means all infants, travelers and new residents within the PWS's service area, according
to the following: 
(1) For the purposes of this rule, 

infant

 is defined as persons under the age of 12 months. 
(2) 

Transients

 means visitors from outside the service area, vacation travelers and business travelers.
 
(3) 

New residents

 means persons who have resided in the service area for no more than six weeks. 
(ii) Community water systems shall maintain a record of all requests for 
Alternative Water. Records shall include the name and address of the 
person requesting the water, date of request, date of delivery requested, 
date of delivery and quantity of water delivered (or date of installation 
in the case of a POU/POE device). This record shall be maintained for five 
years from the time of recording. 
(iii) Community water systems shall supply Alternative Water in compliance 
with this subsection to the Target Population for the time periods 
described under paragraph (r)(2)(vii) of this section. Transient water 
systems and non-transient, non-community systems shall have alternative 
water available for infants, travelers, newcomers and visitors. 
(iv) Community water systems shall provide door-to-door delivery of the 
bottled water or installation of POU or POE devices upon request to 
customers who are within the Target Population. The PWS shall have the 
option of deciding whether to provide a customer with bottled water or 
POU/POE devices. 
(v) 

Bottled water requirements.

 (A) 

Quality.

 Bottled water provided by the PWS shall meet the requirements of  142.62 (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this chapter. 
(B) 

Quantity. 

Community water systems shall have bottled water 
available and delivered at the level of two liters per day for 
each person within the Target Population for whom bottled water is 
requested (unless the customer requests a lesser amount). 
Transient water systems and non-transient, non-community systems 
shall have sufficient bottled water to serve the transient 
population, unless POE or POU devices are installed. 
(C) 

Time of delivery.

 Community water systems shall deliver the 
bottled water within 24 hours of the request, or on the date requested, whichever is later. 
(vi) 

POU and POE device requirements.

 PWSs that choose POU or POE devices as a method of compliance shall meet the following requirements: 
(A) PWSs that choose POE devices as a method of compliance shall 
meet the requirements of  141.100 (a) through (d). 
(B) If the PWS decides to provide a POE/POU device and is unable 
to install such equipment within 24 hours of the request, or on 
the date requested, the PWS shall provide bottled water to the 
target population during the interim time period between the time 
of the request and the time of installation of the POU/POE device. 
(C) PWSs that choose POU devices as a method of compliance shall 
obtain the approval of a monitoring plan which ensures that the 
devices provide water that complies with the sulfate MCL. It is 
the responsibility of the public water system to operate and 
maintain the POU system. The microbiological safety of the water 
must be maintained at all times. The State shall require adequate 
certification of performance and a rigorous engineering design 
review. The design and application of the POU must consider the 
potential for increasing concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria 
in water treated with activated carbon.

<TEXT>
 

(D) The State must be assured that the POU and POE devices are properly installed, maintained and monitored. 

(vii) 

Period of delivery. 

The PWS shall provide Alternative Water for the following time periods: 

(A) Alternative Water shall be provided to each infant for the period requested, which may not exceed twenty weeks
from the date of initial delivery. Alternative Water delivery shall be provided for the full twenty weeks if requested,
even if the infant becomes one year of age during the delivery period. 

(B) Alternative Water shall be provided to each traveler and new 
resident for the period requested, not to exceed six weeks from 
the date of initial delivery. 

(3) 

Public Notification/Education Program. 

The requirements of this section apply only in States which have authorized the Alternative 
Method of Compliance. The requirements apply only to those PWSs in such 
States which have chosen to comply with the sulfate MCL through the 
Alternative Method of Compliance rather than by achieving the MCL in 
samples taken at each entry point to the distribution system. The PWS 
shall implement the public notification/education program described in this 
subsection in lieu of  141.32, and shall provide the State with copies of 
all public notification and education materials at the same time. There 
are four components to the program: Notices in bills, pamphlets, signs, 
and notices to the media. Transient systems (e.g., campgrounds and gas 
stations) and non-transient, non-community systems (e.g. schools, 
factories) shall be required to post signs in accordance with paragraphs 
(r)(3)(v) of this section, but shall not be required to comply with the 
requirements for notices in bills, notices to the media, or pamphlets in 
paragraphs (r)(3) (i)-(iv) and (vi) of this section. Community water 
systems which are non-transient systems shall comply with all four 
components set forth in paragraphs (r)(3) (i)-(vi) of this section, i.e., 
notices in bills, pamphlets, signs, and notices to the media. 

(i) 

Newspaper, mail, hand delivery, of notices. 

PWSs shall give notice by 
publication in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area served 
by the system as soon as possible, but in no case later than 14 days after 
sulfate in excess of the MCL has been detected in the water. The notice 
shall be repeated at intervals of 6 months while the sulfate concentration 
of the water in the distribution system continues to exceed the MCL. If 
the area served by a public water system is not served by a daily newspaper 
of general circulation, notice shall instead be given by publication in a 
weekly newspaper of general circulation. The notice shall define and 
describe the geographic location served by the system. In communities 
where a significant portion of the population speaks a language other than 
English, the text shall be published in the appropriate language(s), in 
addition to English. A telephone number(s) and an office location for 
requesting Alternative Water delivery shall be provided. The notice shall 
be provided at least once every six months by mail delivery (by direct mail 
or with the water bill), or by hand delivery, not later than 45 days after 
the sulfate MCL has been exceeded. 

(ii) 

Text of the Notice. 

The PWS shall, within 60 days of confirmed 
detection of sulfate in the distribution system, insert notices in each 
customer's water utility bill containing the following mandatory paragraph 
on the water bill itself in large bold print.




Warning: The water being supplied to you has high levels of sulfate which 
can cause diarrhea in people who are not used to it. If you have visitors 
in your home from outside the area, or if you are expecting a baby, please 
read the enclosed notice for further information.




The notices included in the water utility bill and those provided to the 
media shall also contain the following mandatory language. Any additional 
information presented shall be consistent with the information in these 
paragraphs, and in plain English that can be understood by laypersons. In 
communities where a significant portion of the population speaks a language 
other than English, the text shall be published in the appropriate 
language(s), in addition to English. The text shall be as follows: 
``Introduction. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 
the [insert name of State primacy agency], and [insert name of water 
supplier] are concerned about sulfate in your drinking water. Sulfate salts 
are found naturally in soil and rock in certain areas of the country, 
including ours. With the exception of infants, residents of the area 
should be accustomed to the sulfate in our drinking water, and should not 
experience ill effects. However, people who are not accustomed to high 
levels of sulfate in their drinking water may experience diarrhea. Under 
Federal law, we are required to provide sensitive populations with 
alternative water until their bodies adapt to the sulfate concentrations in 
our water. This brochure explains the simple steps you can take to protect 
the sensitive populations: infants, visitors from outside the area, and new 
residents. 



Health Effects of Sulfate



Ingestion of sulfate in high concentrations is 
known to cause diarrhea. The greatest risk is to infants, for whom 
prolonged diarrhea can be dangerous. New residents and travelers may also 
experience diarrhea when they first drink water with high levels of 
sulfate. After approximately two weeks, adult's bodies become accustomed 
to the sulfate, and the diarrhea stops. Available studies have not shown 
any long-term or chronic adverse effects from consuming sulfate in drinking 
water. Boiling the water will not reduce the sulfate content, and in fact, 
will concentrate it through evaporation of the water. 



The Alternative Water Program



If you are expecting a baby, if you are a new resident, or expecting visitors from outside the area, please call [insert
phone number of water system] to request delivery of alternative water to your home. We will provide you with sufficient
water for the cooking and drinking needs for each sensitive person. We will provide you with two liters per day of bottled
water for your infant for up to 20 weeks, during which time you should gradually add tap water to the bottled water. In
this way, your baby will become gradually accustomed to the sulfate in the water. We will provide your out-of-town
guests with two liters of bottled water per day for the period needed, up to a maximum of six weeks. We will provide new
residents with two liters per person per day for up to six weeks. During that time, tap water should be gradually mixed
with the bottled water. Restaurants and other establishments who are likely to serve at least some members of the target
population on a continual basis may be provided individual treatment devices, depending on our evaluation of the
size of the target population and other 
circumstances. 

(iii) 

New customers. 

The PWS shall provide notice of the 
following to new customers or billing units prior to or on the date service begins: Sulfate MCL exceedence in the water
entering the distribution system, the health effect of sulfate for target populations, and the need to mix bottled
water and tap water for gradual acclimation to sulfate.

(iv) 

Pamphlets. 

PWSs shall deliver pamphlets to all physicians and 
all medical facilities within the PWS service area, including, but not limited to, city, county and State health departments,
pharmacies, public and private hospitals and clinics, family planning clinics and local welfare agencies. The PWS
shall request the operators of such facilities to make the pamphlets available, in particular, to pregnant women.
The pamphlets shall contain the information in paragraph (r)(3)(ii) of this section. The pamphlet 
shall define the extent of the geographical service area in question. 

(v) 

Signs. 

A prominent, permanent sign in a durable material, such as plastic, shall be placed at each faucet, fountain or source
of water which could be used for drinking water in places such as restaurants, hotels/motels, rest areas, campgrounds,
gas stations and public areas where not all taps will have treated water. If such facilities are equipped with a POE
device or with POU devices such that all taps deliver water in compliance with the sulfate MCL, sign posting is not required.
The signs must state the location of the nearest source of water which complies with the sulfate MCL and why precautions
should be taken by non-acclimated persons. The text of the sign, in multiple languages where appropriate, shall be
as follows:




This water contains high levels of sulfates. This mineral can cause diarrhea in persons not accustomed to drinking
water with high sulfate content. Persistent diarrhea can cause dehydration. 
Special care should be taken for infants. Bottled water is 
available nearby at

XXXXXXXXXX

.

 


(vi) 

Notices to the media. 

PWSs shall submit copies of the notice 
described in paragraph (r)(3)(ii) of this section to radio and television stations that broadcast to the community
served by the water system as soon as possible, but in no case later than 14 days after sulfate in excess of the MCL has
been detected in the water, and once every six months while the water delivered into the distribution system exceeds
the sulfate MCL. The geographical service area in question shall be indicated and clearly defined in the notice. 

13. Section 141.33 is amended by adding paragraph (e) to read as follows: 



 141.33

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.


 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed revision to the nonprocurement common rule is issued in response to Executive Order 12689 and section
2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. E.O. 12689 requires agencies to establish regulations
for reciprocal governmentwide effect across procurement and nonprocurement for each agency's debarment and suspension
actions, after technical differences between the procurement and nonprocurement regulations governing debarments
and suspensions are resolved. Section 2455 provides that the debarment, suspension, or other exclusion of a participant
in a procurement activity under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or in a nonprocurement activity under regulations
issued pursuant to Executive Order 12549, shall be given reciprocal governmentwide effect.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As part of the Federal Government's initiatives to curb fraud, waste, and abuse, on February 18, 1986, President Reagan
signed Executive Order (E.O.) 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' E.O. 12549 established governmentwide effect
for an agency's nonprocurement debarment and suspension actions.


Section 6 of E.O. 12549 directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidelines governing implementation
of the Order, and section 3 of the Order directed the departments and agencies to promulgate final rules, consistent
with these guidelines. On May 26, 1988, 27 agencies issued a final common rule (53 FR 19161-19211), consistent
with OMB guidelines. On January 30, 1989, six more agencies co-signed the final common rule (54 FR 4722-4735).
On November 27, 1992 and May 17, 1993, two more agencies co-signed the final common rule (57 FR 56262 and 58 FR 28759).
On April 4, 1994, the functions of ACTION were transferred to the Corporation for National and Community Service.
Each agency's codification of the common rule appears in its volume of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, which participated in the initial rulemaking, no longer exists. On June 30, 1992, the Commission
on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution closed and thus will not participate in this proposed rulemaking.
Section 4 of E.O. 12549 established the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension (the Interagency Committee).
 On August 16, 1989, President Bush signed E.O. 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' E.O. 12689 requires agencies
to establish regulations providing for reciprocal governmentwide effect across procurement and nonprocurement
for each agency's debarment and suspension actions, after technical differences between the procurement and nonprocurement
regulations governing debarments and suspensions are resolved. 
 President Clinton signed Public Law 103-355, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 on October 13,
1994. Section 2455 of that Act provides that the debarment, suspension, or other exclusion of a participant in a procurement
activity under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or in a nonprocurement activity under regulations issued pursuant
to E.O. 12549, shall be given reciprocal governmentwide effect. Thus, these proposed regulations would implement
both E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Pub. L. 103-355.
 The Interagency Committee established three subcommittees that identified issues and made recommendations for
consideration by the full Interagency Committee. The matters addressed by the three subcommittees were technical
differences between the procurement and nonprocurement rules, automation issues, and nonprocurement scope. In
1989, the Interagency Committee presented recommendations to the agencies participating in this rulemaking action.
The agencies considered these proposed changes and concluded that the initial recommendations addressed more issues
than necessary to implement the Executive Order. As a result, representatives of the participating agencies reconsidered
their initial recommendations and determined that very few technical differences needed to be resolved to obtain
reciprocity between the procurement and nonprocurement rules. The determinations of the agency representatives
are incorporated in this notice of proposed rulemaking.
 Section 3 of E.O. 12689 directed the agencies to simultaneously publish proposed rules within six months after resolution
of differences between the procurement and nonprocurement rules and to publish final regulations within 12 months
after publication of the proposed rules. The Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions governing debarments and
suspensions are also being published for comment today.

In order to focus commenters' attention on the changes that are proposed for the nonprocurement debarment and suspension
rule, the agencies participating in this proposed rulemaking_all but the Department of Transportation which did
not complete clearance of this proposed rule_have decided to publish the text of only those portions of the common
rule that are affected by changes proposed by the Interagency Committee, rather than publishing the complete text
of the common rule. Comments are sought on only those portions of the common rule that are proposed for amendment in
this document.
In addition to the amendments discussed below, the agencies propose to make minor technical changes to correct spelling
errors and other nonsubstantive errors in the printing of the common rule.


Section-by-Section Analysis
Subpart A.


Section 

XXXX

.100, Purpose.
The agencies participating in this rulemaking action propose to amend 


XXXX

.100, 

Purpose, 

to reflect the E.O. 12689 requirement that both procurement and nonprocurement debarment and suspension actions
have governmentwide effect across procurement and nonprocurement programs and activities.
Section 

XXXX

.105, Definitions.
 Under  

XXXX

.105 as proposed for amendment, the definition of the nonprocurement list would be replaced by a new definition for
a ``List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.'' The List will integrate all
procurement and nonprocurement debarments, suspensions, and other exclusionary actions. 
The definitions section also contains proposed technical amendments to implement E.O. 12689 and to correct printing
errors in the initial publication of the common rule.
Section 

XXXX

.110, Coverage.
Section 

XXXX

.110(c) would be amended to provide for reciprocity between nonprocurement and procurement debarment and suspension
actions. Under the reciprocity rule, every Executive Branch agency would have to give effect not only to exclusionary
actions of other Federal agencies under the common rule but also to debarments, suspensions, proposed debarments
or other governmentwide exclusions imposed under the Federal Acquisition Regulation after the effective date of
the common rule reciprocity amendments. Thus, for example, once an agency has proposed for debarment an entity under
the FAR, no other executive agency could enter into a covered transaction with that entity nor could a primary tier
recipient enter into a lower tier covered transaction with that entity.
Section 

XXXX

.225, Failure to adhere to restrictions.
Section 

XXXX

.225 would be amended to make clear that the prohibition against knowingly doing business under a covered transaction
with a person who is debarred or suspended also prohibits doing business with a person proposed for debarment under
the FAR.



Appendix A. 


The agencies propose to amend paragraph (1)(a) of the 

Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters_Primary Covered Transactions


to ensure that it covers actions taken under the Federal Acquisition Regulation to debar, suspend, propose for debarment,
or otherwise take a governmentwide exclusionary action.



Impact analyses


Executive Order 12866


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. These proposed amendments would unify two separate debarment
and suspension systems_nonprocurement and procurement_that previously existed. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980


The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) requires that, for each rule with a ``significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' an analysis must be prepared describing the rule's impact on small
entities, identifying any significant alternatives to the rule that would minimize the economic impact on the small
entities.
The participating agencies certify that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.


Paperwork Reduction Act


The participating agencies certify that this proposed rule would not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

(i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil judgment, or 

(ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal
Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced.

Suspending official's decision. 



The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (see  24.320(c)) for reasons for reducing the

be without prejudice to the subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by any agency. The
decision shall be rendered in accordance with the following provisions: 

(a) No additional proceedings necessary. 

In actions based upon an indictment, conviction, or civil judgment, in which there is no genuine dispute over material
facts, or in which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of Department
of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative
record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 days after receipt of
any information and argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official extends this period for
good cause. 

(b) 

Additional proceedings necessary. 



(1) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, written findings
of fact shall be prepared. The suspending official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any
information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other information in the administrative record. 



(2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed material facts to another official for findings
of fact. The suspending official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining
them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly erroneous. 

(3) If the suspending official refers disputed material facts to an Administrative Law Judge or Member of the Board
of Contract Appeals, the provisions of part 26 of this chapter shall be generally applicable to the proceeding, with
the exception that no appeal to the Secretary may be taken under   26.24-26.26 of this chapter with

 24.712 

Conference. 


Within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation, the respondent may request a conference
with the official who issued such notice. If the respondent does not request a conference within such 30-day period,
the notice of limited denial of participation shall become final. The conference shall precede any submission in
opposition under  24.713 of this part. It shall be held within 15 days after the Department's receipt of the request
for a conference, unless the respondent waives this time limit. The official who imposed the sanction, or his or her
designee, shall preside. At the conference, the respondent may appear with a representative and may present all relevant
information and materials to the official or designee. Within 20 days after the conference, the official shall, in
writing, advise the respondent of the decision to terminate, modify, or affirm the limited denial of participation.
If the official's decision is to affirm all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion, the notice of affirmation

and argument in opposition to the notice of affirmation. The information and argument should be addressed to the Debarment
Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410. If
the respondent does not contest the notice of affirmation within the 30-day period, the notice shall become final.

(b) 

Procedures. 

The procedures of 24.313 and 24.314 shall govern respondent's contest of the notice of affirmation. 
(c) 

Effect of suspension or debarment on limited denial of participation. 

If a respondent has contested a notice of affirmation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and if the respondent
has also received, pursuant to subpart C or D of this part, a notice of proposed debarment or suspension that is based
on the same transaction(s) or conduct as the limited denial of participation, the following rules shall apply: 
(1) If the respondent has not contested the proposed debarment pursuant to  24.313(a) or the suspension pursuant
to  24.412(a), the final imposition of the debarment or suspension shall also constitute a final decision with
respect to the limited denial of participation to the extent that the debarment or suspension is based on the same transaction(s)
or conduct as the limited denial of participation. 
(2) If the respondent has contested the proposed debarment pursuant to  24.313(a) of this part or the suspension
pursuant to  24.412(a), the hearing official shall consolidate the hearings on the limited denial of participation
and on the proposed debarment or suspension. 
(3) To the extent that the limited denial of participation is based on additional transaction(s) or conduct that are
not described in the notice of proposed debarment or suspension, the hearing official shall, in his or her discretion,
either withdraw the limited denial of participation to the extent of such additional bases, or issue a decision on
them. 

22. A new section 24.714 would be added to read as follows: 



 24.714 

Reporting of limited denial of participation. 


If the period for requesting a conference pursuant to  24.712 of this part has expired without receipt of such
a request, or if a conference has been held and a notice of affirmation of all or part of the remaining period of exclusion
has been issued pursuant to  24.712, the official imposing the limited denial of participation shall notify
the Director of the Participation and Compliance Division in the Office of Housing of the scope of the limited denial
of participation.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Debarment, 
Suspension, and Ineligibility (Ethics)



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule is issued pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Public Law 103-355
(the Act). The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council is considering amending Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Subpart 9.4, Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility, the clause at 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's
Interest when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended or Proposed for Debarment, and provisions in
parts 22, 28, and 44, respectively. This includes information required to support the policy of ensuring that suspensions,
debarments, and other exclusions from procurement and nonprocurement activities receive reciprocal Government-wide
effect as directed by Executive Order (E.O.) 12689, dated August 16, 1989, and Section 2455, Uniform Suspension and
Debarment, of the Act. This regulatory action was subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive
Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



A. Background



The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-355 (the Act), provides authorities that streamline
the acquisition process and minimize burdensome government-unique requirements. Major changes that can be expected
in the acquisition process as a result of the Act's implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial Item
Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and introduction of the Federal
Acquisition Computer Network. In order to promptly achieve the benefits of the provisions of the Act, the Government
is issuing implementing regulations on an expedited basis. We believe prompt publication of proposed rules provides
the public the opportunity to participate more fully in the process of developing regulations.

FAR case 94-801 originated because Section 2455 of Public Law 103-355 was enacted to remedy the current
situation where suspensions, debarments and other exclusions from procurement and nonprocurement activities
do not have reciprocal Government-wide effect. The concept of reciprocity for procurement and nonprocurement suspension
and debarment actions is not new. Since August 1989 there has been an effort to do by executive order (

i.e.

, E.O. 12689), what section 2455 now prescribes by law. That earlier effort was worked on by a committee known as the
``Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension.'' This Interagency Committee is made up of 16 Federal executive
agencies that impose nonprocurement suspensions and debarments. By October 1994 the agencies in an ad hoc group reached
agreement on the language that would implement the concept of reciprocity and be consistent with the principles of
the National Performance Review. The language proposed for FAR 9.401, Applicability, has been coordinated with
the ad hoc group of agencies. The proposed changes to the procurement and nonprocurement rules will implement Section
2455 and E.O. 12689 by ensuring that suspensions, debarments, and other exclusions from procurement and nonprocurement
activities have reciprocal Government-wide effect.

The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of
the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not
scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94-801) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature
of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting
and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see 

ADDRESSES 

caption) on or before January 19, 1995.

The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 Only a very small percentage of Federal contractors are debarred or suspended. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties.
Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with Section
610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite FAR case 94-801 in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

Amendments To Clarify Safe Harbors for Broker-Dealer Research Reports 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is proposing today amendments relating to the safe harbor provisions of Rules 138 and 139 under the
Securities Act of 1933. The proposed amendments are intended to clarify the availability of the safe harbor provisions
of Rule 138 relating to broker-dealer research reports on individual companies and the availability of the safe harbor
provisions of Rule 139 for broker-dealer industry research reports which include sizable, first-time foreign registrants.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 As described in detail below, the Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 138
 and Rule 139
 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act'').








I. Availability of Research Report Safe Harbors 



A. Rule 139 Safe Harbor 



Rule 139 under the Securities Act provides safe harbor protection from the registration requirements of that Act
for the distribution by broker-dealers of information, opinions or recommendations concerning issuers in the process
of registering securities under the Securities Act. 

Prior to April 1994, reliance on the safe harbor for research reports concerning a foreign private issuer were conditioned
on eligibility of the foreign private issuer for use of Form F-3.

4

 On April 19, 1994, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 139 that make the rule available for offerings by foreign
private issuers that would be eligible to use Form F-3 but for the 12-month reporting requirement if the issuer
meets an alternative offshore trading history test.

5

 Under the alternative test, a foreign private issuer must have been listed or quoted on a designated offshore securities
market

6

 for a period of at least 12 months. 







In adopting these amendments, the Commission intended that broker-dealers would be able to rely upon Rule 139 for
sizable foreign private issuers with respect to which there is a stream of corporate information available in the
marketplace, including qualifying foreign issuers registering securities with the Commission for the first time.
As drafted, however, the amendments did not make clear that the elimination of the reporting history requirement
included the elimination of the requirement that a foreign issuer be previously reporting pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'')

7

 and have filed at least one annual report. 





The amendments proposed today revise Rule 139 to make clear that the special provisions adopted last year for sizable
foreign issuers are also available for those issuers' initial public offerings in the United States.

B. Rule 138 Safe Harbor 



Rule 138 under the Securities Act permits publication of information, opinions and recommendations concerning
qualifying issuers by broker-dealers that are participants in a distribution, so long as the reports contain information,
opinions or recommendations regarding a specified class of the issuer's securities which is not the subject of the
offering in which the broker-dealer is a participant. The rule defines eligible issuers as those that may register
securities on Forms S-2

9

 or F-2.

10

 The reference to Forms S-2 and F-2 is intended to include issuers eligible to register on Forms S-3
and F-3 as well. Questions have arisen as to the availability of the Rule 138 safe harbor for offerings registered
on Form S-3 where issuers have not been subject to reporting requirements for 36 months. The Commission did not
intend to change the availability of Rule 138 for those offerings when it reduced the reporting history requirements
for Form S-3

11

 and is of the view that Rule 138 is still available for offerings registered on Form S-3. Rule 138 is proposed to
be amended to clarify this point. The Commission is also proposing to amend the rule to clarify that Form F-3 eligible
issuers would qualify for the rule, as would qualifying first-time foreign issuers that meet the alternative offshore
trading history test proposed for Rule 139.

12

 








In addition, in light of the fact that shelf registration statements often register both debt and equity securities
(on an either allocated or unallocated basis), the Commission is proposing to add an instruction to Rule 138 to codify
the staff interpretation that the rule should be applied on an offering-by-offering basis for issuers which are eligible
to use Forms S-3 or F-3 and are using the Commission's shelf registration procedures. 



II. Cost-Benefit Analysis




To fully evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the proposed amendments to Rule 138 and Rule 139, the Commission
requests commenters to provide views and empirical data as to the costs and benefits associated with such proposals.




III. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Chairman of the Commission has certified that the
proposed amendments to Securities Act Rules 138 and 139 relating to broker-dealer research reports (17 CFR 230.138
and 17 CFR 230.139) will not, if adopted, have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
certification, including the reasons therefor, is attached as Appendix A to this release. 



IV. General Request for Comments 



Any interested person wishing to submit written comments on any aspect of the amendments to the rules that are subject
to this release are requested to do so. Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary,
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549 and should refer to file number
S7-36-94. 



V. Statutory Bases 




The amendments to the Commission's rule are being proposed pursuant to sections 6, 7, 8, 10 and 19(a) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended.

2. By revising  230.138 to read as follows: 



 230.138 


Definition of ``offer for sale'' and ``offer to sell'' in sections 2(10) and 5(c) in relation to certain publications.



(a) Where a registrant which meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section proposes
to file, has filed or has an effective registration statement under the Act relating solely to a nonconvertible debt
security or to a nonconvertible, nonparticipating preferred stock, publication or distribution in the regular
course of its business by a broker or dealer of information, opinions or recommendations relating solely to common
stock or to debt or preferred stock convertible into common stock of such registrant shall not be deemed to constitute
an offer for sale or offer to sell the security to which such registration statement relates for purposes of sections
2(10) and 5(c) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77a 

et seq.

) even though such broker or dealer is or will be a participant in the distribution of the security to which such registration
statement relates. 

(b) Where a registrant which meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section proposes
to file, has filed or has an effective registration statement under the Act relating solely to common stock or to debt
or preferred stock convertible into common stock, the publication or distribution in the regular course of its business
by a broker or dealer of information, opinions or recommendations relating solely to a nonconvertible debt security,
or to a nonconvertible nonparticipating preferred stock shall not be deemed to constitute an offer for sale or offer
to sell the security to which such registration statement relates for purposes of sections 2(10) and 5(c) of the Act
(15 U.S.C. 77a 

et seq.

), even though such broker or dealer is or will be a participant in the distribution of the security to which such registration
statement relates. 

(c)(1) The registrant meets all of the conditions for the use of Form S-2 ( 239.12 of this chapter) or Form
F-2 ( 239.32 of this chapter); 

(2) The registrant meets the registrant requirements of Form S-3 ( 239.13 of this chapter) or Form F-3
( 239.33 of this chapter); or 

(3) The registrant is a foreign private issuer which meets all the registrant requirements of Form F-3 ( 239.33
of this chapter), other than the reporting history provisions of paragraph A.1. and A.2.(a) of General Instruction
I of such form, and meets the minimum float or investment grade securities provisions of either paragraph B.1. or B.2.
of General Instruction I. of such form and the registrant's securities have been traded for a period of at least 12 months
on a designated offshore securities market, as defined in  230.902(a). 



Instruction to Rule 138 



When a registration statement relates to securities which are being registered for an offering to be made on a continuous
or delayed basis pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(x) under the Act 
( 230.415(a)(1)(x)) and the securities which are being registered include classes of securities which are
specified in both paragraph (a) and (b) of this section on either an allocated or unallocated basis, a broker or dealer
may nonetheless rely on: 

(1) Paragraph (a) of this section when the offering in which such broker or dealer is or will be a participant relates
solely to classes of securities specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and 

(2) Paragraph (b) of this section when the offering in which such broker or dealer is or will be a participant relates
solely to classes of securities specified in paragraph (b) of this section. 

3. By revising the introductory text to  230.139 and paragraph (a)(2) to read as follows: 



 230.139 


Definition of ``offer for sale'' and ``offer to sell'' in sections 2(10) and 5(c) in relation to certain publications.



Where a registrant which is required to file reports pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 

et seq.

) or which is a foreign private issuer meeting the conditions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section proposes to file,
has filed or has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a 

et seq.

) relating to its securities, the publication or distribution by a broker or dealer of information, an opinion or a
recommendation with respect to the registrant or any class of its securities shall not be deemed to constitute an offer
for sale or offer to sell the securities registered or proposed to be registered for purposes of sections 2(10) and
5(c) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77a 

et seq.

), even though such broker or dealer is or will be a participant in the distribution of such securities, if the conditions
of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section have been met: 

(a)(1) * * *

(2) The registrant is a foreign private issuer that meets all the registrant requirements of Form F-3 ( 239.33
of this chapter), other than the reporting history provisions of paragraphs A.1. and A.2.(a) of General Instruction
I of such form, and meets the minimum float or investment grade securities provisions of either paragraph B.1. or B.2.
of General Instruction I of such form, and the registrant's securities have been traded for a period of at least 12 months
on a designated offshore securities market, as defined in  230.902(a), and such information, opinion or recommendation
is contained in a publication which is distributed with reasonable regularity in the normal course of business.

Securities and Exchange Commission Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



I, Arthur Levitt, Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission''), hereby
certify pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that proposed revisions to Rules 138 and 139 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
``Securities Act''), if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The reason for this certification is that the proposed revisions to the rules are intended to clarify the
availability of the safe harbor provisions of the rules with respect to large domestic and foreign issuers. Any incidental
impact on small U.S. entities is not expected to be significant.

Mortgagee Review Board; Proceedings Before a Hearing Officer 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, HUD. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would make changes in the Department's regulations governing sanctions imposed by the Mortgagee
Review Board. The proposed rule would also make conforming changes to the regulations concerning HUD's hearing officers,
consistent with the revisions proposed herein and in the proposed revision to 24 CFR part 24 published elsewhere in
today's 

Federal Register

. The changes to the Mortgagee Review Board actions are intended to follow more closely the statutory provisions set
forth at 12 U.S.C. 1708(c). The Department considers these proposed revisions necessary to comply with the President's
directive to streamline agency operations throughout the Executive Branch. The proposed revisions are also an element
in the Government reinvention process at the Department. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 202 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1708 (c) and (d)) established the Mortgagee Review Board (``Board'').
Section 202(c)(4) directs the Board to ``hold a hearing on the record'' concerning sanctions it has taken against
a mortgagee, if the mortgagee so requests within 30 days notice of the Board's action. However, HUD's current regulations
delegate the Board's authority to hold hearings to hearing officers (administrative law judges and Board of Contract
Appeals judges). These proceedings have proven extremely time-consuming and expensive. Accordingly, this proposed
rule will return the hearing function to the Board, thereby streamlining the hearing process.

The proposed rule also implements the 1992 amendments to Section 202. These amendments limited a suspension issued
by the Board to not more than one year, unless extended for not more than six additional months, to protect the public
interest, or unless extended with the mortgagee's agreement. The amendments also clarified that the term ``mortgagee''
included lenders or loan correspondents approved under the National Housing Act. 

The proposed rule also would make conforming changes to HUD's regulations governing hearing officers, consistent
with the proposed revisions both to the Board's regulations and to 24 CFR part 24, published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

. 

Written comments from the public will be considered prior to issuance of a final rule. No hearing will be conducted
with respect to this proposed rule. 



Findings and Other Matters 



Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment required by the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331) is unnecessary since the rule addresses administrative decisions whose content does
not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of a project area or building. 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Secretary by his approval of this rule certifies that
this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule would implement
statutory authority that is intended to prote
