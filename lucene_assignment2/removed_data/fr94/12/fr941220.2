</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

GIPSA announces the designation of Minnesota Department of Agriculture to provide official inspection and Class
X and Class Y weighing services under the United States Grain Standards Act, as amended (Act). 






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action has been reviewed and determined not to be a rule or regulation as defined
in Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1; therefore, the Executive Order and Departmental
Regulation do not apply to this action.



In the July 1, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 33950), GIPSA announced that the designation of Minnesota would expire on December 31, 1994, and asked persons
interested in providing official services in the geographic area assigned to Minnesota to submit an application
for designation. Applications were due by August 1, 1994. There were five applicants for the Minnesota area: Minnesota
applied for the entire area currently assigned to them; Southern Minnesota Grain Inspection, Inc., applied for all
or part of the Minnesota area; Mid-Iowa Grain Inspection, Inc., applied for the Minnesota counties of Fillmore, Houston,
Olmsted, Winona, Wabasha, Goodhue, and Dakota, or any area inclusive of the city of Winona; D. R. Schaal Agency applied
for all or any part of the Minnesota counties of Faribault, Freeborn, and Mower; and Sioux City Inspection and Weighing
Service Company applied for the Minnesota counties of Murray, Nobles, Pipestone, and Rock.

GIPSA requested comments on the applicants in the September 1, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 45295). Comments were due by September 30, 1994. GIPSA received 51 comments by the deadline. One comment was
about two of the applicants. There were no comments on Mid-Iowa. There were 14 comments on Minnesota. Two grain firms
currently served by Minnesota and one official grain inspection agency supported Minnesota. There also were 11 comments
from various State government officials and groups representing State employees, all supporting Minnesota's redesignation.
There were 3 comments on Schaal. Three grain firms, in the area Schaal applied for and currently served by Minnesota,
submitted comments supporting Schaal. There were no comments on Sioux City. There were 29 comments on Southern Minnesota.
Twenty-three grain firms in the area currently served by Minnesota and 6 non-grain businesses supported Southern
Minnesota. Four trade organizations and 2 grain firms also submitted comments with no specific recommendations.
These groups urge FGIS to carefully consider all options, with a special view towards the quality and cost of service,
and ability to provide service in the State of Minnesota.

GIPSA evaluated all available information regarding the designation criteria in Section 7(f)(1)(A) of the Act;
and according to Section 7(f)(1)(B), determined that Minnesota is better able to provide official services in the
geographic area for which they applied.

Effective January 1, 1995, and ending December 31, 1997, Minnesota is designated to provide official inspection
and Class X and Class Y weighing services in the geographic area specified in the July 1, 1994, 

Federal Register

The Governments of the United States and Pakistan agreed to amend further their Bilateral Cotton, Man-Made Fiber,
Silk Blend and Other Vegetable Fiber Textile Agreement, effected by exchange of notes dated May 20, 1987 and June 11,
1987, as amended and extended. The two governments agreed, among other things, to establish new specific limits for

Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directives issued to you on February 1, 1994, May
13, 1994, July 13, 1994, September 14, 1994 and September 16, 1994, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation
of Textile Agreements. Those directives concern imports of certain cotton and man-made fiber textile products,
produced or manufactured in Pakistan and exported during the periods April 29, 1994 through July 27, 1994 and July
28, 1994 through December 31, 1994, in the case of Categories 342/642; June 29, 1994 through September 26, 1994 and
September 27, 1994 through December 31, 1994, in the case of Category 628; and January 1, 1994 through December 31,
1994, in the case of the remaining categories.

Effective on December 20, 1994, you are directed, pursuant to the Bilateral Cotton, Man-Made Fiber, Silk Blend and
Other Vegetable Fiber Textile Agreement, effected by exchange of notes dated May 20, 1987 and June 11, 1987, as amended
and extended, between the Governments of the United States and Pakistan to combine the April 29, 1994 through July
27, 1994 and July 28, 1994 through December 31, 1994 restraint periods for Categories 342/642. The limit for Categories
342/642 shall be increased to a level of 172,562 dozen

.





Import charges made to the 1994 Aggregate Designated Consultation Level (DCL) for Category 342 for the period January
1, 1994 through April 28, 1994 shall remain in the Aggregate DCL. For the import period April 29, 1994 through May 19,
1994, you are directed to deduct 568 dozen from the charges made to the Aggregate DCL for Category 342 and charge this
same amount to Category 342 for the April 29, 1994 through December 31, 1994 restraint period. For the import period
July 28, 1994 through September 21, 1994, you are directed to charge 151 dozen to Category 642 for the April 29, 1994
through December 31, 1994 restraint period.


Further, you are directed to remove Category 317, along with its charges, from the Aggregate DCL coverage. The June
29, 1994 through September 26, 1994 and September 27, 1994 through December 31, 1994 restraint periods for Category
628 shall be combined. You are directed to establish merged Categories 317/617 and 369-F/369-P, for the
restraint period January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994; and Categories 625/626/627/628/629, for the restraint
period June 29, 1994 through December 31, 1994, at the levels listed below. Import charges already made to Categories
317, 617, 369-F, 369-P and 628 shall be retained and applied to the newly established merged categories.






You are directed to charge the following amounts to the categories listed below for goods imported during the periods
June 29, 1994 through September 30, 1994 (Categories 625, 626, 627 and 629) and June 29 through July 19, 1994 (Category
628):






Textile products in Categories 625, 626, 627 and 629 which have been exported to the United States prior to June 29,
1994 shall not be subject to this directive.

Textile products in Categories 625, 626, 627 and 629 which have been released from the custody of the U.S. Customs Service
under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1448(b) or 1484(a)(1) prior to the effective date of this directive shall not be denied
entry under this directive.


Also, you are directed to adjust the limits for the following categories, pursuant to the current bilateral agreement
between the Governments of the United States and Pakistan:







For visa purposes, you are directed, effective on December 20, 1994, to amend further the directive dated May 27, 1983.
Categories 642 and 842 shall no longer be accepted as merged Categories 642/842. You are directed to include coverage
of merged Categories 342/642, 317/617, 369-F/369-P and 625/626/627/628/629 for goods produced or manufactured
in Pakistan and exported from Pakistan on and after December 20, 1994. Merchandise in merged Categories 342/642,
317/617, 369-F/369-P and 625/626/627/628/629 may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category
visa or the correct category or part-category visa corresponding to the actual shipment. 
Shipments entered or withdrawn from warehouse according to this directive which are not accompanied by an appropriate
export visa shall be denied entry and a new visa must be obtained.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign
affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

 Notice of changes to a system of records. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 29, 1994, the Department of Education published a notice of a new system of records for the National Student
Loan Data System (NSLDS). The Department solicited comments on the routine uses for the system and submitted a report
of the system to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress. The Department received comments from one
commenter and some suggestions from OMB regarding improvements to the notice. Several changes have been made to the
system as a result of this input and are discussed in the supplementary information portion of this notice. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33491) a notice of a new system of records for the National Student Loan Data System (18-40-0039).
The Department received comments from one commenter and some suggestions for improvement to the system notice from
OMB. As a result, several changes have been made to the system notice. Those changes are discussed below. 




Regarding the categories of individuals clause, it was noted that the phrase ``borrowers who have applied for loans
under the FFEL (Federal Family Education Loan) Program will be tracked on this new system . . .''
implies that the system will maintain data on all students who have applied for aid under Title IV of the Higher Education
Act of 1965 (Title IV, HEA) not just those who have received aid. The Department did not intend to cover under this system
applicants who may apply for but do not receive aid and this clause has been modified to refer to individuals who applied
for and received certain Title IV loans. In addition, because the system notice only covers individuals, references
to persons who have died are removed, because persons who have died are not considered individuals under the Privacy
Act. However, as a practical matter, the Department will maintain information about these persons as necessary to
manage the Title IV program. 


Regarding the categories of records clause, the entry ``an applicant's demographic background'' has been removed
because it was only descriptive of the categories of information that followed. 


Regarding the routine uses for the system, the following paragraphs discuss the changes the Department is making
to the system and issues raised by the comments. 

Routine use (a): Program purposes. Paragraph (2) has been removed and the entities for which each disclosure is appropriate
have been included with the program purpose disclosures. A number of program purpose routine uses were dropped from
the notice because the Department does not disclose individually identifiable information in connection with certain
purposes that were included in the original Privacy Act notice. The program purposes have been broken out into a series
of eight (8) separate routine uses. Also, the program purpose routine uses are recast to focus on the purpose of each
disclosure rather than the end results of the disclosure. Disclosure to OMB under the Credit Reform Act (CRA) is removed
from the program purpose routine uses and stated as a separate routine use. The General Accounting Office (GAO) is
removed as a recipient under the program purpose routine uses because it can get records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(10)
in the course of performing its duties. Finally, consistent with the preamble of the initial notice of this system
and as stated in the purposes of the system, disclosures from this system of records may be made to enforce the terms
of a loan and to collect a loan. This purpose for disclosure is clarified now in routine use (a). 


Routine use (b)(2): Litigation Disclosure. OMB suggested that the Department clarify the routine use permitting
disclosure to counsel to clearly indicate that this routine use authorized disclosure only to opposing counsel.
OMB also asked that the Department clarify the distinctions among the various types of disclosures made under routine
use (b)(2). Routine use (b) has been restructured to address these concerns. OMB commented that a routine use was not
appropriate for disclosures to a court, as specified in (b)(2) of the notice, because these disclosures should be
made under a court order, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11). Therefore, disclosure to courts has been removed from
this routine use. 


One of the commenters was concerned that disclosure to opposing counsel and other parties in administrative proceedings
under (b)(2) would be inappropriate because these disclosures should be obtained under a court order. The Assistant
Secretary disagrees because he believes that such a requirement would create an unnecessary burden on the public
and the Department. For example, if the Department is involved in administrative litigation with a school regarding
the school's default rate calculation, the school would have access to information pursuant to the program purpose
routine use. However, the school may need to disclose to its outside counsel certain individually identifiable information
obtained from the Department. Disclosure to the school's counsel in this case, in the interest of ensuring proper
adjudication of default rate challenges, would certainly be consistent with the purposes for which the records in
this system are maintained. However, if the school had to obtain a court order from the district court before it could
make such a disclosure, the administrative litigation would be unnecessarily burdened. Thus, the Assistant Secretary
has decided to keep in this routine use disclosures to opposing counsels and other representatives of parties in administrative
litigation with the Department.

Routine use (d): Contract Disclosure. This routine use has been rewritten to clarify its meaning. 

Routine use (e): Employee Grievance, Complaint or Conduct Disclosure. This routine use has been revised to make it
clearer. 

Routine use (f): Labor Organization Disclosure. It was suggested that the Department remove this routine use as unnecessary.
However, the Assistant Secretary foresees the possibility of a case in which a supervisor takes an action against
an employee and cites specific alleged mishandling of Privacy Act information by the employee as the basis for the
action. The employee is entitled to representation by a union representative who might need access to the individually
identifiable information in order to adequately protect the interests of the employee. This routine use is consistent
with the purposes of the system in that it ensures that questions about proper handling of confidential information
are properly addressed to the benefit of the individuals on whom the Department maintains information in this system
of records. 


Routine use (g): Research Disclosure. This routine use has been removed because 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(5) adequately covers
the needs intended to be served by this routine use. 


Routine use (i): FOIA Advice Disclosure. The Office of Management and Budget suggested that disclosure to OMB of individually
identifiable information be removed because the Department can obtain sufficient advice on Privacy Act matters
from OMB without disclosing individually identifiable information. The reference to OMB disclosures has been removed.


Routine use (j): Subpoena Disclosure. This routine use is removed because it appears inconsistent with certain judicial
decisions relating to the Privacy Act. 


Regarding the Safeguards clause for the system, the description of the safeguards has been rewritten to indicate
more precisely the nature of the safeguards used to protect this system. 


Regarding the Retention and Disposal clause for the system, the details regarding optical disk storage as a means
of archiving data has been changed to clarify that the shelf life of the archived information will be enhanced through
an optical disk maintenance program and will be maintained for a total of ten years after the loan is closed. 


The commenter was concerned about the timeframe for implementation of the NSLDS system and the enhancements to its
own system so that it can report information to the NSLDS. The commenter was also concerned that the Department appeared
to be making changes to data elements in the system and believed that the Department should continue to involve program
participants in the implementation strategies for NSLDS, including setting the appropriate implementation timeframes.
Contrary to the commenter's understanding, the data elements that will require system enhancements are not required
to be reported until July 1995, and the Department is now making changes to data elements that will be submitted to NSLDS.
The Department has worked closely with program participants during the design phase of this system and intends to
continue working closely with them. 

The system notice is being republished in its entirety to assist readers in understanding the context for the changes
that are being made.

(v) The United States where ED determines that the litigation is likely to affect the Department or any of its components.


(2) Disclosure to the Department of Justice. If ED determines that disclosure of certain records to the Department
of Justice or attorneys engaged by the Department of Justice is relevant and necessary to litigation and is compatible
with the purpose for which the records were collected, ED may disclose those records as a routine use to the Department
of Justice. 

(3) Administrative Disclosures. If ED determines that disclosure of certain records to an adjudicative body before
which ED is authorized to appear, individual or entity designated by ED or otherwise empowered to resolve disputes
is relevant and necessary to the administrative litigation and is compatible with the purpose for which the records
were collected, ED may disclose those records as a routine use to the adjudicative body, individual or entity. 

(4) Opposing counsels, representatives and witnesses. If ED determines that disclosure of certain records to an
opposing counsel, representative or witness in an administrative proceeding is relevant and necessary to the litigation
and is compatible with the purpose for which the records were collected, ED may disclose those records as a routine
use to the counsel, representative or witness. 

(c) Enforcement disclosure.

 In the event that information in this system of records indicates, either on its face or in connection with other information,

in this system of records may be disclosed as a routine use to such an organization.

(h) 

Computer matching disclosure.

 Any information from this system of records, including personal information obtained from other agencies through
computer matching programs, may be disclosed to a Federal or State agency under a computer matching agreement in connection
with an individual's application for, or participation in, any grant or loan program administered by ED. The purposes
of these disclosures may be to determine program eligibility and benefits, enforce the condition and terms of a loan
or grant, permit the servicing and collecting of the loan or grant, prosecute or enforce debarment, suspension, and
exclusionary actions, counsel the individual in repayment efforts, investigate possible fraud and verify compliance
with program regulations, locate a delinquent or defaulted debtor, and initiate legal action against an individual
involved in program fraud or abuse.

Congressional member disclosure.

 ED may disclose information from this system of records to a congressional office from the record of an individual
in response to an inquiry from the congressional office made at the written request of that individual; the Member's
right to the information is no greater than the right of the individual who requested it.



Disclosure to consumer reporting agencies:





Disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12):

 The Department may disclose to a consumer reporting agency information regarding a claim which is determined to be
valid and overdue as follows: (1) The name, taxpayer identification number and other information necessary to establish
the identity of the individual responsible for the claim; (2) the amount, status, and history of the claim; and (3)
the program under which the claim arose. The Department may disclose the information specified in this paragraph
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12) and the procedures contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711 (f). A consumer reporting agency to which
these disclosures may be made is defined at 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f), and 31 U.S.C. 3701 (a)(3).



Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disclosing of records in the system:

Storage:



The records are maintained on magnetic tape and computer disk media.



Retrievability:



Data are retrieved by matching social security number, name and date of birth.



Safeguards:



All physical access to the sites of the contractor where this system of records is maintained, is controlled and monitored
by security personnel who check each individual entering the building for his or her employee or visitor badge. The
computer system employed by the Department of Education offers a high degree of resistance to tampering and circumvention
by use of software that requires user access to be defined down to the individual data element. This security system
limits data access to Department of Education and contract staff on a ``need to know'' basis, including external users
of the system (guaranty agency and school personnel) and controls individual users' ability to access and alter records
within the system. All users of this system are given a unique user ID with a personal identifier. The software monitors
and tracks changes to any data element. Any change to the database is recorded, together with the identity of the individual
user who made the change.

<TEXT>
 

Retention and disposal:



Records of individual loans will be archived twelve months after a loan is closed. The loan will be archived to optical
disk for economical and efficient storage. An Optical Disk Maintenance Program will be implemented to lengthen the
shelf-life of the exposure on the optical disk. The Department will retain and dispose of NSLDS records in accordance
with the ED Comprehensive Records Disposition Schedule, Part 10 item 16(a)(b)(c)(d)(e), which permits retention
for a maximum period of ten years after the loan is closed.



System manager(s) and address:



Director, Division of Program Systems Service, U. S. Department of Education, Office of Postsecondary Education,
600 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20202-5175.



Notification procedure:



If an individual wishes to determine whether a record exists regarding him or her in this system of records, the individual
must provide the system manager his or her name, date of birth, social security number, and the name of the school or
lender from which the loan or grant was obtained. Requests for notification about an individual must meet the requirements
of the Department of Education's Privacy Act regulations at 34 CFR 5b.5.



Record access procedures:



If an individual wishes to gain access to a record in this system, he or she must contact the system manager and provide
information as described in the notification procedures.



Contesting record procedures:



If an individual wishes to change the content of a record in the system of records, he or she must contact the system manager
with the information described in the notification procedures, identify the specific item(s) to be changed, and
provide a written justification for the change, including any supporting documentation. Requests to amend a record
must meet the requirements of the Department of Education Privacy Act regulations at 34 CFR 5b.7.



Record source categories:



Information is obtained from guaranty agencies, schools, and the Title IV Program Files (Privacy Act System of Records
Number 18-4000-24). However, lenders and guaranty agencies are not a source of information for participants
in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program because the Department maintains individual records of borrowers.



System exempted from certain provisions of the act:



None.

<DOCTITLE>East Tennessee Natural Gas Company; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



December 14, 1994.



Take notice that on December 12, 1994, East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston,
Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. CP95-118-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas
Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity permitting it to construct and operate certain pipeline
loop and compression facilities to ensure continued transportation service to its shippers, all as more fully set
forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

East Tennessee proposes to construct and operate 2.14 miles of 12-inch pipeline loop and 3.02 miles of pipeline loop,
both in Washington County, Virginia as well as uprate three existing turbines at its Compressor Station No. 3110,
in Morgan County, Tennessee to Solar Saturn Model T-1300's, each with an I.S.O. rating of 1360 horsepower, resulting
in an increase of 960 horsepower. East Tennessee estimates a construction cost of $4,264,978, which would be financed
initially with funds on hand, funds generated internally, borrowing under revolving credit agreements or short-term
financing and which would be rolled into permanent financing.

East Tennessee states that its current total firm contractual commitment is approximately 476,507 dt equivalent
of natural gas per day. It is indicated that since 1988 East Tennessee's system has been designed to meet this obligation
in part by receiving approximately 5,000 dt equivalent of natural gas per day from Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation
(Columbia Gas) and delivering it to Roanoke Gas Company (Roanoke) via an interconnect between Roanoke and Columbia
Gas. It is stated that in 1988 East Tennessee and Roanoke entered into an operating agreement specifically providing
that approximately 5,000 dt equivalent of natural gas per day of Roanoke's total transportation quantity of 9,789
dt equivalent of natural gas per day could be delivered to Roanoke at the Columbia Gas interconnect. It is stated that
this arrangement enabled East Tennessee to reduce the volumes that it was required to transport on its system to Roanoke
and thus make those volumes available for East Tennessee's other customers.

East Tennessee states that the operating agreement has expired by its own terms and that Roanoke has advised that it
was not interested in extending the agreement. It is indicated that, as a result of terminated agreement, East Tennessee
now proposes to construct and operate the above-described facilities.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January
4, 1995, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given.

Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for East Tennessee to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

gas measurement facilities. Midwestern states that it will own, operate, and maintain the facilities, and Morgantown
Utilities will reimburse Midwestern an estimated $50,831 for the installation. Midwestern asserts that under the
terms and conditions of its firm and interruptible Rate Schedules, all delivery points on the system are available
to all shippers, and therefore, the facilities will also be available for other transportation services.

Midwestern claims that no significant impact on its system peak day deliveries or its annual entitlements is projected
to result from the proposed delivery point.
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Hold Scoping Meetings on a Proposed Treated
Effluent Water Reuse Project in Central Utah.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and PL 102-575,
Section 205(b), which provides for the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (District) to be considered a ``Federal
Agency'' for the purposes of compliance with all federal fish, wildlife, recreation, and environmental laws with
respect to the use of funds authorized, the District, along with the Department of the Interior as joint lead, will
be preparing an EIS on the impacts of the proposed Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility Water Reuse Project.
The project has been submitted to the District for consideration of funding under Section 207 (Water Management Improvement)
of PL 102-575.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Central Valley Reuse Project (CVRP) will be owned and operated by the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility
Board (Board). Sponsoring agencies include Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake City and the Salt Lake County
Water Conservancy District. The Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility is currently discharging its effluent
to the Jordan River. In October of 1991, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Water Quality notified
the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility Board that effluent discharged from their 62.5 million gallon per
day (mgd) trickling filter/solids contact waste water reclamation facility did not comply with ammonia limits for
discharge to the Jordan River. The Board subsequently contracted for the preparation of a feasibility study on ways
to meet the discharge requirements. 


The proposed waste water reuse project would involve pumping effluent southward from the treatment facility located
in Salt Lake County, Utah for direct irrigation season discharge into existing agricultural irrigation canals.
An estimated 27,600 acre-feet per irrigation season may be delivered. These deliveries would serve to substitute
for contractual Utah Lake irrigation releases, allowing the displaced water to be retained in Utah Lake for a variety
of possible environmental enhancement projects. 
The EIS will analyze the impacts of several alternative locations of pipelines required to deliver the effluent,
impact of use of the conserved water, and delivery points for the treated effluent. The impact of constructing a nitrification
unit (no action alternative) at the treatment plant will also be analyzed. 
The public scoping process will be used to identify the significant issues to be addressed in the EIS, and identify
any additional alternatives or uses of the conserved water that should be considered. A scoping information summary
is available upon request.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental
Take Permit Amendment for the Proposed Canyon Ridge, Phase A, Section 3 Development, Austin, Travis County, TX</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Beard Family Partnership (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an amendment
to their incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been
assigned Permit Number PRT-777083. The requested amendment, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would
authorize the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (

Dendroica chrysoparia

). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction of a residential development on 24 acres, in Austin,
Travis County, Texas. The proposed development will permanently impact about 24 acres of occupied and/or potential
endangered species habitat.



The Service has prepared an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take
application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made
before 30 days from the date of the publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of
the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed development will consist of the construction of residential units (single-family and multi-family
residences) in northwest Travis County, Texas. The propose development will comply with all local, State, and Federal
environmental regulations addressing environmental impacts associated with this type of development.



A conservation plan has been developed as mitigation for the incidental take of golden-cheeked warblers and its habitat.
This plan includes the following features:

 Minimizing clearing of occupied warbler habitat,
 Conducting clearing and construction activities within 300 feet of an occupied warbler territory outside
of the warbler's breeding season,

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941220-2-00028 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941220-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Donating $90,000 for the purchase and dedication (to a conservation entity approved by the Service) of occupied
goldencheeked warbler habitat,
 Providing operational and maintenance funds ($30,000) for the acquired preserve lands,
 Revegetating developed areas with native vegetation, and
 Onsite dedication of conservation easements totalling 2.2 acres in occupied warbler habitat, with these
areas also containing populations of canyon mock-orange (

Philadelphus ernestii

), a candidate (C2) plant species.
In addition to what is proposed by the Applicant, the Service will require the Applicant to complete the following
activities as part of the permit conditions:
1. Provide territorial mapping surveys for the warbler following International Bird Census Committee or other approved
procedures within and 500 feet out from the southern and western boundaries of Phase A, Section 3 in 1995 (where adjacent
landowners will allow). This area will be surveyed in 1996 and 1997 using the protocol established and in effect by
the Service for presence/absence surveys. This survey format of one territorial survey and two presence/absence
surveys will continue until the third breeding season after buildout of the project site, at which time a final territorial
mapping survey will be completed. Buildout for the residential area is considered to be when 95 percent of the houses
are constructed and occupied.
2. The monies identified in the original PRT-777083 and this amendment must be conveyed to an entity approved
by the Service within 30 days of issuance of this amendment.

3. In order to offset the impacts of this development to the maximum extent reasonable and practicable, the Service
believes 48 acres of occupied habitat would be necessary to be purchased and maintained by the Applicant in the Bull
Creek or Cypress Creek watersheld in close proximity to other lands set aside for the conservation of the warbler.
Details of the mitigation proposed are provided in the Canyon Ridge. Phase A, Section 3 Environmental Assessment/Habitat
Conservation Plan. These conservation plan actions ensure that the criteria established for issuance of an incident
take permit will be fully satisfied.

The Applicant considered four alternatives, including an alternate site location, alternate site design, delaying
development until a regional section 10(a)(1)(B) permit is issued, and no action. Details of the mitigation are provided
in the Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan for the Canyon Ridge, Phase A Development.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





GPU Nuclear Corporation; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-16, issued to GPU Nuclear Corporation (GPUN/the licensee) for operation of the Oyster Creek
Nuclear Generating Station (OCNGS) located in Ocean County, New Jersey.
The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification 5.3.1.E to allow 2645 fuel assemblies to be stored in
the fuel pool. This is an increase of 45 fuel assemblies from the current limit of 2600. The 45 additional storage location
currently exist in the racks in the fuel pool. They were included in the re-racking project allowed by License Amendment
No. 76 but were not incorporated in the Technical Specifications since, at the time, it was believed they would not
be needed.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



1. 

The operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
There are no changes in the existing provisions for load handling in the vicinity of the spent fuel pool associated
with the proposed increase in licensed storage capacity. OCNGS Technical Specification 5.3.1.B limits the loads
carried over the spent fuel pool to no greater than the weight of one fuel assembly. Therefore, accidents involving
the mispositioning or drop of a fuel assembly establish the extent of accident probability or consequences. The Abnormal
Positioning of a Fuel Assembly Outside the Storage Rack and the Dropped Fuel Assembly accident scenarios are addressed
as follows:
a. The probability of occurrence of the above accidents is not affected by the racks themselves or the stored fuel.
Since no physical changes are being made to the racks, an increase in licensed storage capacity cannot increase the
probability of these accidents.
b. The consequences of abnormal positioning of a fuel assembly outside the storage rack were evaluated. Since the
storage rack criticality calculations were made using an infinite array of storage cells with no neutron leakage,
positioning a fuel assembly outside and adjacent to the actual finite rack can add reactivity, but would, because
of neutron leakage, result in a lower K

eff

 than the K

oo

 calculated for the infinite array. Thus, additional stored fuel assemblies will not increase consequences of this
type of accident than those previously evaluated.
c. The consequences of a dropped fuel assembly striking either the base of the rack or the top of a storage location and
the reactivity effects were also evaluated in the licensing report supporting Amendment 76. In all cases, the evaluated
integrity of the racks was not exceeded. Also, the dropped fuel assembly did not constitute a criticality hazard because
the infinite multiplication factor of the fuel storage racks was not materially altered. An increase in fuel enrichment
does not increase consequences since the GE-9 assemblies' mechanical specifications are bounded by previous
designs and consequences are not dependent on U-235 enrichment. Thus, since no physical alteration of the storage
racks is necessary to store 45 additional fuel assemblies the consequences of this type of accident are not increased.
2. 

The operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
The increase in licensed spent fuel pool storage capacity involves the addition of 45 fuel assemblies. The increased
structural loading has already been accounted for in the analyses reviewed by the NRC staff in support of Amendment
76. There are no physical changes to the fuel pool cooling. These systems are capable of handling the additional duty
originating from the additional fuel. Criticality accidents or malfunctions also do not change because the analysis
assumes an infinite array of fuel and Boraflex gaps have been conservatively accounted for. Therefore, there is no
possibility for an accident or malfunction of a different type than previously evaluated.
3. The operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
The margin of safety, when applied to a storage expansion, needs to address nuclear criticality, thermal-hydraulic,
mechanical, material and structural adequacy.


Nuclear Criticality


The acceptance criterion for criticality as established in Technical Specification 5.3.1.A, is that the neutron
multiplication factor shall be less than or equal to 0.95, including all uncertainties.
Since the increase in licensed capacity to 2,600 storage locations, the maximum allowable average enrichment was
increased twice. The original analysis was for 3.01% U-235 enrichment fuel with no credit for Gd

2

0

3

. Subsequent analyses increased the maximum allowable enrichment to 3.8% and then 4.0% U-235. Both analyses
take credit for Gd

2

0

3

 requiring a minimum of 7 (seven) rods containing 3.0% or more Gd

2

0

3

.
Subsequent to the rack installation, an industry concern was raised with the discovery of the formation of gaps in
Boraflex panels. The problem of gap formation in the boraflex and its impact on criticality has been addressed. The
criticality analysis was updated to take into account the presence of gaps, including projected gap formation is
coplanar. The fuel pool K

eff

 for the 4.0% U-235 enriched fuel with at least 7 (seven) Gd

2

0

3

 rods at peak reactivity is 0.9174 and increases to 0.945 with 3.9 inch coplanar gaps in the Boraflex which is below the
0.95 limit. Oyster Creek maintains a Boraflex surveillance program to ensure the assumptions used in the analysis
remain valid.
Since all criticality analyses were performed with an infinite lattice, it is valid for a spent fuel pool capacity
of 2,645 fuel assemblies. Therefore, there is no decrease in the margin of safety.

Thermal-Hydraulic



The heat load analysis performed for the expansion to 2600 licensed storage locations considered all 2,645 actual
storage locations filled. Therefore, the initial conclusions are not changed and no re-analysis is required. The
thermal-hydraulic calculations which used 125
  F pool water temperature, have shown that the cladding temperatures (<219
  F) will be well below the local fuel pool water saturation temperature of approximately 240
  F. The maximum cladding temperatures will be low enough to preclude nucleate boiling.

Analysis has demonstrated that with an abnormal heat load from 2,732 fuel assemblies in the spent fuel pool, the temperature
of the pool will be maintained within the Technical Specification limit to 125
  F. Therefore, since this limit will be maintained, other restrictions such as the temperature differential
of the spent fuel pool liner will also be maintained. Thus, there is no reduction in the margin of safety from a thermal-hydraulic
point of view.





Mechanical and Structural



The additional 45 storage locations were part of the fuel pool expansion of which only 2,600 fuel assemblies were licensed
for storage. The fuel storage racks are designed to maintain the spent fuel assemblies in a safe configuration through
all environmental and abnormal loadings, such as an SSE or impact due to spent fuel assembly drop. Structural and seismic
analyses of the racks have established margins against tilting, deflection or movement to preclude impact of the
racks with each other or with the pool walls. It is shown that the rack modules will undergo infinitesimal rotations
if seismic excitation 50% over the SSE loading are imposed. The threshold of kinematic instability is not even approached.

Analyses performed to arrive at the above conclusions indicate that margins in all areas of structural concern exist.
The racks are placed in the pool as individual stand-alone structures, do not load pool walls directly, and are uncoupled
from pool liner temperature rise.

To limit the out-of-phase motion of adjacent racks due to non-symmetric loading of the racks, Oyster Creek procedures
for loading spent fuel pool racks require the racks to be loaded symmetrically, i.e. the total fuel assemblies stored
in any one quadrant of a rack will not deviate by more than 10% of the average of the four quadrants. This limitation will
remain in effect for storage of 2,645 fuel assemblies.

In summary, the additional 45 fuel bundles in storage will not decrease structural margins since there is no associated
physical change to the storage facility and the 2,645 fuel assemblies were considered in the original analysis which
demonstrated that the acceptance criteria were met.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appear that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 

By January 19, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC, and at the local public document room located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington
Street, Toms River, New Jersey 08753. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above
date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

No later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Phillip F. McKee: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Ernest L. Blake, Jr., Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, 2300 N Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20037 attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

The Commission hereby provides notice that this is a proceeding on an application for a license amendment falling
within the scope of section 134 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), 42 U.S.C. 10154. Under section 134 of
the NWPA, the Commission, at the request of any party to the proceeding must use hybrid hearing procedures with respect
to ``any matter which the Commission determines to be in controversy among the parties.'' The hybrid procedures in
section 134 provide for oral argument on matters in controversy, proceeded by discovery under the Commission's rules,
and the designation, following argument, of only those factual issues that involve a genuine and substantial dispute,
together with any remaining questions of law, to be resolved in an adjudicatory hearing. Actual adjudicatory hearings
are to be held on those issues found to meet the criteria of section 134 and set for hearing after oral argument.

The Commission's rules implementing section 134 of the NWPA are found in 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart K, ``Hybrid Hearing
Procedures for Expansion of Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage Capacity at Civilian Nuclear Power Reactors'' (published
at 50 FR 41670, October 15, 1985) to 10 CFR 2.1101 

et seq

. Under those rules, any party to the proceeding may invoke the hybrid hearing procedures by filing with the presiding
officer a written request for oral argument under 10 CFR 2.1109. To be timely, the request must be filed within 10 days
of an order granting a request for hearing or petition to intervene. (As outlined above, the Commission's rules in
10 CFR Part 2, Subpart G, and 2.714 in particular, continue to govern the filing of requests for a hearing or petitions
to intervene, as well as the admission of contentions.) The presiding officer shall grant a timely request for oral
argument. The presiding officer may grant untimely request for oral argument only upon showing of good cause by the
requesting party for the failure to file on time and after providing the other parties an opportunity to respond to
the untimely request. If the presiding officer grants a request for oral argument, any hearing held on the application
shall be concluded in accordance with hybrid hearing procedures. In essence, those procedures limit the time available
for discovery and require that an oral argument be held to determine whether any contentions must be resolved in adjudicatory
hearing. If no party to the proceedings requests oral argument, or if all untimely requests for oral argument are denied,
then the usual procedures in 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart G, apply.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 25, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington DC, and at the local public document room located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department,

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power & Light Company; Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, et al.; Environmental Assessment
and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-71, DPR-62, DPR-23, NPF-63, issued
to the Carolina Power & Light Company (the licensee) for the operation of the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant,
Units 1 and 2 (Brunswick), H.B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2 (Robinson), and Shearon Harris Nuclear Power
Plant, Unit 1 (Harris).

The facilities consist of two boiling water reactors at the Brunswick site in Brunswick County, North Carolina; a
pressurized water reactor at the Robinson site in Darlington County, South Carolina; and a pressurized water reactor
in Wake County and Chatham County, North Carolina.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of the Proposed Action



The exemption would allow implementation of a hand geometry biometric system of site access control so that photograph
identification badges can be taken offsite. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application
for exemption dated July 29, 1994, as supplemented December 5, 1994.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action would give an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical
protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage.''

Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55(a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security
organization. Paragraph 1 of 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' specifies that the ``licensee shall control
all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' Title 10 of the 

Code of Federal Regulations,

 paragraph 73.55(d)(5), specifies that ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals
who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' Paragraph 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual
not employed by the licensee (i.e., a contractor) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided
the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from
the protected area.''

Currently, unescorted access into protected areas of the Brunswick and Robinson units is controlled through the
use of a photograph on a combination badge and keycard (hereafter, these are referred to as the badge). At the Harris
unit unescorted access into protected areas is controlled through the use of a photograph on a badge and a separate
keycard. The security officers at each entrance station use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual
requesting access. The badges for both licensee employees and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted
access are issued upon entrance at each entrance/exit location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and
are retrievable at each entrance/exit location. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contract individuals are
not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance with the plants' physical security plans, neither licensee employees
nor contractors are allowed to take badges offsite.

The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access
to keep their badges with them when departing the site. An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to permit contractors
to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site.

Under the proposed system, individuals who are authorized for unescorted entry into protected areas would have the
physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control
system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system
would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared
with the previously stored template to verify authorization for entry. Individuals, including licensee employees
and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart the site.

Based on a Sandia report entitled ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices'' (SAND91-0276
UC-906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991) and on the licensee's experience with the current photo identification
system, the licensee demonstrated that the proposed hand geometry system would provide enhanced site access control.
Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would
provide for a positive verification process. Potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of taking the badge
offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into the protected area. The licensee will implement a process for
testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent to that specified in the
regulation. The Physical Security Plans for the Brunswick, Robinson, and Harris sites will be revised to include
implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow licensee employees and contractors
to take their badges offsite.

The access will continue to be under the observation of security personnel. A numbered picture badge identification
system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escorts.
Badges will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change does not affect nonradiological plant effluents
and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that this proposed action would
result in no significant radiological environmental impact.

The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of
any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative
occupational radiation explosure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does involve features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternatives to the proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would have no effect on the environmental impact, would not enhance
the protection of the environment, and would result in an unjustified loss of cost savings to the licensee.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statements

<DOCTITLE>Yankee Atomic Electric Company; Yankee Nuclear Power Station; Issuance of Environmental Assessment and Finding
of No Significant Impact </DOCTITLE>

 

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuing an order authorizing the decommissioning
of the Yankee Nuclear Power Station (YNPS or plant), that is licensed to the Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC or
the licensee) located in Franklin County, Massachusetts. 

 

Description of Proposed Action 

 

YNPS has been shut down since October 1, 1991, and was defueled during February 1992. 

 

Finding of No Significant Impact 

 

The staff has reviewed the proposed decommissioning against the requirements in 10 CFR Part 51. Upon conducting an
Environmental Assessment, the staff concluded that no significant environmental impacts are associated with the
proposed SAFSTOR and DECON decommissioning and that the proposed decommissioning will not significantly affect
the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.13, not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed decommissioning of the YNPS. 

 The following documents contain further details on this action: (1) The application from the licensee of December
20, 1993, as supplemented August 5, August 22, October 24, and October 26, 1994; (2) the Commission's related Safety
Evaluation; and (3) the Commission's Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact.

<DOCTITLE>Trade Policy Staff Committee; Generalized System of Preferences; Initiation of a Review of ``Reverse Preferences'';
Termination of the Reviews of Worker Rights Practices and the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights in the Dominican
Republic</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice and solicitation of public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Uruguay Round Trade Agreements Act (UR Act) renewed the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program until
July 31, 1995. The Statement of Administrative Action (SAA) that accompanies the UR Act provides that USTR will initiate
a review to determine whether any GSP beneficiary country affords preferential treatment, as a result of an economic
association agreement or otherwise, to the products of a developed country, other than the United States, that has,
or is likely to have, an adverse effect on U.S. commerce. This notice announces the review and invites public comments.


This notice also announces the successful termination of the reviews of worker rights practices and the protection
of intellectual property rights (IPR) in the Dominican Republic.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background



The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for specified products that are imported from designated
developing countries. The GSP program is authorized by Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``GSP law'')
(19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.). The GSP law expired on September 30, 1994, but the UR Act extended the current GSP program without
modification until July 31, 1995.

When the GSP program was originally enacted in 1974, the Congress was concerned about giving duty-free privileges
to some developing countries that, in turn, treat imports from some developed countries more favorably than imports
from the United States. Such favorable treatment is called a ``reverse preference,'' and it discriminates against
U.S. export interests.

Accordingly, section 502(b)(3) of the GSP law provides that the President shall not designate a country as a GSP beneficiary
if the country ``affords preferential treatment to the products of a developed country, other than the United States,
which has, or is likely to have, a significant adverse effect on United States commerce.''

<PARENT> FR941220-2-00027 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Congressional and Administration concern about the adverse effect of discriminatory ``reverse preferences''
on U.S. commerce has been rekindled by recent complaints about ``reverse preferences'' that are allegedly granted
to imports from the European Union (EU) by some agreements between the EU and countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
Therefore, as provided in the SAA that accompanies the UR Act, the Administration intends to conduct a full review
of ``reverse preferences'' that may be granted by beneficiaries of the GSP program.



II. GSP Review



The SAA provides that, upon enactment, USTR will initiate a GSP review to determine whether any GSP beneficiary grants
preferential treatment to imports from another developed country that has, or is likely to have, an adverse effect
on U.S. commerce. This review will consider ``reverse preferences'' granted by any GSP beneficiary, but it is expected
to focus principally, although not exclusively, on countries in Central and Eastern Europe that have association
agreements with the EU.

USTR is directed to solicit public comments and to seek information from U.S. Embassies in GSP beneficiary countries.
Ninety days thereafter, USTR will determine whether the ``reverse preferences'' granted by a GSP beneficiary have
or may have an adverse effect on U.S. export interests sufficient to warrant further review. If so, USTR will enter
into bilateral consultations with that country with the goal of eliminating the ``reverse preferences.'' Nine months
later, USTR will make a determination of whether the ``reverse preferences'' have, or are likely to have, a significant
adverse effect on U.S. commerce.

If USTR makes an affirmative determination, the country's status as a beneficiary developing country will be withdrawn
or suspended, unless the country has agreed to eliminate the significant adverse effect. The review will terminate
if the determination is negative.



III. Public Comments



Interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding discriminatory ``reverse preferences'' that are granted
by a GSP beneficiary country, and their effect on U.S. commerce. Interested parties are invited to report on any association
agreements, or similar agreements, under which a GSP beneficiary country grants preferential treatment to products
of another developed country, that has or may have an adverse effect on U.S. export interests. Preferential treatment
may include preferential tariff treatment, as well as preferential non-tariff treatment (e.g., quotas). Interested
parties are urged to give specific examples of U.S. export interests that have been adversely affected by ``reverse
preferences.''

In particular, interested parties are urges to be as specific as possible about: (1) Any product that is subject to
different rates of duty by a GSP beneficiary country depending upon whether the product is imported from the United
States or another developed country, such as the EU; (2) the various, actual, applicable rates of duty (i.e., bound,
applied, preferential), as well as any scheduled rate reduction; (3) the level of trade in the subject product that
the United States and other developed countries have with the GSP beneficiary; and (4) the size of the market in the
beneficiary country.

Comments must be submitted in 15 copies, in English, to the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee, Trade Policy Staff Committee,
600 17th Street, N.W., Room 513, Washington, D.C. 20506. Comments must be received no later than 5 p.m. on Wednesday,
January 25, 1995. Information and comments will be subject to public inspection by appointment with the staff of the
USTR Public Reading Room, except for information granted ``business confidential'' status pursuant to 15 CFR 2003.6
and 2007.7. If the document contains business confidential information, 15 copies of a nonconfidential version
of the submission along with 15 copies of the confidential version must be submitted. The confidential version of
the submission should be clearly marked ``Submitted in Confidence'' at the top and bottom of each and every page of
the document. A nonconfidential summary of the confidential information must be included with the confidential
submission, along with a written explanation of why the confidential material should be protected. The version which
does not contain business confidential information (the public version) should also be clearly marked at the top
and bottom of each and every page (either ``public version'' or ``non-confidential'').



IV. Dominican Republic



In the 1993 Annual GSP Review, the GSP Subcommittee reviewed the worker rights practices and the adequacy and effectiveness
of IPR protection in the Dominican Republic. Notwithstanding evidence of some progress on worker rights and IPR protection
in the Dominican Republic during the course of the review, these two cases are continued when the results of the 1993
Annual GSP Review were announced on July 1, 1994. Since that decision, the Dominican Republic has made considerable
progress on worker rights and has continued to make progress on IPR protection. In September, the Motion Picture Export
Association of America, the domestic petitioner in the IPR case, withdrew its petition. In October, the AFL-CIO,
the domestic petitioner in the worker rights case, withdrew its petition. Based on the continuing progress on worker
rights and IPR protection in the Dominican Republic, as well as the withdrawal of the two petitions, the GSP reviews
have been terminated.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change
by the Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated Relating to the Rules for the Listing and Trading of Stock Index and Currency
Warrants



December 12, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 3, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organizations Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to (1) amend Article XXVIII, Rule 8 to revise the listing criteria for stock index (``stock index''
or ``index'') warrants and currency warrants (``currency warrants''),
 (2) add a new Part V to the Rules of the Exchange to provide rules for the trading of index warrants, and (3) amend Article
X, Rule 3 of the Exchange's rules to specify the customer margin requirements for the purchase or short sale of index
warrants. On Dec. 5, 1994, the CHX amended certain surveillance related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote
3, 

infra.







II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization
has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Purpose



The Exchange proposes to: (1) amend its listing guidelines for stock index and currency warrants, (2) establish various
new rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants, and (3) establish special customer margin requirements
for positions in stock index and currency warrants.



Description of the Proposed Rules



CHX seeks to amend Article XXVIII, Rule 8 of the Exchange's rules to provide a higher standard for warrant issuers than
currently exists. Specifically, future warrant issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth in
excess of $150,000,000. Moreover, the aggregate original issue price of all of a particular issuer's warrant offerings
(combined with offerings by its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or on NASDAQ would not
be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The proposed amendment will require that each warrant issue will
be automatically exercised on either the delisting date (if the issue is not listed upon another organized securities
market) or upon expiration. Article XXVIII, Rule 8 also will be amended to provide that, for stock index warrants where
25 percent or more of the value of the underlying index is represented by securities that are traded primarily in the
U.S., the opening prices of the U.S. traded securities in the index will be used to determine the settlement value of
the underlying index.

Article X, Rule 3 is being amended to apply the customer margin requirements used for broad based index and currency
options to index warrants and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants
will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent
of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less
the amount by which the warrant is out of the money up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency
warrants similarly will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes
that the index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered
positions.

<DOCNO> FR941220-2-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941220-2-00028 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Article LI is being amended to add definitions related to the listing, trading, and margin requirements of stock index,
currency, and currency index warrants.

Proposed Part V of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Article
LIII, Rule 1 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific rule in Part V applies, the provisions
of the Constitution and all other rules and policies of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities.

Proposed Article LIII, Rule 2 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for
the purchase or sale of an index or currency warrant unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading
pursuant to Exchange Article XXVIII, Rule 3.

Proposed Article LIII, Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 require that the options rules for suitability, discretionary account
trading, supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock index and currency warrants.

Proposed Article LIII, Rule 7 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements,
sales literature and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency
warrants. The rule further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining
to stock index and currency warrants.

Proposed Article LIII, Rule 8 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original
issue prices of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. In addition, with respect
to warrants on the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Index, the position limit will be seven and one half million warrants
covering all such issues, provided the original issue prices of the warrants are not greater than $10. Further, with
respect to warrants on the Russell 2000 Index, the position limit will be twelve and one half million warrants. The
rule provides that warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or more will be weighted more heavily than warrants
with an original issue price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule gives the Exchange the
authority to require the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits
set forth in the rule, and commentary to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position
limits.

Proposed Article LIII, Rule 9 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock
index options and states that such limits are separate and distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by
the issuers of stock index warrants.

Proposed Article LIII, Rule 10, requires that the trading halt provisions in Article IX, Rule 10A shall be applied
to the trading of stock index warrants.

Upon SEC approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes that it will only file rule changes for specific
warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying index already listed on a national
securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option or warrant overlies a particular broad based index,
the Exchange proposes it be able to list warrants on that index without further SEC review and approval pursuant to
Section 19(b) of the Act.

Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities
in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American depositary receipts (``ADRs'')
overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the
CHX and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.
 Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing
guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling
transactions in index or currency warrants.





The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
goals of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system. 



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 

 

Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 

 (A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 

 (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 

 

IV. Solicitation of Comments 

 

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth
Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the above-referenced self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to file number in the caption
above and should be submitted by January 10, 1995.

 

 
For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Securities Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Proposed Rule Change Implementing a Fixed Income Transaction System Automated Book Entry Feature for
Municipal Bonds</DOCTITLE>


December 13, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on October 21, 1994, the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed with the Securities
and exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared primarily by MSTC. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from
interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


MSTC proposes to adopt a new automated book entry feature for municipal bonds.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


Under the proposed rule filing, MSTC proposes to adopt an automated book entry movement feature to work in conjunction
with the Midwest Clearing Corporation's (``MCC'') interface
 with the National Securities Clearing Corporation's (``NSCC'') fixed income transaction system (``FITS'') for
municipal securities.
 The book entry movement feature for municipal securities transactions compared through FITS will be similar in functionality
and procedure to the current institutional delivery system where book entry delivery is set up in advance for automatic
settlement on settlement date. A municipal bond trade entered for comparison into FITS will be set up for automatice
book entry delivery once the trade achieves a compared status as long as the settlement date entered for the trade is
a date in the future of the trade date. New issue or unusual trade types that compare without a settlement date or items
that compare on or after settlement date will not be subject to automatice book entry delivery. These exception items
must be submitted manually.





Participants will have the flexibility to specify the position from which an automatic book entry delivery should
originate. MSTC expects that this decision often will be based on the most frequently used safekeeping position as
identified on the participant's account profile. Participants will have the option of changing this standing origination
location as necessary.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


MSTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
 of the Act requires the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions. The Commission believes that the automated book entry delivery feature should help
promote prompt and accurate clearing and settlement by reducing errors by automatically generating book entry movements
on behalf of the delivering MSTC participants for compared trades. Section 17A(a)(2)(A)(i)
 of the Act directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that the proposal furthers this goal
by creating cooperation by automating the process of trades being cleared and settled at Midwest Clearing Corporation
and MSTC.





MSTC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule change because accelerated approval will allow MSTC participants to utilize and to take full advantage in a more
timely fashion of the benefits of the automated book entry movement feature for municipal securities.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth
Street, N.W., Washington D.C. 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 5th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available
at the principal office MSTC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-MSTC-94-14 and should
be submitted by January 10, 1995.


It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSTC-94-14)
be, and hereby is, approved.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Securities Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Legal Expert System</DOCTITLE>



December 13, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on November 29, 1994, the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared primarily by MSTC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organizations Statement of the Terms and Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed change is to change the pricing structure of the Legal Expert System and to clarify MSTC's
policies with regard to the use of the Legal Expert System.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



MSTC proposes to amend a portion of its services and the schedule of charges relating to the Legal Expert System. MSTC
also proposes to clarify its existing policy with respect to the use of the Legal Expert System by participants.

The Legal Expert System is a computer program available to MSTC participants which details the necessary documentation
for effecting a legal transfer of securities based on industry criteria and individual state regulations. First,
MSTC wishes to clarify that the Legal Expert System is available only to full MSTC participants; accordingly, it is
not available to pledgee participants or limited purpose participants. Furthermore, the Legal Expert System is
proprietary to MSTC; therefore, participants may not provide third parties with access to the Legal Expert System
without MSTC's prior written approval. The new schedule of charges will be effective January 1, 1995.

The text of the proposed rule change is as follows with additions italicized and with deletions bracketed:

MSTC Legal Expert System



[Participants that make inquiries in the Legal Expert System: $750/month]



Terminal Inquiry



1-2500 inquiries per month: $0.50/inquiry

2,501-5,000: $0.35/inquiry

5,001-10,000: $0.35/inquiry

10,001 and over: $0.17/inquiry





MSTC full legal deposit participants will receive a free inquiry for each legal deposit submitted to MSTC. The free
inquiries are only valid in the month the legal deposit is made.

The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable fees and other charges among participants using its facilities.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



MSTC believes that no burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



MSTC has not solicited or received any comments. MSTC will notify the Commission of any written comments it receives.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)
 of the Act and Rule 19b-4(e)
 thereunder in that it constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration,
or enforcement of an existing rule and in that it establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by MSTC.
At any time within sixty days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may abrogate the rule
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.






IV. Solicitation of Comments

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change
by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Establishment of Uniform Listing and Trading Guidelines for
Stock Index and Currency Warrants</DOCTITLE>



December 12, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 9, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines for stock index (``stock index'' or ``index'') warrants
and currency warrants (``currency warrants'');
 (2) establish various new rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants; and (3) establish special customer
margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants. On Dec. 8, 1994, the NYSE amended certain
surveillance related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote 3, infra.





The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, NYSE and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The NYSE proposes (1) to add a new Rule 414 (Index and Currency Warrants) in order (a) to prescribe procedures for approving
and supervising accounts that trade currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants and (b)
to prescribe stock index warrant position and exercise limits, (2) to replace Supplementary Material .30 to Rule
405 (Diligence to Accounts), which contains provisions that the proposed rule change proposes to supersede, with
a cross reference to proposed Rule 414, (3) to amend existing Rule 431 (Margin Requirements) to modify currency warrant
and stock index warrant margin requirements and to establish currency index warrant margin requirements, (4) to
amend Para. 703.15 (Foreign Currency Warrants and Currency Index Warrants) of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual
to modify the listing standards for currency warrants and to establish listing standards for currency index warrants,
and (5) to amend Para. 703.17 (Stock Index Warrants Listing Standards) of the Exchange's Listed Company manual to
modify the listing standards for stock index warrants.

The provisions of proposed Rule 414 include (a) provisions governing the approval, supervision and suitability
of customers, which for the most part follow the Rules that the Exchange applies in respect of trading in stock index
options, and (b) stock index warrant position limits. It also includes a newly added stock index warrant exercise
limit. A more detailed discussion of the provisions of the proposed rule change follows.

Paragraph (a) of Rule 414 defines relevant terms.

Paragraph (b) of Rule 414 specifies that the Rule applies to Exchange trading in currency warrants, currency index
warrants and stock index warrants and that other Exchange Rules and the Exchange's Constitution also so apply.

Paragraph (c) of Rule 414 establishes position limits for stock index warrants. For a position of stock index warrants
with an original issue price of $10 or less, the position limit is 15 million index warrants. For a position of stock
index warrants with an original issue price in excess of $10, the number of such warrants is converted to the equivalent
number of warrants that the position would contain if the issuer had originally priced the issue at $10. Thus, 1 million
stock index warrants with an original issue price of $20 would represent the equivalent of 2 million stock index warrants
with an original issue price of $10 ($20/$10  x  1 million stock index warrants) and the 15 million stock index
warrant position limit would apply to the 2 million stock index warrant ``equivalents.'' Paragraph (c) also provides
procedures for allowing limited exceptions to those position limits as circumstances warrant.

Paragraph (d) of Rule 414 imposes exercise limits on stock index warrants equal to the position limits. The exercise
limits are separate and distinct from any limits the issuer of the stock index warrant may impose.

Paragraph (e) of Rule 414 applies the options rule counterpart to stock index warrant trading halts.

Paragraph (f) of Rule 414 requires a member or member organization to have approved an account for options trading
pursuant to the standards and procedures set forth in Rule 721 (Opening of Accounts) before the account can trade currency
warrants, currency index warrants and/or stock index warrants. Paragraphs (g), (h), (i) and (j) of Rule 414 apply
options rule counterparts to trading in currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants in the
areas of supervision of accounts (see Rule 722 (Supervision of Accounts)), suitability (see Rule 723 (Suitability)),
discretionary accounts (see Rule 724 (Discretionary Accounts)), and customer complaints (see Rule 732 (Customer
Complaints)).

Paragraph (k) of Rule 414 applies the options rule counterpart (see Rule 791 (Communications to Customers)) to communications
to customers relating to currency warrants, currency index warrants and/or stock index warrants. In addition, Paragraph
(k) requires those communications to state that currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants,
unlike standardized options, are subject to issuer's credit risks and warrant terms and conditions that may differ
from those that apply to other warrant issues overlying the same currency or index. The paragraph also advises that
the prospectus requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 apply to certain communications.

Paragraph (1) of Rule 414 requires that, where 25 percent or more of the value of an underlying index stock group is represented
by securities of United States issuers, the calculation of a stock index warrant's settlement value must use the opening
prices of those securities on the U.S. markets.

Supplementary Material .30 to Rule 405 is amended to cross-reference Rule 414 and to delete (a) the statement that
the suitability requirements of Rule 723 apply to stock index warrants and (b) the recommendation that the account
approval requirements of Rule 721 be applied to stock index warrants. Paragraphs (f) and (h) of Rule 414 supersede
those notions.

The Exchange proposes to amend those portions of the Rule 431 margin requirements that apply to margin on foreign currency
options and options on broad index stock groups so as to apply the same margin requirements to currency warrants and
stock index warrants, respectively, and to establish currency index warrant margin requirements. For example,
stock index warrants will follow broad index options in requiring margin of (A) 100 percent of the current market value
of all ``long'' stock index warrants and (B) in the case of ``short'' positions in stock index warrants, (1) 100 percent
of the current value of the option plus (2) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying index stock group multiplied
by the applicable index multiplier. The Exchange proposes that its margin requirements be permitted offset treatment
for spread, straddle and covered positions.






The Exchange proposes to amend Para. 703.15 of the Listed Company Manual, which currently provides listing standards
for foreign currency warrants, to cause it to apply to currency index warrants. The Exchange also proposes to amend
Para 703.15 and Para. 703.17 of the Listed Company Manual (A) to change the issuer ``substantiality'' requirement
for $100 million in assets to $150 million in tangible net worth, (B) to specify that the issuer is expected to refrain
from issuing warrants where its aggregate currency and index warrant offerings exceed 25 percent of its net worth
and (C) to require in-the-money currency and index warrants to be automatically exercised at expiration if not otherwise
exercised.

In listing new stock index warrant or currency index warrant issues for trading on the Exchange, the Exchange would
submit a proposed rule change only where a warrant issue overlies an index on which warrants or options are not already
listed, whether on the Exchange or on another self-regulatory organization. Thus, an Exchange would list for trading
index warrants on indexes that already underlie listed options or warrants without further Commission review and
approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants
will require that no more than 20% of the securities in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign
securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the NYSE and the primary
exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.
 Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing
guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling
transactions in index or currency warrants.





The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is the requirement under Section 6(b)(5) that an exchange have
rules that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions
in securities, and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general,
to protect investors and the public interest.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NYSE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the 1934 Act.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 



The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on the proposed rule change. The Exchange
has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or 

(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by January 10, 1995.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to the Mailing of Interim Financial Statements to Shareholders</DOCTITLE>



December 12, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 1, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NYSE is proposing amendments to Para. 203.02 of its Listed Company Manual (the ``Manual'') regarding the mailing
of interim financial statements to shareholders of listed companies. The rule, as amended, would state that corporations
that distribute interim reports to shareholders should distribute such reports to both registered and beneficial
shareholders.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



Currently, the Exchange requires listed companies to publish interim earnings statements as press reports, but
does not require that such statements also be sent to shareholders. The practices of listed companies vary: Some companies
mail these reports to all shareholders, some mail only to registered holders, and some companies do not mail interim
reports at all.

Various groups, including the American Society of Corporate Secretaries and the Securities Industry Association,
have been reviewing this area in an attempt to achieve some uniformity among listed companies with respect to their
dissemination of interim earnings reports to shareholders. In balancing the benefit of requiring that these reports
be mailed to all shareholders, and the high cost of doing so, particularly as to ``street name'' holders, a compromise
position developed. While companies would continue not to be required to mail interim reports to shareholders, if
a company did conduct such a mailing, it was believed to be fair that such reports be mailed to both registered and beneficial
holders.

The compromise position is proposed as an amendment to Para. 203.02 of the Manual in the discussion of reporting and
disclosure by listed companies.

2. Statutory Basis



The basis under the Act for this proposed rule change is the requirement under section 6(b)(5) that an exchange have
rules that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling,
processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors
and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



This proposed rule change does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on this proposed rule change. The Exchange
has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 55 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change
by the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Establishment of Uniform Listing and Trading Guidelines for Stock
Index and Currency Warrants </DOCTITLE>



 December 12, 1994. 



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 22, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The Exchange proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines for stock index (``stock index'' or ``index'') warrants
and currency warrants (``currency warrants'');
 (2) establish various new rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants; and (3) establish special customer
margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants. On Dec. 5, 1994, the PSE amended certain surveillance
related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote 3, 

infra

. 





The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PSE, and at the Commission. 



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item
IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Section (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The PSE proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines and establish uniform rules for the trading of stock index and
currency warrants, and (2) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency
warrants. 

The PSE seeks to amend Rule 7.18 to provide higher standards for warrant issuers than currently exists. In particular,
future warrant issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth in excess of $150 million. In addition,
the aggregate original issue price of all of a particular issuer's warrant offerings (combined with offerings by
its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are National Market securities traded through
NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The proposed amendment will require that each
warrant issue will be automatically exercised on either the delisting date (if the issue is not listed upon another
organized securities market) or upon expiration. Rule 7.18 also will be amended to provide that opening prices (``a.m.
settlement'') for all U.S. traded securities will be used to determine an index's settlement value where 25 percent
or more of the value of the index is represented by securities whose primary trading market is in the U.S. 

Rule 2.16 is being amended to apply the current customer margin requirements for broad based stock index and currency
options to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants
will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent
of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less
the amount by which the warrant is out of the money up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency
warrants will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that
its stock index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and
covered positions.
 Proposed Rule 8 of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Rule
8.1 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific provision of Rule 8 applies, the provisions
of the Constitution and all other rules and polices of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities. 





Proposed Rule 8.4 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for the purchase
or sale of index or currency warrants unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading pursuant
to Exchange Rule 9.18(b). Furthermore, proposed Rules 8.5-8.8 require that the option rules pertaining to
suitability, discretionary account trading, supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock
index and currency warrants. 

Proposed Rule 8.9 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales literature
and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. The rule
further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock index and
currency warrants. 

Proposed Rule 8.10 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original issue prices
of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. The rule provides that warrants with
an original issue price greater than ten dollars will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an original issue
price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule also gives the Exchange the authority to require
the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits set forth in the rule,
and Commentary to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position limits.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941220-2-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941220-2-00033 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Proposed Rule 8.11 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock index options
and states that such limits are separate and distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by the issuers of
stock index warrants.
Proposed Rule 8.12 requires that the trading halt provisions in Rule 7.11 shall be applied to trading in stock index
warrants.
Upon Commission approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes it will only file rule changes for specific
warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying broad based index already
listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option overlies a particular broad
based index, the Exchange proposes it be able to list warrants on that index without further Commission review and
approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.
Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities
in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')
overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the
PSE and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.
 Furthermore, Commentary .01 to Proposed Rule 2.16 provides that stock index and currency warrants listed on the Exchange
prior to SEC approval of this filing shall continue to be governed by those provisions of the Exchange's rules that
were applicable to such warrants prior to approval of this filing. Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants,
the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities
(including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in index or currency warrants.




The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it will facilitate transactions in securities.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes a burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the PSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-PSE-94-28
and should be submitted by January 10, 1995.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change
by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Establishment of Uniform Listing and Trading Guidelines
for Stock Index and Currency Warrants</DOCTITLE>



December 12, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 30, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx proposes to amend: (1) Rule 803(e) to revise the listing criteria for stock index (``stock index'' or ``index'')
warrants and currency warrants (``currency warrants'');
 (2) Rule 722 to specify the customer margin for the purchase or short sale of index and currency warrants; (3) Option
Rules 1001, 1002, 1024, 1025, 1047A, 1049, and 1070 thereby extending these trade practice rules to currency and index
warrants; and (4) Rule 1000 to add applicable definitions. On Dec. 2, 1994, the Phlx amended certain surveillance
related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote 3, 

infra.







The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Phlx and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Purpose of this rule change is to: (1) amend listing guidelines for stock index and currency warrants, (2) amend
various rules thereby extending their applicability to index and currency warrants trading, and (3) establish special
customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants.

The Phlx seeks to amend its listing standards for currency and index warrants. Phlx Rule 803(e) will provide that issuers
must have a minimum tangible net worth in excess of $150 million. In addition, the aggregate original issue price of
all of a particular issuer's stock index or currency warrant offerings (combined with offerings by its affiliates)
that are listed on a national securities exchange or on NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net
worth. The proposed amendment will also provide for automatic exercise of warrants upon expiration and that opening
prices will be used to determine the settlement value of an underlying index.

Exchange Rule 722 is being amended to apply the customer margin required for broad based index and currency options
to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants will require
payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require an initial margin of 100 percent of the current
value of the warrant plus 15 percent of the current value of the underlying index, less the amount by which the warrant
is out of the money, up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency warrants similarly will
follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that its index and currency
warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions.






Exchange Option Rules 1024, 1025, and 1070 concerning opening of accounts, supervision of accounts, and customer
complaints will all be made applicable to index and currency warrants. Presently, Exchange Rule 1026 and 1027 respecting
suitability and discretionary accounts for option transactions already are applicable to index and currency warrants.

Rule 1049 respecting written customer communications about listed options will apply to index and currency warrants
and require approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales literature and educational
material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. The Rule further requires
Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock index and currency warrants.

Rule 1001 is being amended to provide that index warrants on the same index with original issuer prices of ten dollars
or less will be 15 million warrants covering all such warrant issues and that warrant issues with an original issue
price over ten dollars will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or less.
Rule 1002 is being amended to provide that the exercise limits for index warrants will be analogous to those found in
stock index options and that such limits are separate and distinct from any exercise limits imposed by the issuer of
such warrants.

Rule 1047A regarding trading halts in index options is being amended to indicate that it also will apply to the trading
of index and currency warrants.

Rule 1000 will be amended to include applicable definitions of ``stock index group,'' ``stock index warrant,'' ``currency
warrant,'' ``currency index group'' and ``currency index warrant.''

Upon Commission approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes that it will only file rule changes for
specific warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying index already listed
on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option or warrant overlies a particular broad
based index, the Exchange proposes that it be allowed to list warrants on that index without further Commission review
and approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.

Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities
in the underlying index, by weight, may be compromised of foreign securities or American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')
overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the
Phlx and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.
 Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing
guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling
transactions in index or currency warrants.





The Phlx believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives
of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices
and to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between
customers, issuers, brokers and dealers.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-49
and should be submitted by January 10, 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, Inc. To Adopt a Monthly Examinations Fee</DOCTITLE>



December 12, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 2,1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b-4 of the Act, proposes to adopt an examinations fee applicable to Phlx member and
participant organizations for which the Exchange is the Designated Examining Authority (``DEA''), effective January
1, 1995. The following Phlx member/participant organizations would be exempt from the examinations fee: (1) Inactive
organizations; (2) organizations that operate from the Exchange's trading floors; (3) organizations for any month
where they incur transaction or clearing fees charged directly to them by the Exchange or by its registered clearing
subsidiary, provided that the fees exceed the examinations fee for that month;
 and (4) organizations affiliated with an organization exempt from this fee due to the second or third category.







Affiliation includes an organization that is a wholly owned subsidiary of, as well as an organization controlled
by or under common control with, an ``exempt'' member or participant organization. An inactive organization is one
which had no securities-related transaction revenue, as determined by semi-annual FOCUS reports, as long as the
organization continues to have no revenue each month.
 In order to compensate for the extensive staff time and costs associated with examining off-floor firms who are not
active participants in Phlx markets, the Exchange is proposing to amend its fee schedule by adopting a $1,000 per month
examination fee.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization
has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




1. Purpose



Commission Rule 15b2-2(b) requires that broker-dealers designated to a self-regulatory organization (``SRO'')
be examined for compliance with applicable financial responsibility rules within six months of registration with
the Commission. In addition, the examining SRO must conduct an examination within 12 months of Commission registration
to review compliance with all other Commission rules. Thereafter, examinations are conducted on a periodic basis.
In accordance with Commission rules, the Phlx administers an examinations program conducting reviews of organizations
for which the Exchange is the DEA. The examinations focus on an organization's compliance with applicable financial
and record keeping requirements, including net capital, books and record maintenance, Regulation T and financial
reporting, of the Phlx as well as the Commission.

<TEXT>
 

The Examinations Department incurs certain costs in the course of conducting these examinations, including travel
and staff costs. Of course, such costs rise when the offices of the organization being reviewed are located outside
of the Philadelphia area. Staff time required to conduct an examination is substantially longer when the businesses
of the firm are atypical of those firms for which the Phlx has historically served as DEA. Because of the familiarity
that inherently results from repeatedly conducting similar examinations, Phlx Examinations staff has accumulated
substantial experience regarding where to focus and locate information revealing potential areas of concern.
However, the Exchange is currently the DEA for approximately one dozen firms that engage in Phlx-atypical businesses
from remote locations. The Phlx is the DEA for firms located in other geographic regions, which do not transact business
on the Exchange, and trade products not available on the Phlx. For instance, a Chicago-based firm conducting proprietary
trades in government securities and a Connecticut-based firm engaged in convertible debt securities arbitrage
are examples of atypical Phlx firms. The heightened costs, which include both money as well as valuable staff time,
may be due to an atypically lengthy examination, travel and specific training regarding non-Phlx trading instruments.
In addition to actual costs incurred in conducting required examinations, the Exchange notes that, as the DEA for
a firm, the Phlx, similar to other SROs, also frequently performs an advisory role respecting the regulatory obligations
of its member/participant firms. This ``service'' function may take the form of answering telephone calls and other
questions of such firms regarding Exchange and Commission rules, as well as the types of procedures such firm should
have in place. Initially, becoming a member/participant firm of the Phlx, the Exchange assists in the firm's set-up
of its financials and communicates with the firm, providing sample forms and general guidance. Thereafter, a firm
may require periodic follow-up advice. These advisory costs to the Exchange of serving as the DEA are greater for the
Phlx-atypical firms.
However, these heightened costs may be offset by transaction charges and related revenues received by the Exchange
if such firms trade in Phlx markets. In reviewing these costs, the Exchange notes that Phlx member/participant organizations
may be required to pay various fees and transaction charges, which usually constitute a large part of the revenue collected
by the Exchange. Organization not trading on the Phlx escape these fees, while the Exchange remains obligated to administer
various regulatory functions, including costlier examinations. In the area of examinations, the factor of staff
time is particularly pronounced.
In some cases, these firms do not engage in business on the Phlx, and, consequently, the heightened costs are not offset
by revenues derived from these firms. Without this income source, the Exchange has determined to adopt an examinations
fee in order to alleviate certain costs of conducting examinations. Currently, the Phlx does not charge an examinations
or DEA fee, noting, in contrast, that most other SROs in the U.S. impose direct examinations fees.
 For the above reasons, therefore, the Phlx is proposing such a fee for those organizations for which it serves as DEA_with
certain exceptions. The proposed examinations fee would apply primarily to those member and participant organizations
which do not execute trades on the Phlx.




In order to fairly allocate the proposed examinations fee, the Exchange has determined to exempt those member and
participant organizations that actively trade on the Exchange, thereby counterbalancing examination costs with
transaction fees. Organizations that for any month incur transaction or clearing fees charged directly to them by
the Exchange or by its registered clearing subsidiary would be exempt from the fee, provided that the fees exceed the
examinations fee for that month. Inactive organizations would be exempt because examinations are not customarily
conducted for such organizations. Compliance with the inactive status will be determined by gross securities-related
transaction revenues reported on the organization's most recent semi-annual FOCUS report. In addition, the organization
must continue to lack such revenues, as determined monthly, in order to be exempt from the examinations fee.
Similarly, a member or participant organization that is wholly owned by, controlled by, or under common control with
an organization operating from the Phlx trading floor or generating counterbalancing Phlx transaction or clearing
fees would be exempt from this fee, because the affiliated organization is generating transaction or clearing fees
to help offset examinations costs.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(4),
in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its members and issuers
and other persons using its facilities. The Exchange believes that the proposed examinations fee of $1,000 per month
is reasonable in view of the Exchange's costs in conducting examinations of non-Phlx-trading organizations, especially
in terms of staff time.
The Exchange also believes that structuring the fee to exempt organizations that transact business on the Exchange
represents an equitable allocation of the Exchange's examination costs among members by focusing on those member
organizations that generally do not otherwise continually contribute to compensating for, and usually, in fact,
increase Exchange examination costs. The Exchange notes that the fee becomes effective January 1, 1995.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore
has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-66

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Holiday Expiration Date for Cash/Spot Foreign Currency
Options</DOCTITLE>


December 13, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 7, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1000, ``Applicability, Definitions, and References,'' to provide that the expiration
date for cash/spot foreign currency options (``3D options'') that expire on a holiday or an Exchange designated bank
holiday will be the business day following the holiday or the Exchange designated bank holiday. In addition, the PHLX
proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1000(b)(14) to correct the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' as it applies
to 3D options. Under the proposal, the 3D option contract listed on December 19, 1994, will be effected by the proposed
expiration procedure, but the 3D contract expiring on Friday, December 23, 1994, will not be effected by the proposed
expiration procedure.





The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.


II Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The PHLX proposes to amend its rules to make two changes to its 3D options. Presently, 3D options expire every Monday
at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. PHLX Rule 1000(b)(21)(iii), ``Expiration Date,'' provides that if Monday is
a holiday or Exchange designated bank holiday, 3D options will expire on the preceding business day. The Exchange
also trades physically settled foreign currency options that expire on the Friday preceding the third Wednesday
of each month (``mid-month options'') and on the last Friday of each month (``month-end options''). the PHLX states
that the Exchange created 3D options with a Monday expiration to attract users seeking an option capturing the risk
associated with the weekend.
Pursuant to existing PHLX Rule 1000(b)(21)(iii), if Monday is a holiday, the expiration reverts back to the preceding
business day, which is usually Friday but on some occasions may be Thursday. The Exchange now realizes that this defeats
the purpose of using 3D options to capture weekend risk. In response to this concern, which has been raised by users
of the product, the Exchange proposes that 3D options expire on the following business day, instead of the previous
business day, when the regular Monday expiration occurs on an Exchange holiday or designated bank holiday. This usually
will be a Tuesday, however, it may be a Wednesday. For example, Monday, December 26, 1994, is an Exchange holiday, (Christmas)
so expiration, as proposed, should be Tuesday. However, Tuesday, December 27, 1994, is a designated bank holiday
(Boxing Day), so expiration would occur on Wednesday, December 28, 1994, if the proposed ``next business date'' rule
were in effect.
In addition, the PHLX proposes to revise the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' to reflect that for 3D
options which are cash settled, the underlying foreign currency is the currency that the Options Clearing Corporation
(``OCC'') would have been obligated to sell or purchase upon exercise of the contract since OCC actually transfers
the cash value upon exercise of the foreign currency.

<DOCNO> FR941220-2-00057 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941220-2-00036 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular
with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors
and the public interest by providing both a more appropriate expiration date for 3D options when the expiration date
falls on a holiday.





(b) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition






The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.





(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others





No written comments were either solicited or received.





III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action





The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act of the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5).
 The PHLX state that the Exchange created 3D options with a Monday expiration in order to attract investors seeking
an option that captures weekend risk. Under current rules, however, if Monday is a holiday or designated bank holiday,
the 3D options will expire on the preceding business day, which is usually the preceding Friday. By amending its rules
to provide that 3D options will expire on the following business day when the regular expiration Monday is an Exchange
holiday or designated bank holiday, the Commission believes that the proposal will accommodate the investment objectives
of market participants and facilitate transactions in 3D options by providing investors with a means to capture weekend
currency risk.







The Commission believes that 3D options, as amended, should provide investors with greater flexibility to tailor
foreign currency options positions to satisfy their investment objectives. In this regard, the Commission notes
that the PHLX has stated that foreign currency options provide a strategic investment tool for sophisticated retail
options customers, multi-national corporations, and proprietary traders who manage and hedge foreign currency
exposure, as well as banks, which trade short-term FCOs to hedge the risks of trading in the foreign currency forward
and cash markets.
 In addition, the Commission continues to believe that 3D options broaden the hedging opportunities of foreign currency
market participants by providing them with an alternative to using futures contracts, forward contracts and/or
off-exchange customized derivative instruments to satisfy their short-term currency investment needs.





The Commission believes that the proposal to revise the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' clarifies
the definition in the context of 3D options by reflecting the fact that the OCC delivers the cash value, rather than
the underlying currency, upon exercises of a 3D option.


The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to allow the Exchange to implement the new holiday expiration procedure prior to the January 2, 1995, expiration,
an Exchange holiday. The Commission believes that the proposal to amend the holiday expiration procedure for 3D options
will allow investors to continue to use 3D options for the purpose of hedging weekend currency risk. In addition, the
Commission notes that the PHLX has notified its members of the proposed change and that the Commission has received
no comments on the proposal. The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to grant accelerated approval to
the proposal to revise the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' because the proposal clarifies the Exchange's
rule without making any substantive change. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections
6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.






IV. Solicitation of Comments




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by January 10, 1995.





It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PHLX-94-54) is hereby approved.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change
by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of Stock Index and Currency Warrants</DOCTITLE>




December 12, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on September 12, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Amex proposes to: (1) Amend Section 106 of the Amex Company Guide to revise the listing criteria for stock index
(``stock index'' or ``index'') warrants and currency warrants (``currency warrants'');
 (2) amend Rule 462 to specify the customer margin requirements for the purchase or short sale of stock index and currency
warrants; (3) add a new Part VI to the rules of the Exchange to provide rules for the trading of index and currency warrants;
and (4) rescind Commentaries .01 and .02 to Rule 411 (Duty to Know and Approve Customers) upon the adoption of new Part
VI of the Exchange's rules. On Dec. 2, 1994, the Amex amended certain surveillance related matters addressed in the
filing. See footnote 5 

infra.







The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex and at the Commission.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.




A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Amex proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines and establish uniform rules for the trading of stock index and
currency warrants; and (2) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency
warrants. 
The Amex seeks to amend Section 106 of the Amex Company Guide to provide higher standards for index and currency warrant
issuers than currently exists. In particular, such issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth
in excess of $150 million. In addition, the aggregate original issuer price of all of a particular issuer's warrant
offerings (combined with offerings by its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are
National Market securities traded through NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The
proposed amendment requires that each warrant issuer will be automatically exercised on either the delisting date
(if the issue is not listed upon another organized securities market) or upon expiration. Section 106 also will be
amended to provide that opening prices (``a.m. settlement'') for all U.S. traded securities will be used to determine
an index's settlement value where 25 percent or more of the value of the index is represented by securities whose primary
trading market is in the U.S.

Rule 462 is being amended to apply the current customer margin requirements for broad based stock index and currency
options to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants
will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent
of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less
the amount by which the warrant is out of the money, up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency
warrants will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that
its stock index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and
covered positions.






Proposed Part VI of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Rule
1100 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific rule in part VI applies, the provisions of
the Constitution and all other rules and policies of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities.

Proposed Rule 1101 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for the purchase
or sale of index or currency warrants unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading pursuant
to Exchange Rule 921. Accordingly, the Exchange will rescind Commentaries .01 and .02 to Rule 411, its current suitability
standard applicable to warrants, which currently provide that the Exchange ``recommends'' that index and currency
warrants only be sold to investors whose accounts have been approved for options trading. Furthermore, proposed
Rules 1102-1105 require that the option rules pertaining to suitability, discretionary account trading,
supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock index an currency warrants.

Proposed Rule 1106 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales
literature and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants.
The rule further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock
index and currency warrants.

Proposed Rule 1107 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original issue prices
of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. In addition, with respect to warrants
on the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Index, the position limit will be seven and one-half million warrants covering
all such issues, provided the original issue prices of the warrants are not grater than ten dollars. The rule provides
that warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or more will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an
original issue price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule also gives the Exchange the authority
to require the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits set forth in
the rule, and Commentary V to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position limits.

Proposed Rule 1108 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock index options
and states that such limits are distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by the issuers of stock index warrants.

Proposed Rule 1109 requires that the trading halt provisions in Rule 918C(b) shall be applied to the trading stock
index warrants.

Upon Commission approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes that it will only file rule changes for
specific warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying index already listed
on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option overlies a particular broad based
index, the Exchange proposes it be allowed to list warrants on that index without further Commission review and approval
pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.

Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities
in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American depositary receipts (``ADRs'')
overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the
Amex and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.
 Furthermore, proposed Rule 1100 provides that stock index and currency warrants listed on the Exchange prior to SEC
approval of this filing shall continue to be governed by those provisions of the Exchange's rules that were applicable
to such warrants prior to approval of this filing. Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange
will distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities
(including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in index or currency warrants.





2. Statutory Basis



The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and
practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary. Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-38
and should be submitted by January 10, 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Changes by the American Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated, Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated, Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board, National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Pacific Stock Exchange
Incorporated, and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to a Continuing Education Requirement for Registered
Persons</DOCTITLE>



December 15, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on November 30 and December 1, 5, 7, 12, 13, and 14, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated
(``CHX''), the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated (``CBOE''), the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''),
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'')
and the Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporated (``PSE''), the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``AMEX''), and the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX''), respectively, (each individually referred to herein as a ``Self-Regulatory Organization''
or ``SRO,'' and two or more collectively referred to as ``Self-Regulatory Organizations'' or ``SROs'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule changes as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the SROs. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes



The SROs propose to amend their rules to establish a formal, two-part continuing education program for securities
industry professionals that includes a Regulatory Element requiring uniform, periodic training in regulatory
matters, and a Firm Element requiring members
 to maintain ongoing programs to keep their registered persons
 up-to-date on job and product related subjects.






II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes



In their filings with the Commission, the SROs included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule changes and discussed any comments they received on the proposed rule changes. The text of these statements may
be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The SROs have prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.





(A) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes



1. Purpose



The purpose of the proposed rule changes is to adopt uniform enabling rules for the implementation of a continuing
education program for the securities industry.



2. Description of the Proposal



a. 

Background.

 In May 1993, a self-regulatory organization task force (``Task Force'') was formed by the AMEX, CBOE, MSRB, NASD,
NYSE, and PHLX, which included 12 representatives from a wide range of broker-dealers, to study the continuing education
needs of the securities industry. In September 1993, the Task Force issued a report recommending a formal two-part
continuing education program that would require uniform, industry-wide, periodic training in regulatory matters
and ongoing training programs conducted by firms to keep their employees updated on job and product-related subjects.
The Task Force also recommended that a permanent Council on Continuing Education, composed of broker-dealer and
SRO representatives, be formed to develop the content and provide ongoing maintenance of the continuing education
program. Pursuant to this recommendation, the Securities Industry/Regulatory Council on Continuing Education
(``Council'') was formed in September 1993, with representatives from six SROs and 13 broker-dealers. The Council
prepared draft rules to implement the continuing education program, which the SROs have filed as proposed rule changes
with the Commission.






The proposed rule changes would codify the Task Force's recommendations, enable uniform implementation of the continuing
education program, and provide a means for the SROs to monitor and enforce the program's requirements. The proposal
provides for a two-part continuing education program consisting of a Regulatory Element requiring uniform, periodic
training in regulatory matters and a Form Element requiring firms to maintain ongoing programs to keep their employees
up-to-date on job and product related subjects.

b. 

The Regulatory Element.

 Satisfaction of the Regulatory Element would require all registered persons (unless exempt) to complete a prescribed
training program after their second, fifth, and tenth registration anniversary dates.
 The Regulatory Element would be administered using computer-based interactive training techniques and would consist
of standardized subject matters covering generally compliance, ethics, and sales practice issues. Failure to complete
the program within prescribed time-frames (

i.e.,

 within 120 days after the occurrence of the applicable registration anniversary date, or as otherwise determined
by the SROs) would result in a person's registration being deemed inactive and that person being prohibited from performing
the functions of a registered person until such time as the person has completed the program. The SRO will terminate
administratively the registration of anyone who is inactive for two years, provided that upon application and a showing
of good cause, the SRO may allow a registered person additional time to satisfy the program requirements.







Persons registered for more than 10 years as of the effective date of the rule would not have to satisfy the Regulatory
Element requirements. Persons registered for 10 years or less as of the effective date of the rule would be required
to satisfy the Regulatory Element and complete the computer-based training program after the occurrence of the next
relevant registration anniversary date and on any applicable registration anniversary date(s) thereafter.

A registered person who has completed all or part of the regulatory Element of the program or otherwise is exempt from
participation therein would have to reenter the Regulatory Element in the event he or she is subject to certain disciplinary
actions. Such individual would have to complete the computer-based training program within 120 days of such reentry
and at two, five and 10 years thereafter. The following disciplinary events would trigger such reentry:

<PARENT> FR941220-2-00037 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A. Being subject to a statutory disqualification as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act;





B. Being ordered to reenter the Regulatory Element by the Commission, an SRO, or state securities regulatory agency
as a sanction in a disciplinary action; or

C. Being subject to suspension or imposition of a fine of $5,000 or more for the violation of any securities law or regulation,
or agreement with, or rule or standard of conduct of, any SRO or securities regulatory agency, or as imposed by any such
SRO or regulatory agency in connection with a disciplinary proceeding.

c. 

The Firm Element.

 Satisfaction of the Firm Element of the program would require SRO members to develop and administer training programs
to enhance the securities knowledge, skills, and professionalism of their registered sales, trading, and investment
banking personnel who have direct contact with customers, and for the immediate supervisors of such persons. Members
would be required to prepare training plans taking into consideration the organization's size, organizational
structure, and scope of business activities, as well as regulatory developments and the performance of covered persons
in the Regulatory Element. At a minimum, programs used to implement a member's training plan must be appropriate for
the business of the members and must cover the following matters concerning securities products, services, and strategies
offered by the member: General investment features and associated risk factors; suitability and sales practice
considerations; and applicable regulatory requirements.

Members would be required to review and, if necessary, update their training plans annually. The SROs may require
their members, either individually or as part of a group, to provide specific training in any areas the SROs deem necessary.
Persons subject to the training plan would have an affirmative obligation to participate in the programs identified
by the member. Finally, members would be required to maintain records documenting the content of their training programs
and the completion of the program by registered persons covered under the plan.

d. 

Effective Date.

 The SROs intend that the requirements of the Regulatory Element portion of the continuing education program become
effective on July 1, 1995, and that the Firm Element be implement in two steps whereby members would be required to have
completed their Firm Element plans by July 1, 1995, and have implemented their plans no later than January 1, 1996.

3. Statutory Basis



The SROs believe that their respective proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges, national securities associations,
and the MSRB and, in particular, the respective requirements of Sections 6(b)(5), 15A(b)(6), and 15B(b)(2)(C) of
the Act.
 Sections 6(b)(5), 15A(b)(6), and 15B(b)(2)(C) require, among other things, that the rules of an exchange, and association,
or the MSRB, respectively, be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors
and the public interest. The SROs further believe that their proposed rule changes also are consistent with the respective
provisions of Sections 6(c)(3)(B), 15A(g)(3)(A), and 15B(b)(2)(A) of the Act,
 each of which makes it the responsibility of an exchange, an association, or the MSRB to prescribe standards of training,
experience and competence for persons associated with SRO members.







(B) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition


The SROs do not believe that the proposed rule changes would result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received From Members, Participants,
or Others 



1. Comments Received by the NASD



On August 15, 1994, the NASD published Special Notice to Members (``NTM'') 94-59 to request member comment regarding
the Council's draft rules to create a mandated continuing education program for the securities industry. Thirty-three
comment letters were received in response. Twenty-six letters were from financial services firms, four from trade
associations, two from firms active in the continuing education field, and one was from the NASD's District 1. Five
of the letters were opposed to the NASD's proposal, while the remaining letters either expressed support for, or were
not opposed to, the proposal. As discussed below, the proposed rules that the SROs have filed with the Commission have
been revised from the Council's original draft rules to address some of the commenters' concerns.

Three letters from financial services firms question the usefulness of the Regulatory Element. The first, from a
firm that limits its business primarily to wholesaling mutual funds, stated that the Regulatory Element creates
more problems than it solves, costs too much, and would have the effect of fostering a negative attitude towards regulation.
The second letter requests that the Regulatory Element be tailored to the specific products and services provided
by each member. The third letter questions the use of the disciplinary fine threshold with respect to the re-entry
provision, and believes the 10 year grandfather provision should be shortened in some cases. The writer concludes
that the securities industry should model its program after state insurance continuing education programs, where
the licensing authority imposes the regulatory requirement directly on the individual, rather than on the firm.
Three letters from financial services firms express concern that the Regulatory Element of the program would be administered
at testing centers operated by the NASD. The request that firms be allowed to administer the Regulatory Element in-house,
subject to appropriate controls.
Three letters support the goals of the Regulatory Element, but raise concerns about its specific focus. One letter
suggests that the Regulatory Element be divided into two separate units, one for commissioned brokers and one for
registered persons operating in a no-load environment. One letter suggests that this part be divided based on the
registration category of the individual and the membership of the individual's firm. The third commenter believes
that the Regulatory Element should relate to the daily activities of the largest number of registered persons possible.

Three letters address concerns regarding the statistics that would be generated from the Regulatory Element. All
three letters seek specific information on the types of statistics that would be available. Two of the letters express
concern that the NASD has not enuniated clearly the intended and acceptable uses of these statistics.

Two letters from financial services firms seek a clearer definition of ``inactive status'' as used in the Regulatory
Element. The letters have questions regarding the disposition of monies earned, but not paid, prior to inactive status,
and the allowable level of interaction between an individual on inactive status and his or her member firm. One writer
asks whether inactive status should be treated as a disciplinary event, while the other writer believes that the rules
should state clearly that inactive status is in no way a disciplinary event.

Four commenters address the re-entry provisions of the Regulatory Element. These concerns range from technical
wording of the re-entry provision, to stating that the fine threshold is unfair with respect to technical violations
and ambiguous in cases where several individuals are held jointly and severally liable, to stating that the provision
regarding disciplinary actions is overly harsh. One commenter believes that the provision allowing the SEC, SROs,
and state regulators to require a registered person to re-enter the Regulatory Element should be deleted, or at least
changed to require a showing of cause.

Another commenter believes that Central Registration Depository (``CRD'')

10

 support would help firms comply with the Regulatory Element. Specifically, CRD could be used by firms to identify
registered persons and their length of service to determine how many of their registered persons would be subject
to the Regulatory Element in each of the next few years. 





One letter offers broad insights and recommendations for a continuing education program, but does not contain specific
reactions to the proposal. 

Four letters were received from financial services firms that expressed concerns regarding the costs of complying
with the Firm Element. Generally, these firms state that the Firm Element could have a disproportionately burdensome
effect on smaller firms, as compared to larger ones. To mitigate these effects, the commenters suggest that the NASD
prepare and administer training programs, or, alternatively, that subsidies be provided to smaller firms to help
them comply with the Firm Element. Another commenter recommends a video via satellite program that would enable firms
to secure qualified speakers, and be assured that the material provided would comply with the Firm Element. 

Two letters regarding the Firm Element have questions about those to whom it would apply. The first letter asks whether
municipal securities brokers fall under the definition of ``covered persons'' for this part of the program. The second
asks whether the Firm Element applies to sales assistants who are registered persons, or whether an accommodation
for such persons could be made. 

Five letters comment on the standards for the Firm Element. The first commenter asks how and what information should
be maintained regarding the program and offers suggestions. The second commenter believes that the Firm Element
should focus on suitability, and favors some form of pre-approval regarding the contents of a firm's program. The
third commenter asks whether a firm may include relevant compliance matters in the Firm Element so that it may meet
its ``annual compliance interview/meeting'' requirement under the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. The fourth commenter
believes that the Firm Element content requirements are too vague to ensure proper compliance. The fifth commenter
questions the usefulness of feedback from the Regulatory Element in developing an appropriate Firm Element. 

Two financial services firms comment on the provision allowing the NASD to require members to undertake specific
training. The first letter seeks a definition of the phrase ``class of covered registered person,'' stating that
such a class should be clearly identifiable by firms. The second letter states that to grant the NASD discretion to
mandate specific training for certain individuals or groups could have potentially arbitrary results that could
place certain firms at a competitive disadvantage. 

Four industry associations submitted letters in response to the proposal. Two associations, the Securities Industry
Association (``SIA'') and the Security Traders Association (``STA''), are comprised almost entirely of people
potentially affected by the proposal. The other two, The Association for Investment Management and Research ``AIMR'')
and the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards (``CFP''), are active in the continuing education field and
have many members who are potentially affected people. 

The STA strongly supports the proposal, and expresses its desire to help implement the program. The SIA also supports
the program, but believes that several of its aspects merit further consideration. The SIA believes that the NASD
and the Council should develop standards to determine when registered persons may be required by regulators to re-enter
the Regulatory Element, and the power of the NASD arbitrarily to prescribe specific training for a member firm. The
SIA also supports in-house administration of the Regulatory Element, with appropriate controls. Lastly, the SIA
seeks clearer guidelines to determine the adequacy of a given Firm Element training program. 

Although the AIMR and the CFP each endorse the proposal, both are concerned about overlap for individuals who hold
their designations and are also subject to this proposal. Both groups desire to work with the Council to minimize the
impact caused by the overlap between the proposed rules and the existing requirements of the AIMR and CFP on individuals
who would be subject to both regimes. 

Two parties that are active in the continuing education field responded to the proposal, the Securities Education
Institute, Inc. (``SEI''), and the American Institute for Continuing Education (``AICE''). Both focus on the differences
between the proposed program and programs that already exist in the insurance industry. Both seek more information
regarding the Firm Element so as to help NASD members and independent training providers meet the program requirements.
The SEI believes that administration of the Regulatory Element should not be limited to the NASD testing centers or
to those firms with the proper in-house delivery means. Instead, interactive programs similar to those the SEI provides
to the futures industry should be used (these would include safeguards already authorized by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission).

NASD District 1 supports the proposal and offers two suggestions. First, with respect to the Regulatory Element,
the commenter suggests that the sections relating to ``Requirements'' and ``Re-entry into Program'' be amended
to make it clear that the time frame of the Regulatory Element is 10 years, not 15. Regarding the Firm Element, the commenter
asks who the ``Specific Training'' provision would operate (

i.e., 

at what level of the NASD would such decisions be made). 

The comments submitted on NTM 94-59 were reviewed by the Council and by the NASD Membership Committee. Neither
the Council nor the Membership Committee agreed with those commenters who opposed instituting a continuing education
program for the securities industry, believing that it is in the best interest of the investing public and the industry
to proceed with the program. 

The Membership Committee made three technical changes to the rule as originally proposed in NTM 94-59. First,
the language in Section (1)(a)(i) of the NASD's proposal was redrafted to state clearly that registered persons must
participate in the Regulatory Element of the continuing education program on three occasions, after the occurrence
of their second, fifth, and tenth registration anniversary dates. Second, Section (1)(b) of the NASD's proposal
has been expanded to state that a registration that is inactive for a period of two calendar years would be terminated
administratively, and that a person whose reregistration is so terminated must requalify by taking the Series 7 examination
before such person's registration could be reactivated. Finally, Section (1)(c)(iii) of the NASD's proposal was
amended to clarify that the Commission, a state securities regulator, or an SRO could require re-entry into the program
only as a result of a sanction in a formal disciplinary action. This change is meant to address the concerns of those
commenting on the due process issues that could arise were regulatory authorities able to mandate re-entry arbitrarily.


The NASD Membership Committee did not respond to other recommendations made by commenters. The Committee believes
that it is unnecessary to state explicitly that inactive status under the Regulatory Element of the program is not
a disciplinary action. Explanatory materials on this point would accompany the notice to members announcing the
effectiveness of the rule. 

A number of commenters suggested that member firms be permitted to administer the Regulatory Element in-house. The
Council and the SROs will continue to study this issue and will formulate a final response for the industry in the future.
The program, however, initially would be implemented only in the NASD's testing centers. The Membership Committee
believes this to be necessary to allow the NASD to manage the introduction of the program in a reasonable manner. The
technology and administrative issues that arise with respect to the in-house administration of the Regulatory Element
will require further study to be resolved. 

Finally, some commenters questioned the use of a single computer-based training program in a Regulatory Element
for all persons within the first 10 years of their initial registration. The Membership Committee and the Council
recognized that there are variations in function and degree of involvement in the securities industry among the approximately
500,000 individuals registered as representatives. Both the Council and the NASD Membership Committee believe
that the initial computer-based training program should deal with the most important compliance and regulatory
concerns confronting the industry, and that these matters are important for all segments of the securities industry.
The Council, the Membership Committee, and the other SROs would continue to review the need for more specialized computer-based
training programs for different segments of the industry. In the future, these groups may recommend that such programs
be introduced, but only after further assessing the experience with the initial single computer-based training
program.

2. Comments Received by the MSRB



In August 1994, the MSRB published its proposal for comment, and subsequently received five comment letters.

One commenter stated that its dealer department is a two-person operation and the proposed Firm Element is an unreasonable
burden to be placed on such a small operation. The Firm Element Committee of the Council is developing materials for
dealers' use in devising and carrying out training programs to meet the requirements of the Firm Element. The Committee
intends to incorporate ``samples'' of how different firms might approach the requirements (

e.g.

, firms that deal with one product, small firms, and firms with large numbers of very small offices or solo representatives).
The MSRB believes this future guidance would assuage the concerns of small firms as to the burden of compliance with
this requirement.

One commenter, a municipal securities broker's broker, asked whether it would be subject to the Firm Element requirements.
The Firm Element is applicable to all persons who conduct business with retail, institutional, or investment banking
customers of the dealer and the immediate supervisors of such persons. The Firm Element is not applicable to dealers
who deal only with other brokers and dealers.

One commenter stated that the MSRB has not shown that a continuing education program is needed in the industry. Another
commenter expressed similar concerns. The Task Force formed by the securities industry to study the issue of continuing
education and to develop recommendations concluded that the industry would be will served by a uniform continuing
education program. The MSRB believes that a formal industry-wide continuing education program to keep professionals
up-to-date on products, markets, and rules would be beneficial to the municipal securities industry.

Another commenter sent the same comments to the MSRB and the NASD. These comments have been summarized above.

The MSRB also received two telephone inquiries from bank dealers concerning the planned procedure for the CRD system
to track and communicate an individual's registration anniversary date for use with the Regulatory Element. Bank
dealer personnel are not registered on the CRD system. The MSRB has discussed this notification matter on an informal
basis with the bank regulatory agencies. Such agencies have stated that they would probably require banks to put procedures
into place for internal tracking of anniversary dates.



3. Comment Received by the NYSE



The NYSE received one letter from a member organization commenting on its proposal. The commenter endorsed the computer-based
training of the Regulatory Element, but recommended that such training be required upon an individual's initial
registration, in addition to the required three occasions thereafter (

i.e.

, after the second, fifth and tenth registration anniversary dates).

The NYSE believes that the continuing education program has been designed to apply to registered persons after they
have satisfied the initial qualification requirements and that two years after a person's initial registration
and qualification is an appropriate time to reinforce significant general regulatory and sales practice concepts
and provide training on recent rule and other current developments through the continuing education process.



4. Comments Received by Other SROs



The other SROS have not solicited, and do not intend to solicit, comments regarding the proposed rule change. They
also have not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties. All of the SROs
have made, or intend to make, changes to their proposals to conform to changes made by the other SROs in response to comments
they received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Changes and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organizations consent,
the Commission will:

A. By order approve such proposed rule changes, or

B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule changes should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule changes that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule changes between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal offices
of the Exchanges. All submissions should refer to the file number(s) in the caption above and should be submitted by
January 10, 1995. 



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Notice of intent.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
highway project in the Town of Southeast, Putnam County, New York.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), in cooperation with the Town of Southeast,
with input from the County of Putnam, will be preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve
New York State Route 22. The proposed improvement will involve the reconstruction of the existing route from the northern
terminus of Interstate 684 to Putnam County Route 65, Putnam Lake Road, a distance of 2.9 miles. Also under consideration
in this proposal is construction of a grade separated interchange at Putnam County Route 54, Milltown Road.



The project proposes to improve traffic operation and safety on the existing route. The proposed action is consistent
with the NYSDOT transportation improvement program for the Route 22 corridor, between Interstate Route 684 and Route
55, which has been studied by the FHWA and NYSDOT since 1980. In 1990, the Route 22 Corridor Development Study_Final
Project Development Report was completed. the Corridor Development Study identified existing traffic operation
and safety problems, projected significant future increases in traffic demand, identified needed highway improvements
and recommended in implementation plan. Improvement of Route 22 between Interstate Route 684 and County Route 65,
Putnam Lake Road, was recommended, as were other improvements within the corridor. 
Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action, (2) expanding the existing two-lane highway to four
lanes with a flush median and improved intersections; (3) expanding the existing two-lane highway to four lanes divided
by a median barrier and with turning lanes at intersections; and (4) congestion management system strategies. Variations
to horizonal and vertical alignment and the possible provision of an interchange at Milltown Road will also be studied
with the various build alternatives. 
Based on studies done to date, issues that need to be analyzed in depth include the impacts on noise, air and water quality,
cultural resources, floodplains, and adjacent right of way. The project's effect on features such as Bog Brook Reservoir
and East Branch will also be addressed. 
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed interest in this proposal. If
necessary, a scoping meeting will be held with involved Federal, State and local agencies. A public information meeting
will be held after additional study. The EIS will be made available for agency and public review and comment, after
which a public hearing will be held. 
To ensure that the full range of issues related to the proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or NYSDOT at the addresses provided above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship Program was authorized by section 6001 of the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Public Law 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914. The program is expected
to enhance the educational level of the transportation work force in the United States. The program will contribute
to the talent pool in transportation because it encourages students from their senior year through the post doctorate
level to pursue careers in fields related to transportation. 



The Eisenhower Program is a DOT-wide fellowship program and is managed by the National Highway Institute. The program
was developed in the Summer of 1992. The first fellowships were awarded in the Spring of 1993. FY 1994 funding for the
program was $2 million and served 125 fellows; FY 1995 funding for the program is also $2 million. 

All fellows must be in a field of study which is directly related to transportation. For students pursuing degrees,
the fellow's degree program must contain a major, minor, or emphasis in transportation. In addition, each fellowship
has specific requirements unique to that fellowship. 

The six fellowships are: 

Eisenhower Graduate Fellowships, to enable students to pursue Masters Degrees or Doctorates in transportation-related
fields at the school of their choice; 

Eisenhower Grants for Research Fellowships (GRF), to acquaint students with transportation research, development,
and technology transfer activities at the U.S. Department of Transportation; 

Eisenhower Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Fellowships, to provide HBCU students with additional
opportunities to enter careers in transportation (announcements are issued by recipient HBCU's); 

Eisenhower Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) Fellowships, to provide HSI students with additional opportunities
to enter careers in transportation; (announcements are issued by recipient HSIs); 

Eisenhower Post Doctorate Fellowships, to enable GRF students to continue research initiated during a GRF assignment;
and 

Eisenhower Faculty Fellowships, to provide talented faculty in transportation fields with opportunities to improve
their transportation knowledge, including attendance at conferences, courses, seminars, and workshops. 

Applications must be submitted by February 17, 1995, and will be evaluated by review panels. All applicants will be

Chrysler Corporation; Grant of Application for Renewal of Temporary Exemption From Three Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards 



Chrysler Corporation of Highland Park, Michigan, applied for a renewal of NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 92-1,
expiring August 31, 1994 (57 FR 27507) which was granted covering three Federal motor vehicle safety standards, for
electric-powered multipurpose passenger vehicles (``TEVan''). As of June 10, 1994, the company had produced 52
TEVans under the exemption. Its application for renewal was accompanied by a copy of its original petition, and NHTSA
interpreted this action as an indication that the company intended to repeat its original requests and arguments.


Notice of the application was published on August 3, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 39631). This
notice grants a renewal of the exemption. 

The TEVan is an electrically driven version of the Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager multipurpose passenger vehicle.
If the exemption is renewed, modifications will be made to production Dodge and Plymouth vans manufactured between
September 1, 1994 and August 31, 1996. Although a successor to the current van will be introduced within this time frame,
``electric conversions of that new platform will not be ready for production initially'' and Chrysler is planning
``to produce the current TEVan versions until the new electric conversion units are ready for introduction.'' The
TEVan was developed in cooperation with the Electric Power Research Institute, U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium,
and the United States Department of Energy. The basis for the petition was that a temporary exemption would facilitate
the development and field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle within the meaning of 49 CFR 555.6(c). The vehicles
use electric motors powered by nickel-iron or other equivalent batteries that replace the internal combustion engine.
According to Chrysler, the TEVans meet the California Air Resource Board zero emission requirements, and are low-emission
vehicles as defined by section 123(g) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (now 49 U.S.C. 30113(a)).


The TEVan differs from regular production vans as follows: The internal combustion engine, transmission, coolant
system, power brakes, gasoline fuel system, and power steering system have been replaced by an electric drive motor,
a nickel-iron or equivalent battery pack, a micro-processor based battery management system, a controller-converter-charger
unit, a two-speed manual/automatic transmission, and electric-motor-driven pumps for the vacuum power brakes
and the hydraulically assisted power steering. Finally, the hot water heater/defroster unit is replaced by an electric
resistance type heating/defrosting system.

<TEXT>
 

The TEVan is based on production vehicles certified as complying with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. However, it does not comply with the portions of the standards indicated below. 
1. Standard No. 101, 

Controls and Displays. 
S5.1. The TEVan is equipped with a state-of-charge gauge to serve as an indicator of reserve battery power, rather
than the fuel gauge required by the standard. 
2. Standard No. 102, Transmission Shift Lever Sequence, Starter Interlock, and Transmission Braking Effect. 
S3.1.2. The requirement for transmission braking effect is met by regenerative braking, in which the electric motor
becomes a generator, recharging the batteries and dissipating energy in the process. Regenerative braking can be
switched off at the option of the driver to restore steering control on slippery surfaces. 
S3.1.3. The starter interlock mechanism is deleted since there will be no electric starting motor. 
S3.1.4. The automatic transmission shift mechanism is replaced with an electric switch control device that operates
in a similar manner. 
3. Standard No. 105, Hydraulic Brake Systems 
S5.1. The performance of the service brake system is predicated on the use of the regenerative characteristic of the
drive motor to augment the power-assisted hydraulic wheel brakes. The motor, driven through the transmission by
the mass of the coasting vehicle, functions as a generator to dissipate energy through charging the drive batteries.
Chrysler has never conducted tests using regenerative braking, however, tests of a conventionally powered weighted
simulation of the TEVan indicate that the TEVan will meet the stopping distance requirements of S5.1.1. In the fade
and recovery test, S5.1.4, the distance specified between the starting points of successive brake applications
at 60 mph is 0.4 mile. The TEVan cannot accelerate to 60 mph in that distance, so the test cannot be conducted as prescribed,
but based on the performance of a simulated TEVan, the TEVan could comply if it could accelerate as specified. 
On TEVans equipped with anti-lock brake systems, the regenerative braking is disabled during hard stops that actuate
the anti-lock feature of the brakes. 
According to the original petition, an exemption would facilitate the development and field evaluation of a low-emission
motor vehicle by enabling the petitioner to develop the electric drive motor, battery controller, battery, and other
subsystems to increase the efficiency and durability of future generations of electric vehicles. 
The petitioner requested extension of its exemption for a two-year period beginning September 1, 1994. In its original
petition it argued that the exemptions will not unduly degrade the safety of the vehicles because the vehicles from
which the TEVan is adapted are certified as conforming to the standards. Chrysler observes in its petition for renewal
that its ``field experience to date would indicate no negative result if this extension was granted.'' 
Finally, petitioner originally argued that granting the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent
with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act because it would accelerate the development of electrically-driven
vehicles and related technology which could help to reduce the dependency on foreign oil. 
No comments were received on the petition. 
In order to grant the renewal of an exemption originally provided under 49 U.S.C. 30113(b)(3)((B)(iii) (formerly
15 U.S.C. 1410(a)(1)(C)), the Administrator must find that the temporary exemption would ``make the development
or field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle easier and would not unreasonably lower the safety level of that
vehicle,'' and that the exemption is consistent with the public interest and 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 Motor Vehicle Safety.


The applicant has argued that the exemption would enable it to continue to develop the components of the vehicle to
increase the efficiency and durability of future generations of electric vehicles. NHTSA concurs with this argument.
It is probable that an exemption would permit the use of the vehicles under varied conditions of climate and terrain,
testing those components for durability and life. 
Petitioner has also argued that safety is not compromised because the vehicles from which the TEVan is adapted are
certified as conforming to the standards. The inability of the TEVan to meet two of the standards from which exemption
is requested, Standards Nos. 101 and 102, appears only technical in nature, as systems and instruments are provided
that are the equivalents of those in gasoline-powered vehicles. As for Standard No. 105, the petitioner on the basis
of simulated tests of weighted vehicles, judges that the stopping distance requirements will be met. It is NHTSA's
experience that regenerative braking can provide a drag on the vehicle's forward motion when the foot is removed from
the accelerator; this, coupled with foot brake activation should ensure adequate stopping capability. 
It is manifestly in the public interest to accelerate the development of electrically-driven vehicles, not only
to reduce reliance on oil, no matter where it originates, but also to reduce the level of harmful emissions in the environment.
Because of the minimal impact on safety of the renewal of this exemption, NHTSA considers that an exemption is consistent
with the objectives of Chapter 301.

In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that renewal of NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 92-1 for
a further two years would make the development or field evaluation of a low-emission vehicle easier, and would not
unreasonably lower the safety level of that vehicle, and that renewal of this exemption would be in the public interest
and consistent with the objectives of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 

Motor Vehicle Safety.

 Accordingly, Chrysler Corporation is hereby granted a renewal of NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 92-1, beginning
September 1, 1994, and expiring August 31, 1996, from providing a fuel gauge as required by paragraph S5.1 of 49 CFR
571.101 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 101 

Controls and Displays,

<DOCTITLE>Ford Motor Company; Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE>



Ford Motor Company (Ford) of Dearborn, Michigan decided that some of its windows failed to comply with the labeling
requirements of 49 CFR 571.205, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 205, ``Glazing Materials,'' and
filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Ford also applied
to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on
the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.

Notice of receipt of the application was published on October 3, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59
FR 50329). This notice exempts Ford from the notification and remedy requirements of the statute.

Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code
for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z-26.1-1977, January
26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that typical automotive tempered glass with
a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent shall be labeled ``AS3.''

Ford manufactured approximately 1,820,000 quarter windows with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent
for use in 1986 through 1994 model year Ranger Supercab and Mazda B-series Cab Plus vehicles. These windows were labeled
``AS2'' instead of ``AS3.'' Approximately 7,900 were located and scrapped. The remaining windows were used in vehicle
production or provided to aftermarket distributors for service replacement.

Ford supported its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:






[Ford believes that t]he incorrect marking presents no risk of accident or injury. The windows can be installed only
as rear quarter windows in Ranger Supercab trucks; AS2 and AS3 glazing are both appropriate for these applications
in accordance with Standard 205. In Ford's judgement, the mismarking is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety. The stated purposes of FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure
a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility
of occupants being thrown through vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted the affected quarter windows
fully comply with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205. Because all performance requirements are met, the
incorrect marking of the quarter windows has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended
by the standard. Ford is not aware of any complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition.

The mismarking should not cause confusion in glass replacement in vehicles in service. Aftermarket distributors
do not use the marking to determine which glazing is used for replacement. Rather, replacement parts are determined
by service part numbers which are obtained from cataloged listings. Further, we are not aware of any confusion in aftermarket
servicing of vehicles as a result of this mismarking.






No comments were received on the petition.

NHTSA has considered these arguments and has found them persuasive. Because FMVSS No. 205 permits either AS2 or AS3
glazing to be used in the rear quarter location, the use of mislabeled glazing in those areas will have no safety impact.
The fact that the windows can be used only in that location and not in other locations where use of AS3 glazing would be
inappropriate confirms this conclusion.

Accordingly, for the reasons expressed above, the applicant has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance
herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety, and Ford Motor Company is hereby exempted from providing
notification and remedy with respect thereto.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974, as Amended; System of Records</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Internal Revenue Service, Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed amendment to Privacy Act system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, gives notice of a proposed amendment to the system of records
entitled Compliance Programs and Projects Files_Treasury/IRS 42.021, which is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974,
5 U.S.C. 552a.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Internal Revenue Service is redesigning business and work processes to improve the way we use technology to maximize
the availability of information resources. This will require long-term, continuous improvement to product quality,
productivity, and customer satisfaction.




One of the strategies to implement this change is Compliance 2000. This is a mission-based philosophy of tax administration
that emphasizes taxpayer education and assistance coupled with a more focused use of enforcement resources. Compliance
2000 will address making the tax system easier for taxpayers to comply voluntarily, yet recognizes that despite the
Service's best efforts some people will not voluntarily respond. One goal of Compliance 2000 is to identify and address
causes of noncompliance.

This system presently includes records relating to information gathering to identify noncompliance with the Internal
Revenue Code. Enhancements are being added to the system to enable the Internal Revenue Service to identify causes
of noncompliance. These enhancements will be accomplished by use of an automated information system to form an integrated,
on-line resource network. Instead of each function or level within a geographical area addressing isolated or systemic
compliance or business issues on its own (National, Regional, District, or Service Center), we will approach business
from a more unified perspective to provide one-stop information to compliance personnel within a local area and greatly
reduce the need for separate contracts with outside sources. Data will be drawn from the Audit Information Management
System (AIMS)_Treasury/IRS 42.008; the Individual Master File (IMF)_Treasury/IRS 24.030; the Business Master
File (BMF)_Treasury/IRS 24.046; the Returns Compliance Programs File_Treasury/IRS 26.016; the Taxpayer Delinquent
Accounts Files (TDA)_Treasury/IRS 26.019; Taxpayer Delinquency Investigation (TDI) Files_Treasury/IRS 26.020;
Wage and Information Returns Processing (IRP) System_Treasury/IRS 22.061; the International Enforcement Program
Files_Treasury/IRS 42.017; the Case Management and Time Reporting System_Treasury/IRS 46.002; and from the Centralized
Evaluation and Processing of Information Items_Treasury/IRS 46.009. In addition, data will be drawn from other
third party sources. As an example, these third party sources may include commercial sources, state and local agencies,
construction contract information, license information from state and local agencies, Currency and Banking Reports
(CBRS), data regarding assets and financial transactions from state and local agencies, and information on significant
financial transactions from reviews of periodicals and local newspapers, and other media sources.

The system of records notice is being amended to give a more definitive description of the records that are to be included
in the system. This notice will also reflect the change to consolidate this new information within each geographical
location and for on-line access to this information on a need-to-know basis. There will be additional authorized
users within each local area network.

Internal Revenue Service will develop and maintain database and retrieval systems accessed through automated local
area networks. The purpose of these systems will be to combine information from sources inside and outside the IRS,
such as motor vehicle data, business license data, currency and banking data (CBRS), commercial database information,
into a centralized processing unit which will serve as a comprehensive compliance network for each district, service
center, region, etc. These databases would be available for use by all IRS functions on a need-to-know basis. As an
example, a database may be configured to identify a particular grouping or market segment of taxpayers and their assets
in a more efficient and effective manner than is presently available. Previously this was not possible because of
the format and configuration of the original databases. For example, in addition to taxpayer data from the system
of records listed herein, this system may include on-line access to such information as the Currency and Banking Retrieval
System (CBRS), any state's Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV), Credit Bureau information, real estate ownership
information, and commercial databases.
