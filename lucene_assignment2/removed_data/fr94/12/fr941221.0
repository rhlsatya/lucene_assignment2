OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT








Pay Under The General Schedule; Within-Grade Increases


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing final regulations relating to the interim relief provisions authorized
under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. The final regulations provide that an interim within-grade increase
must be made effective on the date of the appellate decision ordering interim relief.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published final regulations on interim relief under the Whistleblower
Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) (5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)) in the 

Federal Register

 on January 31, 1992 (57 FR 3707). The requirements for interim within-grade increases in existence at that time in
5 CFR 531.414(b) provided that ``an interim within-grade increase granted under paragraph (a) of that section shall
become effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the date of the favorable within-grade
increase determination.''


However, the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) issued a decision on December 22, 1993 (

Andrew W. Harrell 

v. 

Department of the Army, 

AT-531D-93-0559-I-1), which stated that ``OPM's provision contradicts the express
language of 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A), which states that `the employee or applicant shall be granted the relief provided
in the decision 

effective upon the making of the decision' 

(emphasis added). Accordingly, we find that the agency has failed to provide evidence of complete relief, as ordered,
and dismiss the agency's petition for review.''
OPM's final regulation on the effective date of an interim within-grade increase was intended to carry out the purpose
of the statute without creating an undue administrative burden for agencies and to be consistent with longstanding
requirements governing the effective date of within-grade increases. OPM believed the regulation was consistent
with the spirit and purpose of the WPA. While we were not persuaded that this regulation was inconsistent with the spirit
and purpose of the WPA, we recognized that the interpretation reflected in MSPB's recent decision is a plausible reading
of the law. Further, we did not wish to create undue difficulty for agencies that are required to provide interim relief
under the WPA. Therefore, OPM issued interim regulations on May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24029), that modified the existing
regulations on interim within-grade increases to be consistent with MSPB's decision.


Comments on the Interim Regulations


We received one comment on the interim regulations from a Federal agency. The agency observed that, since the interim
regulations provide that an interim within-grade increase will become effective on the date of the appellate decision
ordering interim relief under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A) rather than the first day of the first pay period beginning on
or after the date of the favorable within-grade increase determination, it would be consistent for any final decision
by MSPB upholding the negative within-grade increase determination to become effective also on the date of the decision.
The agency suggests revising 5 CFR 531.414(c) to reflect such a change. We agree, and we are adopting this recommendation.


Conforming Change in Part 772


Because the effective date of an interim within-grade increase is being changed in these final regulations, a necessary
conforming change in 5 CFR 772.102(a) is needed. The reference to interim within-grade increases as an exception
to the general rule about when interim personnel actions are to be made effective is deleted.

Absence and Leave; SES Annual Leave Accumulation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing interim regulations governing annual leave accumulation for members
of the Senior Executive Service (SES). Under recent legislation, there is now a 90-day (720-hour) maximum limitation
on the amount of annual leave an SES member may carry over from one leave year to the next. Previously, SES members could
accumulate annual leave on an unlimited basis.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under Public Law 94-454, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, members of the Senior Executive Service (SES)
were able to accumulate annual leave on an unlimited basis. Section 201 of the Government Management Reform Act of
1994 (Pub. L. 103-356, enacted October 13, 1994) amended 5 U.S.C. 6304(f) to provide a 90-day (720-hour) limit
on the amount of annual leave an SES member may carry over from one leave year to the next.




Section 201 also contains a grandfather clause to allow individuals who were SES members on the effective date of the
law and who had accumulated more than 90 days (720 hours) of annual leave to retain as their personal leave ceiling the
annual leave they had accrued as of the effective date of the law. The personal leave ceiling is the maximum amount of
accrued annual leave an affected member can carry over from one leave year to the next. The personal leave ceiling is
subject to the existing reduction provisions contained in law and regulations.



We are amending paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 5 CFR 630.301 to implement the new 90-day (720-hour) limitation. Paragraph
(a) specifies the maximum limitation on annual leave accumulation for members of the SES. Paragraph (b) specifies
how leave is prorated when an employee serves part of a pay period in an SES position and part in a position outside the
SES. Paragraph (c) provides that SES members may retain their leave balances when they take a non-SES position, but
that the balance is subject to reduction under 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) until the balance reaches 30 days (240 hours) or 45 days
(360 hours) depending on the leave ceiling for the new position.


We are adding paragraph (d) to explain how the grandfather clause is to be applied to establish a personal leave ceiling
for SES members. The grandfather clause also applies to former career SES members who elected to retain SES leave benefits
under 5 U.S.C. 3392(c) following appointment to an Executive Schedule or equivalent position. The personal leave
ceiling does not include advanced annual leave or restored annual leave. Annual leave restored to an SES member under
5 U.S.C. 6304(d) will continue to be placed in a separate leave account and must be scheduled and used within the time
period specified in 5 CFR 630.306 or 630.309.


Public Law 103-356 provides for the reduction of the personal leave ceiling under the existing provisions of
5 U.S.C. 6304(c). Thus, if an SES member has a personal leave ceiling and uses more annual leave than he or she earns in
a leave year (or between the start of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, and the end of the 1994 leave
year), the personal leave ceiling is reduced by the difference at the start of the next leave year. If the personal leave
ceiling falls to or below 90 days (720 hours) at the end of a leave year, the member becomes subject to the 90-day (720-hour)
limit.



If an SES member with a personal leave ceiling earns more annual leave than used in a leave year (or between the start
of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, and the end of the 1994 leave year), the excess hours are forfeited
at the start of the next leave year. SES members are subject to the same provisions in the law and regulations for the
restoration of unused annual leave as apply to other employees (5 U.S.C. 6304(d) and 5 CFR 630.305 through 630.309).

If an SES member separates from the Government before the end of a leave year, the member is paid a lump-sum payment for
all accumulated annual leave (including any unused restored leave), even if the amount of leave exceeds the member's
personal leave ceiling. (See 5 U.S.C. 5551.)






Example: 

An SES member had 1,000 hours of annual leave at the beginning of the first pay period after October 13, 1994. The SES
member's personal leave ceiling would be 1,000 hours. If during the remainder of the 1994 leave year the member uses
100 hours more leave than earned, the member's personal leave ceiling for the 1995 leave year will be 900 hours (1,000
minus 100 hours). If during leave year 1995 the member earns 100 hours more leave than used, the member's personal leave
ceiling for the 1996 leave year will remain at 900 hours, and the excess 100 hours will be forfeited. Finally, if the
member separates from the Government on September 30, 1996, with 1,040 hours of accumulated annual leave, the member
will receive a lump-sum payment for 1,040 hours of annual leave at the member's then current rate of pay.

<TEXT>
 

If an SES member who had received a lump-sum payment for annual leave upon separation or retirement is reemployed in
the Federal Government before the expiration of the period covered by the lump-sum payment, he or she must refund to
the employing agency an amount equal to the pay covering the period between the date of reemployment and the expiration
of the lump-sum payment. The individual's annual leave account will be credited with an amount of leave equal to the
leave represented by the refund. (See 5 U.S.C. 6311.) If the individual is reemployed in a non-SES position, he or she
will be subject to the maximum annual leave ceiling for the new position_i.e., the 30-day or 45-day maximum annual
leave ceiling under 5 U.S.C. 6304 (a) or (b). 








Example: 

An SES member separated and received a lump-sum annual leave payment for 1,040 hours (130 days). Three months (i.e.,
60 workdays) later, the individual is reemployed in a GS-15 position. The employee must refund an amount of pay
equal to 560 hours (70 days). The employee's annual leave account is credited with 560 hours of annual leave. (

Note: 

Since 560 hours is more than maximum annual leave ceiling of 240 hours for the GS-15 position, the employee acquires
a leave ceiling of 560 hours (70 days). The leave ceiling will be reduced under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 6304(c), if
more annual leave is used than earned in any leave year, until it reaches 240 hours. In addition, annual leave earned
in a leave year must be used or be subject to forfeiture at the end of the leave year.) 






Finally, we are adding paragraph (e) to require agencies to maintain records of the amount of annual leave credited
and reduced when an SES member has a personal leave ceiling and to inform affected members of their initial ceiling
and any subsequent reduction. 



Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Delay in Effective Date



Section 201 of Public Law 103-356 became effective at the beginning of the first applicable pay period after
October 13, 1994, the date of enactment. In order to give practical effect to this legislation, I find that good cause
exists to waive the general notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Also, I find that good
cause exists for making this rule effective on October 14, 1994. The delay in the effective date of this rule is being
waived to cover employees as of the date required by the statute.



E.O. 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review



This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it will affect only Federal agencies and employees.

Subpart C_Annual Leave



2. In subpart C,  630.301 is revised to read as follows:



 630.301 

Annual leave accumulation_Senior Executive Service.



(a) Unused annual leave accrued by an employee while serving under an appointment in the Senior Executive Service
under 5 U.S.C. chapter 33, subchapter VIII, shall accumulate for use in succeeding years until it totals not more than
90 days (720 hours) at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period (or corresponding period for an employee
who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods) occurring in a calendar year.

(b) Annual leave accrued for any pay period during only a portion of which the employee served under an appointment
to the Senior Executive Service shall be prorated. Only that portion of the leave that is attributable to service in
the Senior Executive Service shall be subject to the 90-day (720-hour) limitation on accumulation of annual leave
provided in paragraph (a) of this section. Other annual leave accrued during the pay period shall be subject to the
limitations imposed by subsections (a), (b), and (c) of 5 U.S.C. 6304, as appropriate.

(c) When an employee in the Senior Executive Service moves to a position outside the Senior Executive Service, any
annual leave accumulated while serving in the Senior Executive Service that is in excess of the amount allowed for
the position by subsection (a), (b), or (c) of 5 U.S.C. 6304 shall remain to the employee's credit and shall be subject
to reduction under procedures identical to those described in 5 U.S.C. 6304(c).

(1) If the employee has more than 720 hours of annual leave at the time of the move and has a personal leave ceiling under
paragraph (d) of this section, the employee may not carry over to the next leave year an amount greater than the employee's
personal leave ceiling.

(2) If the employee has more than 720 hours of annual leave at the time of the move and does not have a personal leave ceiling
under paragraph (d) of this section, the employee may not carry over to the next leave year more than 720 hours.

(d) An employee in the Senior Executive Service who, as of the first day of the first pay period beginning after October
13, 1994, has accumulated annual leave in excess of 90 days (720 hours) is entitled to retain that leave as a personal
leave ceiling. The leave shall be credited to the employee and shall be subject to reduction in the following manner:

(1) Annual leave credited to an employee shall be based on the amount of annual leave accumulated by the employee as
of the end of the pay period preceding the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994. The credited leave shall
exclude_

(i) Any annual leave restored to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d); and

(ii) Any annual leave advanced to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6302(d) that had not yet been earned.

(2) Annual leave credited to an employee that is in excess of 90 days (720 hours) shall be subject to reduction in the
same manner as provided in 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) until the employee's accumulated annual leave is equal to or less than 90
days (720 hours). For the 1994 leave year, 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) shall be applied only for leave earned and used between the
start of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, and the end of the 1994 leave year.

(e) Agencies shall notify affected employees and maintain records on the accumulated annual leave credited to each
employee under paragraph (d) of this section and on any reductions in the credited annual leave made under 5 U.S.C.
6304(c). If the employee transfers to another agency, such records shall be provided to the gaining agency.

Amendment of the Class D and Class E Airspace; Fort Campbell, KY



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment corrects the geographic position coordinates of the Sabre Army Heliport and as a consequence the depiction
of the Fort Campbell, KY, Class D and Class E airspace. The current depiction of the southeastern clockwise thru the
southwestern boundary of the airspace is based on incorrect geographic position coordinates of the Sabre Army Heliport.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Request for Comments on the Rule



Although this action is in the form of a final rule, which involves correcting the coordinates of the Sabre Army Heliport
and as a consequence the depiction of the Fort Campbell Class D and Class E airspace, and was not preceded by notice and
public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES

 section. However, after the review of any comments and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date or to amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule and in determining whether additional rulemaking is needed. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule
that might suggest the need to modify the rule.

The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) corrects the geographic position coordinates
of the Sabre Army Heliport and as a consequence the depiction of the Fort Campbell, KY, Class D and Class E airspace.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6005 respectively of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace listed in this document
will be published subsequently in the Order.
Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need for a regulation to correct the
geographic position coordinates of the Sabre Army Heliport and as a consequence the depiction of the Fort Campbell,
KY, Class D and Class E airspace, in order to improve air safety. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedure
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Establishment of Class E Airspace; Georgetown, KY



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes Class E airspace at Georgetown, KY. A VOR/DME RWY 3 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure
(SIAP) has been developed for the Georgetown Scott County-Marshall Field Airport. Controlled airspace extending
upward from 700 feet above the surface (AGL) is needed to accommodate this SIAP and for instrument flight rules (IFR)
operations at the airport. The operating status of the airport will change from VFR to include IFR operations concurrent
with publication of the SIAP.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History



On August 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Georgetown, KY, (59 FR 43308). This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for
IFR operations at Georgetown Scott County-Marshall Field Airport. Interested parties were invited to participate
in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to
the proposal were received.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. This amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Class E airspace areas designated as a surface areas for an airport are published in Paragraph 6005 of
FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994. The Class E airspace designation listed in
this document will be published subsequently in the Order.


The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace extending upward from
700 feet AGL at Georgetown, Ky, to accomodate the VOR/DME RWY 3 SIAP and for IFR operations at the Georgetown Scott County-Marshall
Field Airport. The operating status of the airport will be changed from VFR to include IFR operations concurrent with
publication of the SIAP.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION:

 Final rule; Order; Denying Rehearing.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing an order denying the requests for rehearing of
Order No. 566-A. The rehearing requests deal only with the requirement of Standard of Conduct H which requires
natural gas pipelines to post on their pipeline Electronic Bulletin Boards marketing affiliate discount information
24 hours after gas flows. The Commission denied the requests to institute an earlier posting time finding that posting
of discount transactions after gas flows strikes the proper balance between providing public information to detect
a pattern of discriminatory treatment and ensuring that the posting will not produce adverse effects on competition
between marketing affiliates and non-affiliates.

On November 14, 1994, Indicated Companies,

1

 Natural Gas Clearinghouse (NGC), and Philadelphia Gas Works (Philadelphia Gas) filed requests for rehearing of
Order No. 566-A

2

 as it relates to the requirement under Standard of Conduct H for pipelines to post on their pipeline Electronic Bulletin
Boards (EBBs) information concerning discounts provided to pipeline marketing affiliates.

3

 Standard H requires pipelines to post information on marketing affiliate discounts within 24 hours after gas flows
under the discounted transaction. The rehearing petitions request that the Commission revise Standard H to require
posting when the pipeline offers a discount to a marketing affiliate. The Commission denies the requests for rehearing.








Background 



In Order No. 497,

4

 the Commission promulgated Standard of Conduct I (now Standard H) which provided that ``if a pipeline offers a transportation
discount to an affiliated marketer, it must make a comparable discount contemporaneously available to all similarly
situated non-affiliated shippers.'' At the same time, the Commission promulgated  250.16 which required
pipelines to file with the Commission information about discounts requested, offered, or provided to marketing
affiliates within 15 days after the close of the billing period and to provide electronic access to such information
once the service has begun.

5

 In Order No. 497-D, the Commission eliminated the requirement that pipelines file the marketing affiliate
discount information with the Commission, requiring instead that the pipelines provide this information on their
EBBs.

6

 







The Commission issued two orders addressing the operative posting time for the marketing affiliate information.
In 

Sunrise Energy

,

7

 the Commission interpreted the prior regulations as not requiring pipelines to provide notice of discount negotiations
with marketing affiliates. On the other hand, in 

Colorado Interstate,



8

 the Commission held that to comply with the prior regulations, pipelines had to post offers made during negotiations
on their EBBs in addition to posting the final offer. 






In Order No. 566, the Commission followed 

Colorado Interstate

 and required posting of discount information when an offer to a marketing affiliate was made. Many pipelines sought
rehearing of Order No. 566, contending that the prior regulations did not require posting when offers were made and
that imposing such a requirement would result in disclosure of confidential competitive information which could
permit non-affiliated marketers to steal deals being negotiated by marketing affiliates. For example, the pipelines
argued that disclosure of information about discount offers to their marketing affiliates could enable competitors
to determine the marketing affiliates' customers and interfere with the affiliates' negotiations.

In Order No. 566-A, the Commission reevaluated its posting requirements to strike a more appropriate balance
between preserving competition between marketing affiliates and non-affiliated shippers and providing for disclosure
of marketing affiliate discount information. The Commission retained the previous requirement that a pipeline
making a discount offer to a marketing affiliate must make a comparable offer contemporaneously available to similarly
situated non-affiliated shippers. The Commission, however, then provided that details of the discount actually
provided to the marketing affiliate be posted on the pipeline's EBB within 24 hours of the time gas flows under the discount
transaction. 


Requests for Rehearing 



The three parties requesting rehearing contend that delaying EBB posting until after gas flows under a discounted
transaction tilts too far towards protecting pipeline marketing affiliates while not providing sufficient protection
against discrimination to non-affiliated marketer and other competitors. They request that the Commission require
posting of marketing affiliate discount offers at the time when an offer of a discount to a marketing affiliate is made.


Indicated Companies and NGC argue that posting after gas flows does not sufficiently protect non-affiliated marketers
during the negotiating period, which they characterize as the most critical period. They contend that if a pipeline
offers a discount to a marketing affiliate for a sale to a particular customer, a non-affiliated marketers may lose
the sale to that customer unless the non-affiliated marketer is contemporaneously informed of the discount offer.


NGC contends that even assuming that posting of discount offers to marketing affiliates when the offer is made might
permit non-affiliated marketers to enter into the bidding process with respect to a potential customer, the non-affiliate
would not be stealing a market, but restoring competition. It further argues that immediate posting of discount offers
to marketing affiliates is needed to detect unfair collaboration between pipelines and their marketing affiliates
in which the affiliates know even before requesting a discount that the pipeline will grant whatever discount is necessary
to make the sale. Finally, NGC requests that, if the Commission determines not to require contemporaneous EBB posting,
the Commission should, at least, require posting of all offers, whether accepted or not. It suggests that offers rejected
by marketing affiliates be posted immediately, offers that lapse be posted when gas would have flowed, and accepted
offers be posted when gas flows.

Philadelphia Gas contends that pipelines should be required to post marketing affiliate discount information contemporaneously
with the discount offer to restore competitive equality between the Commission's capacity release system and the
pipelines' sale of interruptible service. It asserts that LDCs are competitively disadvantaged because capacity
release transactions must be immediately posted on pipeline EBBs, thereby enabling pipelines to undercut LDCs'
release transactions, while pipeline interruptible transactions are not subject to a similar contemporaneous
posting requirement. Philadelphia Gas further contends that posting prior to gas flow would benefit LDCs, and their
customers, by permitting competitors of the marketing affiliate the opportunity to compete for a specific transaction.



Discussion 


The Commission denies the requests for rehearing. The Commission's revision to Standard H in Order No. 566-A
essentially maintains the same regulatory scheme that existed under Order No. 497. Pipelines are required to make
any discounts offered to marketing affiliates contemporaneously available to similarly situated non-affiliated
shippers. But pipelines are not required to post detailed information about marketing affiliate discounts until
after the transportation transaction has begun. 
As the Commission found in Order No. 566-A, its marketing affiliate regulations should strike the proper balance
between the need to provide information about marketing affiliate discounts and the need to ensure that affiliates
can compete on a relatively equal basis with non-affiliated marketers. Posting marketing affiliate discount offers
during the negotiating process could provide non-affiliated marketers with competitive advantages over marketing
affiliates by providing the non-affiliates with important competitive information about marketing affiliate
deals. Such information could provide non-affiliated marketers with the opportunity to interfere in negotiations
between pipeline marketing affiliates and customers. On the other hand, non-affiliated marketers are not faced
with a similar risk since information about non-affiliate deals is not publicly available to marketing affiliates.
At the same time, posting of marketing affiliate information after gas flows still provides the market with sufficient
information about marketing affiliate transactions to deter discriminatory treatment. The primary purpose of
the posting requirement was to permit monitoring of marketing affiliate transactions, not to assist non-affiliates
in their direct competition with marketing affiliates for particular customers. 

The Commission disagrees with the petitioners' contention that posting of discount offers to marketing affiliates
after gas flows tips the competitive balance too far in favor of marketing affiliates. Non-affiliated marketers
do not need to know of offers to marketing affiliates to negotiate with potential customers. During the negotiations,
non-affiliates can request discounts from the pipeline, and, under Standard H, the pipeline is required to provide
the non-affiliate with the discount if it has offered a discount to a marketing affiliate in similar circumstances.
Similarly, an LDC, like Philadelphia Gas, is not disadvantaged by the after-the-fact posting requirement because
it can request competing offers from non-affiliated marketers knowing the pipeline must provide the non-affiliate
with the same transportation discount offered to a marketing affiliate. 

By requiring that marketing affiliate discount information is posted after gas flows, the Commission has established
a mechanism to ensure that pipelines honor their obligation to provide appropriate discounts to non-affiliates.
A pipeline is unlikely to deny a legitimate discount request from a non-affiliate because the pipeline knows that
its discount to its marketing affiliate will almost immediately be posted on the EBB enabling the non-affiliate to
detect potential discrimination. Posting within 24 hours of gas flow also is early enough so that a non-affiliate,
which has negotiated its own independent deal with a customer, can still obtain the same discount for transportation,
during the same time period, as the marketing affiliate. Thus, posting of marketing affiliate discount information
after gas flows establishes the proper balance between the interests in providing sufficient public disclosure
of marketing affiliate discount information to deter discriminatory treatment and ensuring that marketing affiliates
can compete on an equal basis with non-affiliated shippers during the negotiation process.

Philadelphia Gas argues that an earlier posting also would be desirable because it would, to some extent, create a
better competitive balance between released capacity and pipeline interruptible transportation by requiring
that some price information for interruptible capacity will be posted at the same time as prices for capacity release
transactions. The Commission does not find that piecemeal tinkering with the marketing affiliate regulations is
the proper method for correcting asserted deficiencies with the capacity release mechanism. The Commission is in
the process of examining its capacity release program and issues relating to disclosure of prices for interruptible
capacity are better considered as part of an overall review of the capacity release program. 
The Commission rejects the suggestion by NGC that the Commission, at least, modify the requirement to require immediate
posting of rejected discount offers to marketing affiliates and posting of lapsed offers when gas would have flowed
under the offer. Posting of rejected discount offers would violate the principle against disclosure of competitive
information during negotiations. For example, an affiliate may reject one offer as a prelude to continuing negotiations
toward obtaining a larger discount. Similarly, determining when an offer has lapsed would be difficult. 
The Commission fails to discern the relationship between the posting of discount offers to marketing affiliates
and NGC's concern that, in most cases, the pipeline will grant whatever discount the marketing affiliate requires
to complete a deal. In NGC's scenario, the marketing affiliate's discount will be posted on the pipeline's EBB after
gas flows so that the non-affiliate can determine whether its request for a discount was unfairly denied. 

The Commission concludes that posting of discount transactions after gas flows strikes the proper balance between
providing public information to detect a pattern of discriminatory treatment and ensuring that the posting will
not produce adverse effects on competition between marketing affiliates and non-affiliates. Accordingly, the
Commission will deny the rehearing requests.

Schedules of Controlled Substances; Extension of Temporary Placement of 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethyl- amine
in Schedule I 
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice. 
 


 
 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to extend the temporary
scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA) in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances
Act (CSA). The temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA is due to expire on January 6, 1995. This notice will extend
the temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA for six months or until rule making proceeding are completed, whichever
occurs first. 
 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On January 6, 1994, the Acting Administrator of the DEA published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 671) amending  1308.11(g) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA
into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(g). This final rule, which
became effective on the date of publication, was based on findings by the Acting Administrator that the temporary
scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Section 201(h)(2)
of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2)) requires that the temporary scheduling of a substance expires at the end of one year
from the effective date of the order. However, during the pendency of proceedings under 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1) with respect
to the substance, temporary scheduling of that substance may be extended for up to six months. Proceedings for the
scheduling of a substance under 21 U.S.C. 811(a) may be initiated by the Attorney General (delegated to the Administrator
of the DEA pursuant to 28 CFR 0.100 and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 28 CFR 0.104) on his own motion,
at the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or on the petition of any interested party. Such proceedings
regarding 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA has been initiated by the Deputy Administrator. 
 
 


Therefore, the temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA, which is due to expire on January 6, 1995, may be extended
until July 6, 1995, or until proceedings initiated in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(a) are completed, whichever occurs
first. Pursuant to U.S.C. 811(h)(2) the Deputy Administrator hereby orders that the temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA
be extended until July 6, 1995, or until the conclusion of scheduling proceedings initiated in accordance with 21
U.S.C. 811(a), whichever occurs first. 
 
The Deputy Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that extension of the temporary placement of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA
in Schedule I of the CSA will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

. This action involves the extension of temporary control of a substance with no currently accepted medical use in
the United States. 
 
The six month extension of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA in Schedule I of the CSA is not a significant regulatory action for the
purposes of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 of September 30, 1993. Drug scheduling matters are not subject to review
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the provisions of E.O. 12866,  3(d)(1). This regulation
responds to an emergency situation posing no imminent hazard to the public safety and is essential to criminal law
enforcement function of the United States. 
 
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been
determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a
Federalism Assessment.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a new animal
drug application (NADA) filed by SmithKline Beecham Animal Health Products. The NADA provides for use of albendazole
suspension (Valbazen

 

) as an anthelmintic in sheep. The regulations are also amended to establish a tolerance for albendazole residue in
sheep liver.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 SmithKline Beecham Animal Health Products, 1600 Paoli Pike, West Chester, PA 19380, filed NADA 140-934, which
provides for oral use of a 4.55 percent albendazole suspension (Valbazen

 

) as an anthelmintic in sheep. It is used for removal and control of: Adult liver flukes; heads and segments of common
and fringed tapeworms; adult and fourth stage larvae of certain stomach worms (brown stomach worm, barberpole worm,
and small stomach worm); adult and fourth stage larvae of certain intestinal worms (thread-necked intestinal worm,
Cooper's worm, bankrupt worm, nodular worm, and large-mouth bowel worm); and adult and larval stages of lungworms.



The NADA is approved as of November 10, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.45a to reflect the approval.
Additionally, the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 556.34 to establish a tolerance for albendazole residue in sheep
liver. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary.
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(ii)), this
approval qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning November 10, 1994, because the application contains
reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the
approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

Allowances Received by Members of the Armed Forces in Connection With Moves to New Permanent Duty Stations

ACTION:

 Temporary regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains temporary regulations relating to the exclusion from gross income under section 61 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) of certain allowances received by members of the Armed Forces in connection with
a change of permanent duty station. The temporary regulations are required because of amendments to the law made by
section 13213(a)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993), 107 Stat. 473 (1993), which redefined
the term 

moving expenses

 under section 217(b) of the Code. Persons affected by the temporary regulations are members of the Armed Forces. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 61 and 217 of the Internal
Revenue Code (Code) that are required because of the amendment of section 217(b) by OBRA 1993. In Notice 94-59,
1994-1 C.B. 371, the IRS announced its intention to issue guidance to clarify that certain allowances received
by members of the Armed Forces continue to be excludable from gross income notwithstanding the amendment of section
217(b). 


Explanation of Provisions 


Section 217(g) of the Code provides that a member of the Armed Forces on active duty who moves pursuant to a military
order and incident to a permanent change of station does not include in income reimbursements or allowances for moving
or storage expenses, or the value of moving and storage services 
furnished in-kind. For purposes of section 217(g), moving 
expenses are defined in section 217(b). OBRA 1993 amended section 217(b) by narrowing the definition of deductible
moving 
expenses. 
As a result of this amendment, questions have arisen 
concerning the federal tax treatment of certain allowances 
provided by the Department of Defense to members of the Armed 

Forces (and by the Department of Transportation to members of the Coast Guard) in connection with a transfer to a new
permanent duty station. These allowances include: 
(1) A dislocation allowance, intended to partially reimburse expenses (e.g., lease forfeitures, temporary living
charges in hotels, and breakage of household goods in transit) incurred in relocating a household; 
(2) A temporary lodging expense, intended to partially offset the added living expenses of temporary lodging (up
to 10 days) within the United States;
(3) A temporary lodging allowance, intended to help defray higher than normal living costs (for up to 60 days) outside
the United States; and 

(4) A moving-in housing allowance, intended to defray costs (e.g., rental agent fees, home-security improvements,
and supplemental heating equipment) associated with occupying leased quarters outside the United States. 
Section 1.61-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations provides, in part, that subsistence and uniform allowances
granted to members of the Armed Forces, Coast and Geodetic Survey (now known as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration), and Public 
Health Service, and amounts received by them as commutation of 
quarters, are to be excluded from gross income. Similarly, the 
value of quarters or subsistence furnished to such persons is excluded from gross income. These exclusions from gross
income 
of quarters and subsistence allowances paid to members of the 
Armed Forces are ones of long-standing, dating back to 1925. See 

Jones

 v. 

United States,

 60 Ct. Cl. 552 (1925).

The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that the four above-referenced allowances provided by the Department
of Defense (and by the Department of Transportation), to the extent not excludable under other provisions of the Code
(such as section 217(g) or section 132(g)), are to be treated as subsistence or quarters allowances. Section 1.61-22T
is added to provide that these allowances are excludable from gross income. The regulations also clarify that no deduction
is allowed for any expenses incurred in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty station to the extent the
expenses are reimbursed by an excludable allowance. 
However, any expense that meets the definition of a 

moving expense

 as defined in section 217(b) and is not reimbursed continues to be deductible under current law. 
The temporary regulations are effective with respect to allowances for expenses incurred after December 31, 1993.
Allowances for expenses incurred prior to January 1, 1994, in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty station
are excludable under section 217(g). 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 

a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been 
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 
U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. 



Drafting Information_The principal author of these temporary regulations is Leonard H. Friedman, Office of Assistant
Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated
in their development.

ACTION:

 Temporary regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains temporary regulations relating to Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate.
The temporary regulations authorize employers to establish systems that permit employees to make certain changes
to their Forms W-4 electronically. The regulations provide employers and employees with guidance necessary
to comply with the law and affect employers who choose to establish electronic systems and employees who use them.
The text of these temporary regulations also serves as the text of the proposed regulations set forth in the notice
of proposed rulemaking on this subject in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the 

Federal Register

.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act 


The collection of information contained in these regulations has been reviewed and, pending receipt and evaluation
of public comments, approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1545-1435. 
For further information concerning this collection of information, and where to submit comments on the collection
of information and the accuracy of the estimated burden, and suggestions for reducing this burden, please refer to
the preamble to the cross-referencing notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Proposed Rules section of this
issue of the 

Federal Register

. 


Background 


On April 15, 1994, a notice of proposed rulemaking [EE-45-93] containing proposed regulations relating
to Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 18057). The proposed regulations would authorize employers to establish electronic systems for employees
to use in filing changes to their Forms W-4. These electronic systems could not be used for Forms W-4 required
upon commencement of employment, on which more than 10 withholding exemptions are claimed, or, if the employee is
expected to earn more than $200 per week, on which exemption from withholding is claimed. In addition, under the proposed
regulations an employer would have to retain a paper option for those employees who are eligible to use the electronic
system but do not wish to do so. 
Written comments responding to the notice have been received, and a public hearing was held on July 15, 1994. The commentators
generally approved of the proposed regulations, but also urged that the IRS go farther. Specifically, they recommended
that electronic systems be allowed for all Forms W-4 without exception, and that employers be allowed to mandate
the use of an electronic system rather than be required to maintain a paper option for their employees. One commentator,
however, was concerned about employees being overwhelmed by the transition to electronic systems and requested
confirmation that a paper option would continue to be available. 


Explanation of Provisions 


While the IRS has not concluded its evaluation of the merits of these recommendations, it has been decided that the
final regulations on this subject will not further restrict situations where electronic Forms W-4 can be used.
In order to allow the use of electronic systems for filing Forms W-4 as quickly as possible, these temporary regulations
authorize employers to establish electronic systems as contemplated in the proposed regulations, effective immediately.

The IRS invites further comments on the electronic filing of Forms W-4 and the practical implementation of systems
that make such filing possible. To this end, a notice of proposed rulemaking appears in the Proposed Rules section
of this issue of the 

Federal Register

. While the text of these temporary regulations also serves as the text for those proposed regulations, comments are
specifically requested on whether electronic systems should be allowed for additional categories of Forms W-4
and the extent to which employers should be allowed to mandate the use of an electronic system. Those further comments
will be considered in determining the appropriate balance between the advantages to employers of fully electronic
systems, ensuring adequate employee access, and the IRS's concerns relating to enforcement. This expanded comment
process and, in particular, comments and insights arising from the experience of employers and the IRS during this
interim period, is expected to provide information that is very helpful in developing final regulations.

In response to requests for clarification, these temporary regulations differ from the previously proposed regulations
in two ways. First, the previously proposed regulations would have required the electronic system established by
the employer to document occasions of employee access. The temporary regulations provide that the system need not
document all such occasions; the system need only document those occasions of employee access that result in a change
to the Form W-4. Second, the previously proposed regulations would have required the employer to supply the
IRS with a hard copy of the electronic Form W-4 upon request. The temporary regulations clarify that, while the
hard copy must contain exactly the same information as the paper Form W-4, it need not be a facsimile of the paper
form. 
One commentator expressed concern about the requirement that the electronic filing contain exactly the same information
as the paper Form W-4. This commentator stated that such a requirement would be unduly burdensome if it encompassed
the worksheets accompanying the form as well as the Form W-4 certificate itself. That result is not contemplated.
The worksheets are intended merely as a convenience to the employee, to assist the employee in completing the form.
The IRS therefore does not anticipate that the worksheets would be included as part of the information in the electronic
filing. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations and,
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on their impact on small business.

 



Drafting Information:

 The principal author of these regulations is Russ Weinheimer, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits
and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their
development.

Procedure for Removal of Local Labor Organization Officers

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends subpart B of 29 CFR part 417, the regulation pertaining to the procedure for removal of local
labor organization officers pursuant to section 401(h) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of
1959, as amended (LMRDA). Section 417.16 presently gives the Secretary of Labor the authority to bring suit against
a union after a member has filed a complaint with the Secretary alleging that the local labor organization has failed
to follow the officer removal procedures contained in the organization's constitution and bylaws. The amendment
deletes that language, which purports to give the Secretary general authority to bring suit against a union for failing
to follow its officer removal procedures even if the inadequacy of the procedure has not been established. This change
brings the regulation into conformity with a court of appeals decision that held that the Secretary lacks such authority.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background and Overview 



Title IV of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, as amended (LMRDA), governs the election and
removal of labor organization officers. Section 401(h) of the LMRDA (29 U.S.C. 481(h)) provides that if the Secretary
of Labor, upon application of a member of a local labor organization, finds after a hearing in accordance with the Administrative
Procedure Act, that the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization do not provide an adequate procedure for
the removal of an elected officer guilty of serious misconduct, such officer may be removed for cause shown and after
notice and hearing, by the members in good standing voting in a secret ballot conducted by the officers of such labor
organization in accordance with its constitution and bylaws insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions
of Title IV of the LMRDA. 

The Department had previously interpreted section 401(h), when read in conjunction with section 402(a), as additionally
granting the Secretary of Labor the authority to file suit against a union for failure to follow removal procedures
whose adequacy has not been challenged. Section 402(a) states in part that ``(a) a member of a labor organization (1)
who has exhausted the remedies available under the constitution and bylaws of such organization and of any parent
body, or (2) who has invoked such available remedies without obtaining a final decision within three calendar months
after their invocation, may file a complaint with the Secretary within one calendar month thereafter alleging the
violation of any provision of section 401 (

including violation of the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization pertaining to the election and removal
of officers

) (emphasis added) * * *.'' Subpart B of 29 CFR part 417 implements this interpretation. 

In 

Donovan 

v. 

Hotel, Motel & Restaurant Employees Local 19,

 700 F.2d 539 (9th Cir. 1983), however, the court held, after examining the legislative history of the Act, that the
LMRDA does not authorize the Secretary to bring civil action against a union for failure to follow its concededly adequate
officer removal procedure. 

Local 19

 rejected the Secretary's reliance on section 402(a) as a basis for extending his authority under section 401(h) to
intervene in officer removal proceedings where an adequate removal procedure exists. The court concluded that those
regulations found in subpart B of 29 CFR part 417 which purport to give the Secretary general authority to intervene
in union affairs upon a finding that a union has failed to follow its adequate removal procedures are void for lack of
statutory authority. 



Local 19

 is the only judicial decision that addresses this issue, and the Department has determined, upon review, that the
holding of the court in 

Local 19

 is correct. The Department, therefore, on June 16, 1994, published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

, 59 FR 31056, to delete the language in subpart B of 29 CFR part 417 granting the Secretary authority to file suit against
a union for failure to follow its adequate officer removal procedures. 



II. Comments On the Proposal and the Department's Responses and Decision 



Six comments were received from the public; four from labor organizations and two from other organizations. 

The following national and international labor organizations commented on the proposed rule:

 


_Fire Fighters 
_Food and Commercial Workers 
_Clothing and Textile Workers 
_Laborers

 


The other organizations which commented on the proposed rule are:

_Acuna, Casas & Araiza 

_Association for Union Democracy, Inc.

 


The Department has carefully reviewed and considered all statements made in the comments in developing this final
rule. The following is a summary of the comments and the Department's responses. 



A. Discussion of the Comments 



All four labor organizations supported the amendment. Each organization addressed why they believed the amendment
is necessary, arguing generally that the court in 

Local 19

 was correct in its interpretation of the officer removal provision as not granting the Secretary authority to file
suit against a union for not following its concededly adequate officer removal procedure and, therefore, the Department
should amend its regulatory language to reflect the court's decision.

The Clothing and Textile Workers referenced the legislative history of the LMRDA presented by the court in 

Local 19

 to demonstrate that the Secretary is not authorized to bring civil action against a union for not following its adequate
officer removal procedure. 

The Clothing and Textile Workers also indicated that the 

Local 19

 decision is buttressed by the general proposition that Congress intended that unions should govern their own internal
affairs as expressed by the Supreme Court: 

In drafting Titles II through Title VI, Congress was guided by the general principle that unions should be left free
to ``operate their own affairs as far as possible.'' S. Rep. No. 1684, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5 (1958) * * *
Given certain minimum standards, ``individual members are fully competent to regulate union affairs.'' 

Steelworkers 

v. 

Sadlowski, 

457 U.S. 102, 117 (1982). 

The Laborers also noted that the legislative history of the LMRDA indicates that Congress did not intend the Secretary's
authority to include suits to compel union compliance with adequate removal procedures. In addition, the Laborers
noted that the amendment does not leave aggrieved members without a remedy, because any member who believes his union
has failed to comply with its constitutional procedures may bring a contract enforcement action in federal court
and most union members may bring internal union charges against union officers who fail to carry out their constitutional
duties. 

The Fire Fighters noted that it is important for the Department to file suit if a union does not have an adequate officer
removal procedure ``to ensure that a fair democratic procedure be followed,'' but the Department should not interfere
with a union's adequate officer removal procedures. 

The Food and Commercial Workers support the amendment but also suggested the following three additional changes
to the regulations in order to bring subpart B more closely into conformity with 

Local 19:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941221-0-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941221-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Delete ``, or (3) has violated the principles governing adequate removal procedures under  417.2(b)''
at the end of proposed  417.16(a). Any member alleging that the local union does not have adequate procedures
for the removal of officers guilty of serious misconduct must follow the procedures of subpart A of 29 CFR part 417.
Therefore, the international argued that this language is merely a duplication of subpart A procedures for determining
whether the union's officer removal procedures are adequate.

(2) Change the language in proposed  417.16(a) which reads ``(2) has violated the procedures agreed to with
the Director'' to the following: ``(2) with respect to the case which was the subject of the prior application filed
with the Office of Labor-Management Standards charging inadequate procedures, has failed to implement the provisions
agreed to with the Director.'' The international indicated that this change would clarify that the limits of the authority
of the Department in officer removal cases are set by the substantive procedure of section 401(h) of the LMRDA.

(3) Change ``Title IV'' in the first sentence of  417.17 to ``section 401(h).'' The international believes
that this modification would clarify the scope of the regulation because Title IV is ``certainly inexact and potentially
misleading.''

Both of the other commenters opposed the amendment. The firm of Acuna, Casas & Araiza argued that the amendment
is ambiguous as written because it fails to state any steps the Secretary will take after a member has exhausted internal
union procedures. They further argued that 

Local 19

 is the only judicial decision interpreting the officer removal regulation and, therefore, is not definitive.

The Association for Union Democracy, Inc. generally argued that the court's reasoning in 

Local 19

 is unpersuasive and the Department should not amend its regulation based on a single court decision. The Association
disagreed with the court's reliance on Senate Report No. 187 and the Supreme Court's opinion in 

United Steelworkers

 v. 

Sadlowski

 for the proposition that Congress did not intend for courts to ``interfere'' in internal union affairs. In summary,
this organization argued that an analysis of other judicial decisions, the language of Title IV governing the minimum
standards for election procedures, the overall purpose of the LMRDA as well as the way in which some unions operate
reveal that Congress intended the Secretary to have the authority to compel a union to follow its adequate officer
removal procedure.

The Association for Union Democracy stated,




Our primary concern about the Department's proposal to concede lack of authority in this area stems from our knowledge
that union constitutions often do not mean what they say; or they mean only what the union officers say they mean. Indeed
there is a whole body of judicial precedent, beginning with 

English

 v. 

Cunningham,

 284 F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir. 1980), that accords judicial deference to the interpretation of union constitutions by union
officials. Moreover, by virtue of their effective control over the implementation of constitutional process, union
officers can often subvert that process and render facially adequate removal procedures meaningless, and thus inadequate
in reality.



B. The Department's Responses and Decision



After considering the comments, the Department has decided to amend the regulations governing the officer removal
procedures of local labor organizations as proposed at 59 FR 31056 with slight revisions as discussed below.

We agree with the comments by the labor organizations which support the court's interpretation in 

Local 19

 of the Act's officer removal provision as limiting the Secretary's authority to file suit against a union to cases
in which the union's officer removal procedure has been determined to be inadequate by the Department.

After carefully considering the comments of the Association for Union Democracy and Acuna, Casas and Araiza opposing
the amendment and questioning the court's reasoning in 

Local 19,

 the Department has concluded that their arguments are not as persuasive as those of the court which clearly demonstrate
through a thorough analysis of relevant legislative history, prior judicial decisions, and the language of the Act,
that Congress did not intend section 401(h) to grant the Secretary the authority to file suit against a union for failure
to follow its concededly adequate officer removal procedures. Furthermore, a union member is not without a legal
remedy if his organization fails to follow its adequate removal procedure. Any union member, as referenced in the
comments of the Laborers, may sue his or her labor organization for failure to comply with those provisions of its constitution
and bylaws governing officer removal procedures. In response to Acuna, Casas and Araiza's argument that the amendment
fails to state any steps the Secretary will take after a member has exhausted internal union procedures, we note that
this matter is set forth in 29 CFR 417.17.

In response to the United Food and Commercial Workers' suggestion of additional changes to the officer removal regulations,
the Department has concluded the following:

(1) The language of 29 CFR 417.16(a)(3) is not duplicative of subpart A because each provision addresses different
aspects of the Department's officer removal regulatory process. Subpart A of 29 CFR part 417 prescribes rules for
determining the adequacy of a union's constitution and bylaws for the removal of officers of a local labor organization.
If the Department determines that a union's officer removal provision is inadequate, the union may resolve this matter
by conducting a secret ballot vote by the members in good standing after notice and hearing, as prescribed by section
401(h) of the Act. 29 CFR 417.16(a)(3) provides that a member may file a complaint with the Department if the union's
implementation of this subsequent remedial measure of notice, hearing, and secret ballot vote is not conducted in
accordance with the principles governing adequate removal procedures as defined by  417.2(b). Hence, the
language of 29 CFR 417.16(a)(3) does not duplicate that of subpart A. It references the adequacy of remedial action
taken after a subpart A procedure. The Department, therefore, is not deleting any language of 29 CFR 417.16(3). However,
in order to clarify that subpart B covers the failure of a union to act appropriately after a subpart A procedure the
heading will be changed to read: Procedures Upon Failure of Union to Take Appropriate Remedial Action Following Subpart
A Procedures.

(2) The Department believes that the proposed language in  417.16(a) is clear and is consistent with the 

Local 19

 decision. When a union has entered into a stipulation with the Director to comply with the provisions of section 401(h)
and thereafter violates the procedures agreed to in that stipulation, subpart B action is appropriate. The proposed
language in  417.16(a) addresses this situation and the Department does not believe that any amendment to the
language is necessary or desirable.

(3) The Department agrees that amending certain language in 29 CFR 417.17 would assist in defining the scope of the
regulation. Therefore the Department will amend the language of  417.17 by replacing the words ``Title IV''
with ``section 401(h)''.



Administrative Requirements



A. Executive Order 12866



The Department of Labor has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in section
3(f) of Executive Order 12866 in that it will not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities, (2) create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency, (3) materially alter the budgetary impact
of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof, or (4) raise
novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth
in Executive Order 12866.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Agency Head has certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities
as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The rule will only apply to local labor organizations and would decrease
the regulation of such labor organizations. However, the Department has determined that labor organizations regulated
pursuant to the statutory authority granted under the LMRDA do not constitute small entities. Therefore, a regulatory
flexibility analysis is not required.

 417.16 

Initiation of proceedings. 



(a) Any member of a local labor organization may file a complaint with the Office of Labor-Management Standards alleging
that following a finding by the Assistant Secretary pursuant to subpart A that the constitution and bylaws of the labor
organization pertaining to the removal of officers are inadequate, or a stipulation of compliance with the provisions
of section 401(h) of the Act reached with the Director in connection with a prior charge of the inadequacy of a union's
constitution and bylaws to remove officers, as provided in subpart A of this part, the labor organization (1) has failed
to act within a reasonable time, or (2) has violated the procedures agreed to with the Director, or (3) has violated
the principles governing adequate removal procedures under  417.2(b). 

(b) The complaint must be filed pursuant to section 402(a) of the Act within one calendar month after one of the two following
conditions has been met: (1) The member has exhausted the remedies available to him under the constitution and bylaws
of the organization, or (2) the member has invoked such remedies without obtaining a final decision within three calendar
months after invoking them. 



 417.17 

Investigation of complaint and court action. 



The Office of Labor-Management Standards shall investigate such complaint, and if upon such investigation the Secretary
finds probable cause to believe that a violation of section 401(h) of the Act has occurred and has not been remedied,
the Secretary shall within 60 days after the filing of such complaint, bring a civil action against the labor organization
in the district court of the United States for the district in which such labor organization maintains its principal
office, to direct the conduct of a hearing and vote upon the removal of officer(s) under the supervision of the Assistant
Secretary as provided in section 402(b) of the Act.

National Service Life Insurance 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs.


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulation. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations regarding National Service Life Insurance
(NSLI) to provide that when an interest rate change is required on an NSLI variable rate loan the effective date of the
new interest rate will be on or after the first day of October on which the rate change is made in the insurance automatic
data processing system, and that such new rate shall remain in effect for not less than one year after the date of establishment.
This action is being taken to allow sufficient time to make all necessary modifications to the Insurance ADP system
without any adverse impact on NSLI policyholders and VA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On page 45254 of the 

Federal Register

 of September 1, 1994, VA published a proposed regulatory amendment to provide that when an interest rate change is
required on an NSLI variable rate loan the effective date of the new interest rate will be on or after the first day of
October on which the rate change is made in the Insurance Automatic Data Processing system, and that such new rate shall
remain in effect for not less than one year after the date of establishment. 




Interested parties were given 30 days in which to submit written comments, suggestions or objections regarding the
proposed amendment. No written comments were received and the proposed amendment is hereby adopted without change
as set forth below. 

The Secretary of Veterans Affairs hereby certifies that this final regulation will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C.
601-612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this final regulation is, therefore, exempt from the initial and final
regulatory analyses requirements in sections 603 and 604. The reason for this certification is that this final regulation
will affect only certain Government life insurance policyholders. It will, therefore, have no significant direct
impact on small entities in terms of compliance costs, paperwork requirements, or effects on competition. 


The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number for this regulation is 64.103.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; State of Iowa 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final action approves the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the state of Iowa. The revision includes
updating several incorporations by reference and conformity to Federal regulations which strengthen maintenance
of established air quality standards. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Beginning with its initial submission in 1972, the state of Iowa has operated a federally approved SIP that has implemented
the various requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act) and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). During the past two decades,
numerous revisions and updates have been made to the SIP in response to new Federal requirements. 



On May 5, 1994, the state of Iowa requested an SIP revision under the authority and signature of the Governor's designee,
Larry J. Wilson, Director, Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). This submission has been deemed complete
in accordance with the criteria specified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The state has provided evidence of the lawful
adoption of regulations, public notice, and public hearing requirements. 



Rule Revisions for the SIP 



The state has adopted a total of five revisions in two actions by the Environmental Protection Commission (EPC). In
the first action, effective January 12, 1994, the state amends its rules in paragraph 23.2(3)g with respect to training
fires. In the state's previous rule, fires set for training fire-fighting employees required notification of the
director at least one week prior to the event. The state has determined that it desires to make this requirement for
notification consistent with the requirements in 40 CFR 61.145, as amended through March 5, 1992. The Federal requirement
specifies 10 days' notification which the state now adopts. 

In the second action, effective April 20, 1994, the state amended four rules now submitted as revisions to the SIP.

1. In Iowa rule 567-22.4, the state previously adopted by reference 40 CFR 52.21, as amended through February
3, 1992, with respect to special requirements for major stationary sources located in areas designated attainment
or unclassified (PSD). The state now updates this adoption to include the modeling guidelines and PM

10

 increments specified in the June 3, 1993, 

Federal Register

 document and changes in  52.21 which became effective June 3, 1994. 

2. In Iowa rule 23.3(2)d (3) and (4), the state previously allowed use of the Ringelmann Chart or an opacity determination
in regulating diesel-powered vehicles and locomotives. Since the state has adopted Test Method 9 for opacity as found
in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A (also in this April 20, 1994, adoption), the state hereby ceases to use the Ringelmann Chart.


3. In subrule 23.4(6), the state amends a typographical error in a rule concerning emissions of particulate matter
in sand handling and surface finishing operations in metal processing. The rule itself is unchanged. 

4. In subrule 25.1(9), the state previously outlined its test methods and procedures by adopting those specified
in 40 CFR part 60, appendices B and F through February 11, 1991. The state now updates its adoption to include appendix
A of part 60 and include amendments through May 17, 1993. This adoption includes Test Method 9 for opacity as outlined
in 2. above. 




EPA Action 



EPA is taking final action to approve revisions submitted May 15, 1994, for the state of Iowa. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds 

(Union Electric Co.

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A

., 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). 

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted these actions from review under Executive Order 12866. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 21, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)


The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in the 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. 

If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent rule
based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any
parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans and 
Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; 
Redesignation of the Huntington West Virginia Ozone Nonattainment 
Area to Attainment and Approval of the Area's Maintenance Plan 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a redesignation request and a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of
West Virginia. This SIP revision approves a maintenance plan for the Huntington area including contingency measures
which provide for continued attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The intended
effect of this action is to approve a redesignation request of the area from moderate ozone nonattainment to ozone
attainment and to approve a maintenance plan for the area. This action will also remove any sanctions imposed on the
Huntington area under section 179 of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act). This action is being taken in accordance
with the Clean Air Act (CAA). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 6, 1994 (59 FR 46019), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of West Virginia.
The NPR proposed approval of the maintenance plan and redesignated the Huntington area to attainment for ozone. The
formal request for redesignating the Huntington moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment and the maintenance
plan SIP revision were submitted to EPA by the State of West Virginia on November 12, 1992. On February 22, 1994 and August
10, 1994 West Virginia provided clarifying revisions to its maintenance plan. 
The maintenance plan for the Huntington area provides for emissions 
tracking, triggers to implement contingency measures, and a schedule for implementing the measures. In the event
that exceedances of the ozone NAAQS are measured such that nonattainment is indicated at any of the three monitors
in the Huntington-Ashland area or in the event that periodic emissions inventory updates or major permitting 
activity reveals that excessive or unanticipated growth in 
ozone precursor emissions has occurred or will occur, West Virginia 
will accordingly select and adopt additional control measures. 



The specific requirements for the redesignation and maintenance plan and the rationale for EPA's proposed action
are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. Two letters supporting the redesignation and maintenance plan
were received, and one adverse comment letter was received on the NPR. Following are the comments that were submitted
relevant to EPA's action to redesignate the Huntington area and to approve the maintenance plan. EPA responses follow
each comment. 




Comment 

#



1: 

The Commonwealth of Kentucky supports the request to redesignate the West Virginia portion of the Huntington-Ashland
moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment. In conjunction with Kentucky's request to redesignate the Kentucky
portion of the Huntington-Ashland moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment, West Virginia's maintenance
plan and contingency measures meet the U.S. EPA's criteria and guidance to ensure that the air quality in this area
will be preserved. 



Response 

#



1: 

EPA acknowledges this comment. 



Comment 

#



2: 

Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) wishes to strongly support the proposed redesignation to ozone
attainment of the Huntington, West Virginia area (Wayne and Cabell Counties). In view of the fact that there have been
no violations of the ozone standard in the Huntington area since the 1989 ozone season, it is appropriate for this redesignation
to be approved. The maintenance and contingency plans should assure continued attainment will be maintained. 



Response 

#



2: 

EPA acknowledges this comment. 



Comment 

#



3: 

The Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition (OVEC) commented that contingency measures of the maintenance plan are
not adequate to assure attainment since the exact causes of ozone nonattainment in this area are not well understood.





Response 

#



3: 

As stated in the NPR, EPA believes that the criteria of sections 107(d)(3)(E)(iii) and 175A have been met by the Huntington
area. The Huntington area has not recorded an ozone violation in the last five years. During this period, permanent
and enforceable reductions in ozone precursors occurred. As part of their maintenance plan, West Virginia will carefully
track precursor emissions. If for any reason, a substantial increase in emissions occurs or if ozone violations are
recorded, the contingency measures in the maintenance plan allow the State to choose the most appropriate measure(s)
to deal with the situation. The combination of emissions tracking and available contingency measures will allow
the State to mitigate future problems should they occur. 



Comment 

#



4: 

OVEC also commented that the first two measures of the contingency plan which include extending the VOC/RACT requirement
to sources previously excluded and requiring more stringent controls and/or emissions offsets for new sources should
be implemented immediately. 




Response 

#



4: 

The Huntington area has not had any ozone violations for five years. Permanent and enforceable reductions in ozone
precursor emissions have occurred, and negative growth is expected in the area. This information indicates that
the area will continue to maintain the ozone standard in the future, and that the contingency measures do not need to
be implemented at this time. 




Comment 

#



5: 

OVEC also commented that NO

X



 emissions estimates in the area appear to be low, and more study is needed to determine if additional NO

X



 RACT requirements would help reduce ozone. 


Response 

#



5: 

The NO

X

 emission estimates for the Huntington area were determined through the application of current EPA emission inventory
guidance. Therefore, these emission estimates are considered by EPA to accurately represent NO

X 

emissions for the area. If substantial increases in emissions of NO

X

 

were to occur, the appropriate contingency measure(s) would be used to reduce the emissions of this ozone precursor.

Comment 

#

6: OVEC also commented that the emission caps to be set for existing plants as described as contingency measures should
be set now, including a cap for the largest stationary source which is in Kentucky. 


Response 

#

6: West Virginia has time to determine how caps would be set, when and if it were necessary to choose this contingency
measure. West Virginia cannot set emission caps for sources in Kentucky. Detailed information about the maintenance
plan for Kentucky's portion of the ozone nonattainment area will appear in the separate notice prepared by EPA Region
IV. 


Comment 

#

7: OVEC commented that the contingency measures related to Stage II and vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M)
programs do not address the main stationary sources of ozone precursors. These programs are costly and would not be
productive. 


Response 

#

7: For the past five years, Huntington has not experienced violations of the ozone standard due to reductions in mobile
emissions. While current predictions do not indicate future increases in mobile emissions, contingency measures
such as Stage II and I/M could provide a cost effective means of offsetting potential emissions increases from mobile
and/or stationary source growth. 


Comment 

#

8: OVEC commented that until all causes of the ozone problem are understood in detail, no contingency plan is adequate.



Response 

#

8: As previously mentioned, the Huntington area has not had a violation of the ozone standard in five years. Permanent
and enforceable reductions have occurred, and future predictions indicate that emissions from all source categories
will remain below emissions for these sources in the base attainment year of 1993. Therefore it is unlikely that ozone
problems will occur again. However, in order to maintain attainment, the state will carefully track and periodically
update the emissions inventory for the area. If substantial growth of emissions occurs or if ozone violations are
recorded, the contingency measures will be examined and an appropriate measure(s) will be implemented. Since emissions
of both VOC and NO

X

 are being tracked and the list of contingency measures covers both precursor pollutants and a variety of source categories,
the state can determine which sources need to be controlled and which measures need to be implemented. 




Final Action 





EPA is approving the ozone maintenance plan for the Huntington (Cabell and Wayne counties) area of West Virginia submitted
on November 12, 1992, as revised on February 22, 1994 and August 10, 1994 because it meets the requirements of Section
175A. In addition, the Agency is redesignating the Huntington area to ozone attainment because the Agency has determined
that the provisions of Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act for redesignation have been met. 

Because it was a nonattainment area on January 15, 1993 EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a
finding that West Virginia had failed to submit either a full or committal SIP revision for a basic inspection and maintenance
(I/M) program for the Huntington portion of the ozone nonattainment area. Similarly on January 18, 1994, EPA notified
the Governor that West Virginia had failed to submit a 15% plan for the area. These findings commenced the sanctions
process outlined by section 179 of the Act. The 2:1 offset sanction has been in effect in the Huntington area since September
6, 1994 as a result of the January 15, 1993 finding. Upon the effective date of this final approval by EPA of West Virginia's
redesignation request and maintenance plan, the requirement for West Virginia to submit a basic I/M program and 15%
plan for this area will be lifted. Upon that same effective date, both findings will be automatically rescinded in
the Huntington area and any sanctions imposed as of that date will be lifted. 


Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action to approve West Virginia's
redesignation request and maintenance plan for the Huntington portion of the Huntington-Ashland ozone nonattainment
area must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 21, 1995. Filing a petition
for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes

Acrylic Acid-Stearyl Methacrylate Copolymer; Tolerance Exemption 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylic acid-stearyl
methacrylate copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 27756-15-6) when used as an inert ingredient (emulsifier, suspending agent,
or rheology modifier) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, raw agricultural commodities after harvest,
or animals. B.F. Goodrich Co. petitioned for this regulation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of November 2, 1994 (59 FR 54872), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the B.F. Goodrich Co., 3925 Embassy
Parkway, Akron, OH 44313-1799, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4298 to EPA requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend
40 CFR part 180 by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylic acid-stearyl
methacrylate copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 27756-15-6) when used as an inert ingredient (emulsifier, suspending agent,
or rheology modifier) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, or to raw agricultural commodities after
harvest, or to animals. 


Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemptions will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemptions are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule implements section 204(b)(4) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, as amended by the Labor/Health
and Human Services FY 1993 Appropriations Act, Public Law 102-394, and the Labor/Health and Human Services
FY 1995 Appropriations Act, Public Law 103-333. Section 204(b)(4) provides that SLIAG grant funds unexpended
as of December 30, 1994, be reallocated to States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs, to the extent to which funds
are available. The reallocated funds will be available to States for reimbursement of SLIAG-related costs through
July 31, 1995.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background



State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants (SLIAG) are mandated by the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)
(Pub. L. 99-603), as amended. The purpose of SLIAG is to lessen the financial impact on State and local governments
that resulted from the legalization of certain previously illegal aliens under IRCA. The SLIAG program provides
reimbursement to States for the costs of certain public assistance, public health, and education services they have
provided to these eligible legalized aliens through September 30, 1994.

The Labor/Health and Human Services FY 1993 Appropriations Act, Public Law 102-394, dated October 6, 1992,
amended section 204(b)(4) of IRCA to provide that any funds not expended as of December 30 1994, be reallocated to participating
States which have expended their entire allotments and which have incurred unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs. The
basis for the reallocation is each State's percentage share of total unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs in all States
with such costs.

In order to implement the amendment, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking on May 31, 1994. We received
nine comments from two commenters on the proposed rule. Our response to these comments is set forth below.

In addition, we have revised the final rule to make it consistent with the amendment to IRCA in the Labor/Health and
Human Services FY 1995 Appropriations Act, Public Law 103-333. The amendment provides that States use reallocated
funds to reimburse accepted SLIAG-related costs within 90 days of the award of the funds but no later than July 31, 1995.
This change to the final rule is also discussed below.



Section 402.2, Definitions



The amendment to IRCA requires that unexpended funds from SLIAG grants be reallocated to States with unreimbursed
SLIAG-related costs. In the final rule, ``unexpended funds'' is defined as the amount by which a State's allotments
through FY 1994 exceed the State's SLIAG-related costs as of December 30, 1994.



Comment (Definition of ``Unexpended Funds'')



One commenter suggested that the definition of unexpended funds should be revised to mean the amount by which a State's
allotments exceed the amount of the State's drawdowns from its allotments as of December 30, 1994. The commenter suggested
that States' drawdowns may be higher than their accepted SLIAG-related costs and that the definition of unexpended
funds in the proposed rule would be unworkable unless the rule were further amended to require States to repay amounts
by which drawdowns exceed accepted costs. The commenter also noted that States can appeal any order for repayment
of funds and that an appeal can be time-consuming.



Response



We have chosen to use SLIAG-related costs rather than drawdowns in calculating unexpended funds for the following
reasons. First, the current SLIAG regulation at  402.20 provides that Department rules at 45 CFR part 92 apply
to grants awarded under the SLIAG program. Part 92 requires that grantees refund to the Department any unobligated
grant funds after the end of the funding period (45 CFR 92.50(d)(2)). Grantees are further required to liquidate obligations
of grant funds no later than 90 days following the end of the funding period of a grant (45 CFR 92.23(b)). We believe that
the regulation does therefore already meet one concern of the commenter, since it requires that States refund the
amounts by which their drawdowns from their allotments exceed their SLIAG-related costs. In the case of SLIAG grants,
refund of unobligated amounts is required after the due date of the final cost reports on December 29, 1994.

<TEXT>
 

Second, if we had chosen to use drawdowns rather than SLIAG-related costs to determine unexpended funds, the total
amount of unexpended funds might be lower than if we use SLIAG-related costs. The commenter, for instance, suggests
that States' drawdowns may be higher than their accepted SLIAG-related costs. If a State with drawdowns higher than
its accepted SLIAG-related costs were, in its final cost report, unable to document the additional costs for which
it was claiming reimbursement, the State would be required to refund the amount of the excess drawdown. If we were to
use the definition proposed by the commenter, we would be precluded from including that amount (i.e., the amount of
the excess drawdown) in the total of unexpended funds. We believe that using accepted SLIAG-related costs instead
of drawdowns will ensure that the maximum amount of unexpended funds is available for reallocation.

The commenter also suggests that drawdowns rather than SLIAG-related costs be used in determining unexpended funds
because States with drawdowns greater than accepted SLIAG-related costs can appeal an order for repayment and such
an appeal can be time-consuming. In the final rule, we have allowed 90 days for States to submit their final cost reports;
we have allowed an additional 76 days for States to respond to our comments on their final cost reports and to submit
revisions. In view of the amount of time we have allowed in the final rule to States to submit their final cost reports
and to submit revised reports, if necessary, we believe that the likelihood of any appeal is slight. Although an appeal
would reduce the unexpended funds available for reallocation as of March 15, 1995, we believe that the total amount
of unexpended funds available for reallocation will be greater using SLIAG-related costs, rather than drawdowns,
as the basis for determining unexpended funds.

Finally, although some States may have drawdowns which exceed their accepted SLIAG-related costs as of December
30, 1994, other States have chosen, during the course of the SLIAG program, to draw down funds only after SLIAG-related
costs have been accepted by the Department. We believe that the definition proposed by the commenter might unfairly
penalize States which have chosen to draw down funds after acceptance by the Department of their SLIAG-related costs.
In particular, use of this commenter's suggested definition might require us to take back and reallocate to other
States funds granted to such States which exceed their drawdowns but are less than their accepted SLIAG-related costs,
leaving these States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs. To avoid creating a new group of States with SLIAG-related
costs for which they would not receive reimbursement, we have not incorporated the suggestion of this commenter in
the final rule.



Section 402.11, Limitations on Use of SLIAG Funds



In the SLIAG regulation, States are required to document and report to the Department the SLIAG-related costs they
have incurred in providing services to eligible legalized aliens through September 30, 1994. The cost reports are
due 90 days after the end of the final year. The final cost reports for grants awarded under   402.31 and
402.33 are therefore due December 29, 1994. In the final rule,  402.11 has been amended to provide that, for States
to receive reimbursement from SLIAG funds, costs submitted by States must be accepted by the Department as allowable
by March 15, 1995.



Comment (Limitations on Use of SLIAG Funds)



One commenter suggested that the requirement that SLIAG funds be available for reimbursement only for SLIAG-related
costs accepted as allowable by the Department as of March 15, 1995, be deleted. The commenter suggested that this requirement
would be unfair to local governments which cannot report SLIAG-related costs directly to the Department nor respond
directly to comments. The commenter also noted that the proposed rule provided no mechanism for appealing decisions
by the Department not to accept costs while under the existing regulation, States can appeal disallowances before
repaying funds.



Response



In the proposed rule, we established the deadline of March 15, 1995, for accepting SLIAG-related costs for two reasons.
We believe that this date provides as long a period of time as possible for States to respond to our comments on their
final cost reports and to submit revised cost reports while ensuring that there is adequate time for the Department
to complete the reallocation process and for States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs to draw down reallocated
funds by July 31, 1995. Specifically, we are allowing 76 days between the due date of the final cost reports on December
29, 1994, and the final date for acceptance by the Department of SLIAG-related costs on March 15, 1995, to States for
revisions of their costs reports.

Although the commenter expressed concern about the impact of the deadline of March 15, 1995, on local governments,
we believe that this deadline does allow adequate time for States (the grantees under the SLIAG program) to document,
review, submit, and revise their SLIAG-related costs, incurred by both State and local governments, Furthermore,
we have no reason to believe that any extension of the March 15, 1995, deadline would necessarily ensure that local
governments would be able to work out with State grantees problems with the cost submissions of the local governments.
We have retained the deadline of March 15, 1995, in the final rule as we believe it provides sufficient time both for
States to report their SLIAG-related costs and for States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs to draw down their
reallocated funds.

Finally, the commenter notes that the proposed rule provides no mechanism for appealing decisions by the Department
not to accept costs after March 15, 1995. In developing the parameters for reallocating unexpended funds to States
with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs, we were concerned with ensuring that the reallocation of unexpended funds
and the drawdown of the reallotted funds by States would be completed by the statutory deadline. In order to ensure
that the reallocation takes place in a timely manner, we have established the date of March 15, 1995, as the final date
on which SLIAG-related costs will be accepted by the Department prior to the reallocation of unexpended funds. We
have not included in the final rule any mechanism for revisiting the Department's decision not to consider in its reallocation
determinations any costs which have not been submitted to the Department by March 15, 1995. However, with respect
to costs which a State has submitted by March 15, 1995, but which have not been accepted by the Department,  402.25
of the regulation permits such a State to appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board an order requiring the State to repay
amounts disallowed.

The Labor/Health and Human Services FY 1995 Appropriations Act, Public Law 103-333, amended 204(b)(4) of IRCA
to provide that States use reallocated funds to reimburse SLIAG-related costs within 90 days of the award of the reallotted
funds but no later than July 31, 1995. We have therefore revised  402.11(q) to incorporate this provision. States
are reimbursed for their SLIAG-related costs when they draw down funds from their allotments. This provision applies
also to a State's reimbursing other governmental entities within the State for SLIAG-related costs they have incurred.
These costs must have been submitted by the State in annual cost reports by December 29, 1994, and accepted by the Department
by March 15, 1995.



Section 402.26, Time Period for Obligation and Expenditure of Grant Funds



This section of the rule stated that any obligations of grant funds by a State must be expended within the time limit
set by 45 CFR 92.23(b). It also stated that this deadline could be extended by the Secretary at the request of a State.
We proposed to revise this section by establishing the deadline for expending obligations as December 29, 1994, and
by deleting the provision allowing a State to request an extension of this deadline. We noted in the preamble of the
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that we were proposing this revision to ensure that we would be able to determine the
amount of unexpended funds as of December 30, 1994, as mandated by the amendment to IRCA.



Comment



We received two comments on this section of the proposed rule. The first commenter suggested a revision to specify
that only obligations from grant funds awarded under   402.31 and 402.33 must be liquidated by December
29, 1994, and that grant funds awarded under  402.34 be available for obligation and expenditure through June
30, 1995. The second commenter suggested that the section be revised to allow obligations incurred through September
30, 1994, to be expended through June 30, 1995, with funds awarded under  402.34.



Response



With regard to the first comment, it was not our intent in our proposed wording of this provision to limit what States
could do with funds received under  402.34. The provision to which the commenter refers; i.e., that obligations
be expended by December 29, 1994, was intended, as noted above, to provide a basis for determining the total amount
of unexpended funds from grants awarded under   402.31 and 402.33 as of December 30, 1994, as required
by the amendment to IRCA. 

Since the purpose of the reallocation of unexpended funds is to reimburse States for costs incurred prior to October
1, 1994, we do not believe that the time limit of 45 CFR 92.23(b) is applicable to the reallotted funds. In response to
this comment and to clarify our intent in this provision, we are revising the wording of the first sentence of  402.26(b)
to specify that the time limit for liquidating obligations pertains only to funds awarded under  402.31 and
 402.33. We are further revising  402.26(b) to state explicitly that the time limit of 45 CFR 92.23(b)
does not apply to funds awarded under  402.34.

As noted above, we also have revised the final rule to be consistent with the amendment to IRCA made by the FY 1995 Labor/Health
and Human Services Appropriations Act, Public Law 103-333. Section 402.11(q) provides that States use reallocated
funds to reimburse SLIAG-related costs within 90 days of the award of the funds but no later than July 31, 1995.

Finally, we have revised  402.51 to indicate that no reporting on obligations or expenditures is required for
funds allotted under  402.34.

The second commenter suggested that States be allowed to liquidate obligations incurred before October 1, 1994,
through the statutory deadline with funds allocated under  402.34. From the beginning of the SLIAG program,
the regulation has defined SLIAG-related cost as an expenditure by a State or local government. Costs incurred by
private providers and State obligations with private providers have, therefore, not been accepted as SLIAG-related
costs for reimbursement. This definition of SLIAG-related costs incorporates IRCA's goal of reimbursing State
and local governments for their costs resulting from the legalization of certain aliens. It also has ensured that
allocations of SLIAG funds are based on actual costs incurred by States and that allocations have not been influenced
by States' obligating large amounts of funds. In view of this existing definition, obligations incurred by States
prior to October 1, 1994, but not expended by December 29, 1994, cannot be considered SLIAG-related costs acceptable
for reimbursement with reallocated funds. This suggestion has therefore not been incorporated in the final rule.



Section 402.30, Basis of awards; Section 402.40, General



The final rule in  402.30 states that no application is necessary for receiving reallocated funds; reallocated
funds will be awarded to States whose annual cost reports show that their accepted SLIAG-related costs exceed their
allotments under   402.31 and 402.33. Section 402.40 provides that, to be eligible for reallocated funds,
States must submit annual reports which document that their SLIAG-related costs exceed the amount of their allotments
under   402.31 and 402.33.



Comment



One commenter suggested that both of these sections be revised. According to this commenter,  402.30 should
be revised to state that reallocated funds would be awarded to States which have drawn down the full amount of their
allotments as of December 30, 1994. The commenter also suggested that  402.40 be revised to provide that, to
be eligible for reallocated funds, States must have drawn down their entire allotments as of December 30, 1994.



Response



As we noted above, we believe that the best way to meet the goal of the amendment to IRCA is to define unexpended funds
as the difference between a State's allotments through FY 1994 and the State's SLIAG-related costs. The final rule
therefore incorporates this definition. For this reason, we believe that the basis of eligibility and the basis of
awards should also be based on a State's SLIAG-related costs, rather than on drawdowns. The final rule therefore states
that reallocated funds will be awarded to States whose annual cost reports show that their accepted SLIAG-related
costs exceed their allotments under  402.31 and  402.33. It also states that, to be eligible for reallocated
funds, States must submit annual reports which document that their SLIAG-related costs exceed the amount of their
allotments under  402.31 and  402.33.



Section 402.34 Allocation of unexpended funds



This section provides that unexpended funds will be reallocated based on the percentage share of unreimbursed SLIAG-related
costs of each State with such costs to the total of all unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs. The section provides further
that the allotments awarded to States will be the amount of the reallocation or the amount of each State's unreimbursed
SLIAG-related costs, whichever is less.

Comment



We received comments from both commenters on this section. Both suggested that the reallocated amounts should be
each State's percentage share of the unexpended funds even if that amount exceeds the amount of a State's total unreimbursed
SLIAG-related costs. One commenter suggested that reallocating all unexpended funds would make it possible for
States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs as of December 30, 1994, to be reimbursed for any additional SLIAG-related
costs they might be able to identify, document, and submit to the Department after March 15, 1995.



Response



There are two reasons why we are not revising the rule in accordance with these suggestions. First, the purpose of funds
reallocated under this amendment to IRCA is to reimburse States for costs they incurred in providing services to eligible
legalized aliens prior to October 1, 1994. Under this final rule, States are allowed 90 days (until December 29, 1994)
to submit final reports documenting their SLIAG-related costs. They are allowed an additional 76 days (until March
15, 1995) to respond to comments and revise their submissions before the unexpended funds are reallocated. We believe
that the amount of time we are already providing to States is adequate to document and submit SLIAG-related costs incurred
prior to October 1, 1994.

Second, and more important, we believe that extending the period during which States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related
costs could continue to attempt to identify and document SLIAG-related costs would not be in accordance with the intent
of the amendment to IRCA. We believe that it was intended that all States participating in SLIAG would have the same
amount of time to identify, document, and submit SLIAG-related costs and that the purpose of the amendment was to provide
reimbursement to States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs only for those costs documented and submitted during
that equal period of time. Since extending the period of time for identifying additional costs for all States would
make it impossible to determine the total amount of unexpended funds for reallocation, we conclude that the intent
of the amendment was to provide reimbursement only for SLIAG-related costs submitted by participating States by
December 29, 1994. For these two reasons, we are not incorporating these suggestions in the final rule.

Section 402.51, Reporting




In this section, we revised the reporting requirements to provide for funds awarded under  402.34. Since all
SLIAG-related costs will have been submitted to, and accepted by, the Department by March 15, 1995, we attempted to
keep reporting as simple as possible by not requiring that States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs submit an
additional annual cost report after July 31, 1995.




Comment




One commenter suggested that the rule be revised to allow States to submit reports on their SLIAG-related costs by
September 28, 1995. The commenter suggested that this change would be necessary if the regulation were also revised
to allow States to continue to identify, document, and submit SLIAG-related costs for reimbursement until June 30,
1995.



Response



As we have noted above, we believe that the amount of time we have allowed in the regulation for documenting and submitting
SLIAG-related costs is both adequate and equitable. Since States will not be allowed to submit additional SLIAG-related
costs to the Department after March 15, 1995, we have not incorporated this suggestion in the final rule.



Effective Date



This rule is effective upon publication. While this rule would not normally be effective until 30 days after its publication,
we have found, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) that good cause exists for waiving the waiting period for this rule. Specifically,
we have determined that an immediate effective date is necessary to provide States with adequate notice of the procedures
which will be used to reallocate unexpended SLIAG funds as mandated by IRCA. If the effective date for this rule is delayed,
States may not have sufficient time to gather and submit to the Department the cost information which is integral to
the reallocation process. Accordingly, we have found that the usual 30 day waiting period is impracticable and unnecessary.




Regulatory Procedures



Executive Order 12866



Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with priorities and
principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including
not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome
while still achieving the regulatory objectives.



Paperwork Reduction Act




This rule imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements, and therefore, no approvals are necessary under
section 3504 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511).



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small entities.

The primary impact of this rule is on State governments. Therefore, we certify that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it affects the reallocation and reallotment of
SLIAG funds to State governments. Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

Changes to NASA FAR Supplement Cross-Waiver of Liability Clauses in NASA Contracts



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Procurement, Contract Management Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule is the regulatory basis for cross-waiver clauses to be included in contracts for NASA Space Shuttle
services, ELV launches, and Space Station activities. These clauses represent the required implementation of a
previously published final rule regarding NASA's policy of cross-waivers of liability in agreements for Space Shuttle
services, ELV launches, and Space Station activities. By incorporating these cross-waivers of liability clauses
in contracts for Space Shuttle services, ELV launches, and Space Station activities, NASA and the other parties agree
not to bring claims against each other for any damage to property or for injury or death of employees that occurs during
the time a cross-waiver is in effect. In addition, the clauses implement another requirement of the agreements which
is to flow down these cross-waivers to their related entities ensuring that a party, its contractors, and subcontractors,
waive their right to sue the other party, its contractors, and subcontractors for damages sustained in connection
with activities conducted under the agreements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



In September 1991, NASA published a final rule (14 CFR Part 1266) that established cross-waivers of liability as the
regulatory basis for cross-waiver provisions to be included in agreements for NASA Space Shuttle launch services,
space station activities, and ELV program launches. By developing broad, consistent cross-waivers, NASA established
a known regime of liability limitation to encourage space exploration and investment by reducing insurance costs
and the potential for litigation.

To be made fully effective, the cross-waivers needed to be incorporated into applicable NASA prime contracts as well
as subcontracts. This final rule establishes the regulatory basis for inclusion of these new cross-waivers in contracts
for Space Shuttle services, Space Station activities, and ELV program launches.

NASA published an interim rule (58 FR 54050) on October 20, 1993, amending the NASA FAR Supplement to provide for revised
cross-waivers of liability clauses for Space Shuttle services and Space Station activities and to provide for a new
cross-waiver of liability for Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launches. The existing cross-waiver clause for Space
Shuttle was revised and the ELV program launch cross-waiver clause was developed to be consistent with the cross-waiver
clause that had been in effect for space station activities, because it was becoming increasingly complex for users,
customers, contractors, and NASA to work under somewhat inconsistent cross-waivers of liability in agreements
for Space Station activities, ELV launches, and Shuttle launch services not related to Space Station.

Based upon a review of public comments on the interim rule, only minor changes needed to be made to NASA FAR Supplement
clause 1852.228-76, ``Cross-waiver of Liability for Space Station Activities,'' since it already contained
language corresponding with the provision in the original final rule regarding cross-waiver agreements. No changes
needed to be made to NASA FAR Supplement clauses 1852.228-72, ``Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Shuttle
Services,'' and 1852.228-78 ``Cross-Waiver of Liability for NASA Expendable Launch Vehicle Launches,''
but both these clauses are reprinted in this final rule in their entirety. 

For these reasons, NASA has adopted, for use in contracts for Space Shuttle services and ELV launches, the new cross-waiver
clauses set forth in this rule. Like the Space Station cross-waiver, the new Shuttle and ELV cross-waivers will apply
to all activities done in implementation of Shuttle and ELV contracts. However, when an activity that involves Shuttle
launch services or a NASA ELV launch is to be conducted under the Space Station program, the Space Station cross-waiver,
not the respective Shuttle or ELV cross-waiver, will be utilized in the agreement governing that activity.

NASA received thirteen comments in response to the Interim Rule. Several comments suggest that there may be some misunderstanding
about the nature and the purpose of the cross-waiver clauses. The cross-waiver clause is not the waiver between the
Government and the contractor but rather the fulfillment of NASA's obligation to flow down the cross-waiver in order
to bar claims by NASA contractors against parties or users with whom NASA has entered into agreements for services.
The language in 1828.371(a) clarifies this intent. The language in paragraph (a) of the clauses also states the purpose
and objective of the cross-waiver clauses. Several other comments suggest there may be some misunderstanding between
the nature of the cross-waivers and of indemnification under Public Law 85-804. When the Government provides
indemnification coverage to its contractor, the Government will hold a contractor harmless from third party liability,
as well as from damage or harm to Government and contractor employees and property, as a result of exposure to unusually
hazardous risks. Indemnification represents a relationship between the Government and its contractor. A cross-waiver
does not provide indemnification protection as it does not waive third party liability between the Government and
its contractors. When the Government flows down a cross-waiver of liability to its contractors, there is a waiver
of liability between the Parties involved in Protected Space Operations, not between the Government and its contractors
(recognizing that the cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is damaged
as a result of its involvement in Protected Space Operations). A cross-waiver represents a relationship between
Parties involved in Protected Space Operations as well as between the Parties' related entities involved in Protected
Space Operations. Therefore, claims between the Government and its contractor are not covered by the cross-waiver.
The cross-waiver clauses remain unchanged, since no modification is necessary to address coverage for indemnification-related
issues. Since indemnification is a separate issue from cross-waiver liability, no change is made to the cross-waiver
clauses stating that they must be inserted in a contract that contains indemnification coverage under Public Law
85-804. As stated in 1828.371, the appropriate cross-waiver clause is inserted in solicitations or contracts
of $100,000 or more when the work to be performed involves Protected Space Operations.

The remaining comments will be addressed individually as follows. One comment noted that the definition of ``Partner
State'' in clause 1852.228-76 includes signatories to the current Intergovernmental Agreement. This definition
fails to include Russia's or any other unforeseen future partner's involvement. For this reason, the definition
of ``Partner State'' in 48 CFR 1852.228-76(b)(3) has been changed to include any future signatories to the Intergovernmental
Agreement. A second comment states that the definition of ``Protected Space Operations'' in each clause differs
from the current 1852.228-72 clause which defines the end of the activity period in detail. The comment recommends
that the new clauses better define the end of Protected Space Operations. This Final Rule leaves the definition of
``Protected Space Operations'' unchanged. The definition as well as the scope of cross-waivers have been broadened
intentionally as set forth in the final rule for agreements in September 1991. There is no latitude to change this definition
in the flow down from agreements to contract clauses. The third comment recommended that the words ``or gross negligence''
be added after the words ``willful misconduct'' in (c)(4)(iii) of each clause. The rationale mentioned that omission
of the phrase ``gross negligence'' would raise a potential conflict between the clause and the laws of most states
which refuse to recognize advance agreements to waive liability based on gross negligence as being contrary to public
policy. The clauses remain unchanged, because it is U.S. Federal policy to waive all degrees of negligence when the
Federal Government is involved in space launch activities. A fourth comment stated the cross-waiver does not address
the situation in which one of the parties fails to obtain the waiver agreement. The clauses remain unchanged. There
is no requirement to state that the contractor's failure to flow down clauses does not obviate application of the substantive
aspects of the clause to that contractor. Another comment requested that paragraph (b)(3), the definition of ``Party,''
clarify that the U.S. Government agency signing the agreement is signing on behalf of the United States and all its
related entities. While the clauses remain unchanged, clarification of this point may be necessary. The U.S. Government
agency signing the agreement is definitely signing on behalf of the United States and all its related entities.

2. Section 1828.001 is removed.

3. Section 1828.371 is revised to read as follows:



1828.371 

Clauses for cross-waivers of liability for Space Shuttle services, Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launches, and
Space Station activities.



(a) In agreements covering Space Shuttle services, certain ELV launches, Space Station activities, NASA and other
signatories (the Parties) agree not to bring claims against each other for any damage to property or for injury or death
of employees that occurs during the time such a cross-waiver is in effect. These agreements involving NASA and other
Parties include, but are not limited to, Memoranda of Understanding with foreign governments, Launch Services Agreements,
and other agreements for the use of NASA facilities. These agreements require the Parties to flow down the cross-waiver
provisions to their related entities so that contractors, subcontractors, customers, and other users of each Party
also waive their right to bring claims against other Parties and their similarly related entities for damages arising
out of activities conducted under the agreements. The purpose of the clauses prescribed in this section is to flow
down the cross-waivers to NASA contractors and subcontractors.

(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause 1852.228-72, Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Shuttle
Services, in solicitations and contracts of $100,000 or more when the work to be performed involves ``Protected Space
Operations'' (applicable to the Space Shuttle) as that term is defined in the clause. If Space Shuttle services under
the contract are being conducted in support of the Space Station program, the contracting officer shall insert the
clause prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section and designate application of that clause to those particular activities.

(c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-78, Cross-Waiver of Liability for NASA Expendable
Launch Vehicle (ELV) Launches, in solicitations and contracts of $100,000 or more for the acquisition of ELV launch
services when the service is being acquired by NASA pursuant to an agreement described in paragraph (a) of this section.
If, under a contract that covers multiple launches, only some of the launches are for payloads provided pursuant to
agreements, an additional clause shall be inserted in the contract to designate the particular launches to which
this clause applies. If a payload is being launched by use of an ELV in support of the Space Station program, the contracting
officer shall insert the clause prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section and designate application of that particular
launch.

(d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-76, Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Station
Activities, in solicitations and contracts of $100,000 or more when the work is to be performed involves ``Protected
Space Operations'' (relating to the Space Station) as that term is defined in the clause.

(e) At the contracting officer's discretion, the clauses prescribed by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section
may be used in solicitations, contracts, new work modifications, or extensions, to existing contracts under $100,000
involving Space Shuttle activities, ELV launch services, or Space Station activities, respectively, in appropriate
circumstances. Examples of such circumstances are when the value of contractor property on a Government installation
used in performance of the contract is significant, or when it is likely that the contractor or subcontractor will
have its valuable property exposed to risk or damage caused by other participants in the Space Shuttle services, ELV
launches, or Space Station activities.



PART 1852_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES

(a) As prescribed by regulation (14 CFR part 1266), NASA agreements involving Space Shuttle flights are required
to contain broad cross-waivers of liability among the parties and the parties related entities to encourage participation
in space exploration, use, and investment. The purpose of this clause is to extend this cross-waiver requirement
to Contractors and related entities under their contracts. This cross-waiver of liability shall be broadly construed
to achieve the objective of encouraging participation in space activities.

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule makes final an interim rule published on May 3, 1994. The May 3, 1994 interim rule amended HUD's section 8 regulations
for newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated housing projects to provide for the system of occupancy preferences
in certain section 8 assisted housing 
authorized by subtitle D of title VI of the Housing and Community Development 
Act of 1992. Subtitle D allows owners of section 8 projects originally 
designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families to provide preferences to 
elderly families in selecting tenants for available units in those projects. 
Owners that elect to provide preferences to elderly families as authorized by 
subtitle D also must reserve no less than a statutorily determined number of 
units for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly families. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



On May 3, 1994 (59 FR 22916), HUD published an interim rule that adopted 
the system of occupancy preferences authorized by Subtitle D (sections 651-
661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 
102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (``HCD Act of 1992''). Subtitle D, entitled 
``Authority to Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents and Units for Disabled 
Residents
 in Certain Section 8 Assisted Housing'' and codified at 42 U.S.C. 
13611-13620, allows an owner of a covered section 8 housing project to elect 
to provide preferences to elderly families in selecting tenants for available 
units in the project, subject to certain statutory requirements. An owner who 
makes this election also must reserve a percentage of units, not to be less 
than the percentage determined according to a formula set out in the statute, 
for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly.

The preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule provided a detailed summary 
of the provisions of subtitle D, and readers are referred to the May 3, 1994 
interim rule for a more complete discussion of the provisions of subtitle D. 
The following, however, provides a review of which section 8 housing projects 
are covered by subtitle D, and therefore eligible for the election of 
occupancy preferences authorized by subtitle D. 



Eligibility to Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents 



Section 651 of the HCD Act of 1992 provides in relevant part, 
``[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner of a 

covered section 8 housing project designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, 

may in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available for 
occupancy, give preference to elderly families who have applied for occupancy 
in the housing * * *.'' (Emphasis added.) 

With regard to the phrase ``designed primarily for occupancy by elderly 
families,'' HUD believes that in using the term ``primarily,'' the Congress 
intended to limit the applicability of subtitle D to either the section 8 
units in those covered projects in which a majority of the section 8 units 
were designed for elderly families (i.e., seniors
), or to the section 8 
units in covered projects where a distinct portion of the project (e.g., a 
tower or a wing of a project, but not just a floor) exists in which the 
majority of section 8 units were restricted to seniors only. Thus, section 
651 may apply to the section 8 units in an entire project originally designed 
primarily for occupancy by elderly families (``covered section 8 housing 
project''), or section 651 may apply to the section 8 units in a portion of 
such project, but only where the section 8 units in this project or portion of 
the project were designed primarily for seniors. The preamble, at times, uses 
the term ``covered section 8 units'' to recognize that there are partially 
assisted projects whose section 8 units will be covered by this rule. 
Additionally, the term ``non-elderly disabled families'' is used to refer to 
disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly families.





HUD points out that the statutory system of preferences authorized by 
subtitle D is only available to projects which qualify as ``covered section 8 
housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families.'' HUD 
emphasizes that many projects that have section 8 assistance are not ``covered 
section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly 
families'' (as discussed in the following section), and may not elect the 
subtitle D statutory system of preferences. 



Covered Section 8 Housing Project: Section 659 



Subtitle D and this final rule (and the May 3, 1994 interim rule) define 
``covered section 8 housing'' to mean housing that: 

(1) Was constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant to 
assistance provided under section 8(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 
1937 (1937 Act), as in effect before October 1, 1983; 

(2) Is assisted under a contract for assistance under such section; and 

(3) Was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly 
families. 



1. Projects that are Newly Constructed or Substantially Rehabilitated 
Pursuant to Assistance Provided Under Section 8(b)(2) of the 1937 Act, as in 
Effect Before October 1, 1983 



HUD administers six section 8 programs that involve newly constructed or 
substantially rehabilitated housing. However, the system of preferences under 
subtitle D does not apply to all these programs. 

The programs to which subtitle D applies are: 

(1) The Section 8 New Construction Program, 24 CFR part 880; 

(2) The Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation Program, 24 CFR part 881; 

(3) The State Housing Agencies program (insofar as it involves new 
construction and substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 883; 

(4) The New Construction Set-Aside for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing 
Projects Program, 24 CFR part 884; and 

(5) The Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of 
HUD-Owned Projects (insofar as it involves substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR 
part 886.






Other programs which may involve section 8 new construction or 
substantial rehabilitation assistance, but which are 

not 

covered by the 
preferences in subtitle D are identified in section 658 of the HCD Act of 
1992. Under section 658 of the HCD Act of 1992, an owner of a project (or 
portion of a project) that was originally designed for occupancy by elderly 
families, and assisted under the Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate 
(BMIR) program, the Section 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction 
Payment for Rental Projects program, or the Section 202 Loans for Housing for 
the Elderly or Handicapped Program, may continue to restrict occupancy in such 
projects (or portion of such projects) to elderly families in accordance with 
the rules, standards and agreements in effect when the housing project was 
developed. Accordingly, under this rule, the subtitle D statutory system of 
preferences does not apply to newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated 
section 8 projects with HUD insurance or assistance under any of these three 
programs.
 HUD emphasizes that it is critical that a project owner 
understand the type of assistance a project receives to determine eligibility 
under subtitle D and these regulations.

Project owners should note that the following types of projects or 
assistance would 

NOT

 be covered by this rule: 




_Section 202 housing projects, 

_Section 221(d)(3) BMIR housing projects, 

_Section 221(d)(4) retirement service centers (because such 
projects have FHA mortgage insurance but no section 8 assistance), 

_Section 236 housing projects, 

_Housing projects with contracts for section 8 loan management set 
aside (unless the projects also have contracts for section 8 assistance 
involving new construction or substantial rehabilitation, in which case only 
those units could be covered), 

_Housing projects with project-based section 8 rental certificates, 
and 

_Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs (rental vouchers and 
certificates). 



2. Assisted Under a Contract for Assistance Under Section 8(b)(2) 



Some newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated projects have 
unassisted units and assisted units. These projects are often referred to as 
``partially assisted projects.'' Because the statutory definition of ``covered 
section 8 housing'' only applies to housing that is under a contract for 
assistance, the subtitle D system of preferences would 

not

 apply to unassisted units in a partially assisted project. Additionally, nothing in this regulation establishes
a cap on the number of unassisted units for disabled families in a partially assisted project. 

While this regulation does not apply to the unassisted units in a 
partially assisted project, this regulation also does not relieve any owner of 
any project, including the owner of a partially assisted project, from 
complying with the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the implementing regulations for these statutes, 
or any other applicable statutory or regulatory requirement, including the 
requirements of the National Housing Act, with respect to the assisted or 
unassisted units. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, owners may provide 
the preferences in accordance with this rule, with respect to the assisted 
units. 



3. Originally Designed Primarily for Occupancy by Elderly Families 



The final statutory requirement for qualification as a ``covered section 
8 housing project'' is that the project must have been 

originally designed for 
occupancy by elderly families. 

The statute does not define the term 
``originally'' or define the phrase ``originally designed for occupancy by 
elderly families.'' However, the House Report offers some insight on this 
subject. The House Report suggests that to qualify as housing originally 
designed for occupancy by elderly families, the owner of the project must have 
expressed an intent to create housing for elderly tenants when the developer 
negotiated with the Department for Federal financial assistance. (H.R. Rept. 
No. 760, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. at 141 (1992).) 

Because the various types of housing projects covered by this rule were 
developed under several different programs, and over a period of time which 
spans almost two decades, there is no uniform documentation at HUD which 
evidences the population group to be served by a project. In many instances, 
the application in response to a notice of funding availability (NOFA) shows 
that a project was designed as an elderly housing project. However, an 
indication of the population group to be served by the housing project does 
not always appear in any one document. 

In addition, because one of the previous definitions of ``elderly 
families'' in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act included disabled families, it is 
not always clear from documents that indicate a project was developed for 
``elderly families'' whether the project for elderly families was intended to 
mean housing for the broader eligible category of families (i.e., elderly 
families 

and

 disabled families) or for families who qualified by virtue of age 
alone. Further confusion may be added by the fact that for most of the period 
when this housing was being developed, HUD policy required all housing for the 
elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to 
design a certain percentage of the units to be accessible for persons with 
physical disabilities. Typically, these units were made available to eligible 
families with physical disabilities, regardless of age. 

Thus, in establishing whether a project was originally designed 
primarily for occupancy by elderly families within the meaning of subtitle D, 
two distinctions must be drawn: (1) the project was designed primarily for 
elderly families (as opposed to non-elderly families); and (2) the project was 
designed for elderly families (i.e., seniors), and not designed for elderly 
families under the broader meaning of this term, which formerly included 
elderly families and disabled families. 



II. Final Rule_Adoption of Interim Rule With Only Clarifying Changes 



As discussed in the May 3, 1994 interim rule, subtitle D is very 
prescriptive in establishing how the system of occupancy preferences is to 
operate (see 59 FR 22921-22922). Subtitle D establishes which section 8 
housing projects are eligible for the election of preferences provided by 
subtitle D. Subtitle D establishes that the ``elderly families'' eligible to 
reside in covered section 8 housing projects for which the owner has made the 
election of preferences provided by subtitle D are those families who meet the 
definition of ``elderly families'' as set forth in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, 
as amended by section 621 of the HCD Act of 1992. Subtitle D establishes the 
formula by which an owner will determine the number of units in the covered 
section 8 housing project that must be reserved for occupancy by disabled 
families who are not elderly or near-elderly. Subtitle D establishes the 
secondary system of preferences available to owners if there are insufficient 
numbers of elderly families and disabled families who are not elderly or near-
elderly to occupy all the units reserved for such. Subtitle D also 
establishes the procedures to be followed if units remain vacant after the 
owner has elected to provide the secondary system of preferences, and the 
procedures to be followed concerning the order of selection within groups to 
whom a preference has been given. Given the statutory framework of the system 
of preferences for elderly families authorized by subtitle D, most of the 
provisions of the May 3, 1994 interim rule flow directly from the statute. 

One provision in the May 3, 1994 interim rule that was not addressed by 
statute and added by regulation concerns the type of documentation that would 
support an owner's claim that the owner's project was originally designed 
primarily for occupancy by elderly families. In the May 3, 1994 interim rule, 
HUD noted that with the exception of possible further changes to this 
provision (to add additional types of documentation that should be included in 
the list) and possible clarifying changes, public comment would not alter the 
provisions of the interim rule because of the prescriptive nature of the 
subtitle D. 

This final rule adopts the May 3, 1994 interim rule with eight 
clarifying changes, which are as follows: 

1. The final rule clarifies that the election of elderly preference by 
an owner of a covered section 8 housing project can be made at any time. (See 
 880.612a(a)(1)(i), and comparable sections in other parts covered by this 
rule.) 

2. The final rule codifies the guidance provided in the preamble to the 
May 3, 1994 interim rule that states that where an election of an elderly 
preference would have an adverse effect on non-elderly families on the waiting 
list, the owner is required to notify those families of the new policy (i.e., 
the subtitle D system of preferences) and how this policy may affect them. 
(See new  880.612a(a)(1)(iii), and comparable sections in other parts covered 
by this rule.) 

3. The final rule also codifies the preamble guidance that otherwise 
qualified families for a section 8 housing project, such as disabled families, 
near-elderly disabled families and families with children, who are on the 
waiting list for the project, cannot be removed from the list because of the 
owner's election of an elderly preference. (See new  880.612a(a)(1)(iv), and 
comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.)

4. The final rule clarifies that an owner who makes the elderly 
preference election must be able to produce, if challenged, all relevant 
documentation in the owner's possession that pertains to the original design 
of the project, not only the evidence that was ``supporting evidence'' as the 
language read in the interim rule. (See  880.612a(a)(2)(i) and comparable 
sections in other parts covered by this rule.) 
5. The final rule clarifies that the primary source list in the rule is 
not limited to underwriting or financial documents. (See  800.612(a)(b)(1)(i) 
and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.) 
6. The final rule clarifies that in discussing project unit mix with a 
higher percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units, higher percentage means 
more than fifty percent. (See  880.612a(b)(1)(ii) and comparable sections in 
other parts covered by this rule.) 
7. The final rule clarifies that the requirement to make vacant units 
available to otherwise eligible families if there are an insufficient number 
of families qualifying for the elderly preference or for the reserved units 
for non-elderly disabled families (or qualifying for the near-elderly disabled 
family secondary preference if adopted) applies to owners of covered projects 
who make the elderly preference election, and not solely to owners who elect 
the elderly preference and elect also the secondary preference as the May 3, 
1994 interim rule indicated. 
8. The final rule clarifies that projects under National Housing Act 
programs and receiving section 8 assistance may be subject to preferences in 
addition to those contained in the section 8 regulations. (See  880.612a(g) 
and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.) 
With the exception of these eight changes, the final rule remains the 
same as the May 3, 1994 interim rule. 
The following section of the preamble provides a summary of the issues 
raised by the public commenters, and HUD's response to these issues. Although 
only six commenters commented upon the May 3, 1994 interim rule (also referred 
to as the subtitle D rule) by the end of the public comment period on July 5, 
1994, the six commenters raised a number of issues. 


III. Discussion of Public Comments 




Comment. 

One commenter stated that interim rulemaking was inappropriate 
for the subject matter addressed by subtitle D, and HUD should have solicited 
advance public comment before issuing the subtitle D rule for effect. 


Response. 

As noted earlier in this preamble, and discussed in more 
detail in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule (59 FR 22921-22922), 
very little in HUD's subtitle D rule would be altered by public comment 
because the system of occupancy preferences established by subtitle D allows 
HUD little discretion to expand or depart from this system by regulation. 
Therefore advance public comment would not have been practicable or necessary. 
Additionally, as noted in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule, 
HUD, in issuing the subtitle D rule, had the benefit of public comment 
received on the rule that implemented subtitle B of title VI of the HCD Act of 
1992 (59 FR 22921-22922). Subtitle B provides public housing agencies (PHAs) 
with the option, subject to certain requirements, to designate public housing 
projects, or portions of these projects, for occupancy by elderly families, 
disabled families or elderly families and disabled families. HUD's final rule 
implementing subtitle B was published on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17652). To the 
extent that the subtitle D rule which concerns section 8 housing, and the 
subtitle B rule which concerns public housing, address similar issues, the 
public comments on the subtitle B rule were taken into consideration in 
development of the May 3, 1994 interim rule. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that given the recent publication of the 
notice revising HUD's Occupancy Handbook for multifamily projects, and the 
May 3, 1994 interim rule, project owners are confused about their obligations 
and responsibilities to persons with disabilities, and further clarification 
is needed. 


Response. 

The notice of the revision to Chapter 2 of HUD Handbook on 
Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs, which was 
published on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21992) advised that Chapter 2, as revised, 
would remain in effect pending issuance regulations for subtitle D, at which 
time further revisions to Chapter 2 would be issued. Those revisions are now 
in preparation. Chapter 2 remains in effect to the extent that it is not 
contradicted by the interim rule, and until such time as the next revision to 
this chapter is issued. The Department also intends to issue further guidance 
on subtitle D and the issue of mixed populations in the form of technical 
assistance materials. 


Comment. 

One commenter expressed concern that HUD has not issued its 
rule that would revise the terms ``families'' and ``elderly person,'' among 
others, in HUD's section 8 regulations to reflect the changes made to these 
terms by section 621 of the HCD Act of 1992. 


Response. 

The definitions of these terms in section 621 of the HCD Act 
of 1992 are applicable without issuance of a HUD regulation. On April 10, 
1992 (57 FR 12686), before enactment of the HCD Act of 1992, HUD published a 
proposed rule that would revise, among other things, the definition of 
``family'' in parts 812 and 912 to reflect changes made to this definition by 
the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (Pub.L. 101-625, approved November 
28, 1990). Rather than issue separate rulemaking to revise the definitions in 
parts 812 and 912 to reflect the changes made to certain definitions (e.g., 
``elderly person,'' ``person with disabilities'') by the HCD Act of 1992, HUD 
determined to make these changes at the time of issuance of the final rule for 
the April 10, 1992 proposed rule. HUD anticipates publication of this final 
rule by December 1994. Again, however, the definition changes made by the HCD 
Act of 1992 are currently applicable despite the absence of a final rule that 
amends parts 812 and 912 to reflect these definition changes.

Comment. 

Two commenters requested that the final rule on subtitle D 
require approval by HUD before an owner may make the election of occupancy 
preferences authorized by subtitle D. The commenters stated that HUD approval 
of an owner's election is the only effective and available means to ensure 
that an owner is not improperly applying the provisions of subtitle D to 
discriminate against persons with disabilities under the age of 62. The 
commenters stated that if HUD declined to adopt this suggestion, then, at the 
least, the final rule should require owners to report to HUD the election of 
an elderly preference. 


Response. 

HUD believes that to require an owner to seek approval by HUD 
before making the election of occupancy preferences authorized by subtitle D 
is without statutory support and is not consistent with Congressional intent. 
As discussed earlier in this preamble, subtitle B of title VI of the 
1992 HCD Act provides PHAs with the option to designate a public housing 
project or portion of a project for occupancy by elderly families, disabled 
families, or elderly families and disabled families. Subtitle B further 
provides that before one of these three designations can be made, a PHA must 
obtain the approval of HUD through the submission of an allocation plan. 
Accordingly, for subtitle B housing, Congress explicitly requires prior HUD 
approval. There is no comparable provision, however, in subtitle D. HUD does 
not believe that this was an oversight on the part of the Congress, but 
reflects clear Congressional intent that the election of occupancy preferences 
under subtitle B (``designation'' as it is referred to in subtitle B) would 
require prior HUD approval, and the election of preferences under subtitle D 
would not. 
With respect to reporting the election of preference by the owner, HUD 
has determined that this reporting requirement is not necessary. The 
applicable Section 8 regulations provide for periodic reviews of section 8 
housing projects to determine contract compliance. The regulations in parts 
880, 881 and 883 require annual reviews by the contract administrator (see 
  880.612 and 881.612, 883.713), and the regulations in parts 884 and 886 
require review by HUD at such intervals as deemed necessary to ensure that the 
owner is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract. At 
the time of this review, the contract administrator or HUD, as the case may 
be, will identify those owners who have made an election of occupancy 
preference under subtitle D. HUD will revise its form that is used in 
management reviews to include identification of those projects which have 
elected the elderly preference authorized by subtitle D. Additionally, in 
reviewing occupancy procedures, the contract administrator will consider the 
operation of the title VI occupancy preferences along with other occupancy 
procedures. Finally, HUD's review of an owner's decision to provide 
preferences may also arise in connection with HUD civil rights complaint 
investigations under the Fair Housing Act, or compliance reviews and complaint 
investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as 
amended, or other applicable civil rights statutes. 


Comment. 

One commenter requested that the final rule exempt accessible 
units from the covered section 8 units subject to the elderly preference. The 
commenter stated that at the very least these units should be rented only to 
those persons with disabilities who are near-elderly and elderly and who need 
the accessibility features of particular units. 


Response. 

There is no basis in subtitle D for HUD to exempt accessible 
units from covered section 8 units subject to the elderly preference, nor is 
there a need for HUD to do so. In accordance with section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations 
in 24 CFR part 8, as well as the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 

et seq

.) and 
HUD's implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 100, reasonable accommodations 
must be made for the needs of persons with disabilities who need an accessible 
unit. The housing provider is to accommodate the person either by (1) making 
an available inaccessible unit accessible (so long as doing so would not 
result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or activity or 
undue financial and administrative burdens), or (2) by transferring a tenant 
who is living in an accessible unit but does not need an accessible unit to 
the inaccessible unit, and offering the accessible unit to the disabled family 
(24 CFR 8.27). However, as discussed in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 
interim rule, an owner who has made the election of occupancy preference 
authorized by subtitle D and who is selecting tenants from the waiting list, 
can (where it is an elderly family's turn for admission because the reserve 
requirement, if any, has been met) give an elderly family who needs an 
accessible unit a preference over a non-elderly disabled family who also needs 
the accessible unit. Once the reserve requirement, if any, for disabled 
families has been met, the owner can also give the accessible unit to an 
elderly family who does not need the accessibility features of the unit even 
if a non-elderly disabled family has also applied for the unit. HUD points 
out that once the reserve requirement, if any, for disabled families has been 
met, the owner can give the unit to an elderly family who does not need the 
accessibility features of the unit only if there is no elderly family who 
needs the accessibility features of the unit. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the final rule should ``grandfather-
in'' all non-elderly persons with disabilities on the project waiting lists as 
of June 2, 1994, the effective date of the interim rule, and prohibit a 
project owner from passing over these persons when selecting tenants from the 
waiting lists. 


Response. 

The statute provides no authority for HUD to adopt this 
provision; to the contrary, by its plain language, the statute authorizes the 
immediate implementation of the preferences and the set aside. Existing 
residents are protected in the event that current occupancy of non-elderly 
families with disabilities exceeds the percentage of units under the set 
aside. As noted later in this preamble, however, owners of covered section 8 
projects who make the election are prohibited from removing non-elderly 
persons with disabilities from the projects' waiting lists.

Comment. 

Two commenters objected to any reliance on secondary sources 
to support an owner's claim that the owner's project is a covered section 8 
housing project. The commenters stated that secondary sources, which reflect 
actions taken by owners after they obtained HUD financial assistance, will do 
nothing to illuminate the project's original intent and should not be 
utilized. The commenters suggested that acceptable documents should include 
only legally binding documents submitted to HUD at the time of negotiations 
for Federal financial assistance. The commenters also strongly objected to 
the inclusion of ``any other historical data'' on the basis that this broad 
category of documentation would allow owners to circumvent the intended 
project eligibility requirements of subtitle D. 


Response. 

HUD declines to drop secondary sources as acceptable sources 
of documentation. HUD carefully considered which documents may evidence 
project eligibility for the subtitle D system of preferences, and determined 
that it was important to include secondary sources as acceptable 
documentation. As discussed in the May 3, 1994 interim rule, because of the 
various types of housing projects covered by subtitle D and because these 
housing projects were developed under several different programs and over a 
period of time which spans almost two decades, there is no uniform 
documentation at HUD which identifies the population group to be served by the 
project. Further, difficulty in identifying the population group to be served 
is added by the fact that the previous definition of ``elderly families'' in the 
1937 Act included disabled families, and HUD's policy required all housing for 
the elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to 
design a certain percentage of units to be accessible for persons with 
physical disabilities. The difficulty in identifying the population group to 
be served is compounded by the fact that there often was no specific 
identification of projects as elderly (i.e., seniors) and standard program 
documents generally did not identify projects as elderly or, if they did so, 
did not distinguish between projects designed primarily for seniors, or for 
persons with disabilities, or for both. Given these difficulties, HUD 
determined that it was important not to limit the type of evidence that would 
lend support to an owner's claim that the owner's project was originally 
designed primarily for elderly families (seniors). Accordingly, the final 
rule provides, as did the interim rule, that if the primary sources do not 
provide clear evidence of the original design of the project, then original 
design may be established through secondary sources, of which there must be at 
least 

two

 secondary sources, establishing the identity of the project as 
elderly (seniors) housing. Additionally, secondary sources become important 
where primary sources conflict. Where primary sources conflict, then original 
design may be established through secondary sources. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the use of project unit mix with a 
higher percentage of efficiency and one bedroom units as a secondary source 
makes no sense. The commenter stated that the size of the units is therefore 
wholly irrelevant to the original character of the property. Another 
commenter stated that if considered as a secondary source, project unit mix 
data must be applied uniformly, and HUD must develop and publish project 
configuration standards. 


Response. 

HUD disagrees that project unit mix is totally irrelevant. 
As stated in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule ((59 FR 22918) and 
in the text of the regulation itself, a project unit mix with a higher 
percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units may be particularly relevant in 
distinguishing elderly projects under the previous definition of elderly 
persons (in which disabled families were included in the definition of 
``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects. Project unit mix, in 
combination with other factors such as the number of accessible units, may be 
useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the former 
broader definition of ``elderly families'' which included disabled families. 
(See 59 FR 22918 and  880.612a(b)(1)(ii) and comparable sections in other 
parts covered by this rule.) HUD points out that, as a secondary source, 
project unit mix alone is not sufficient to establish the original character 
of the project. The project owner must be able to produce another secondary 
source to support that the project was originally designed primarily for 
occupancy by seniors. 
With respect to establishing uniform project unit mix standards, HUD 
relies on the language of the statute itself. In describing projects covered 
by subtitle D, the statute uses the term ``primarily designed for occupancy by 
elderly families'' which HUD has defined as having at least a 

majority

 of the 
units designed for elderly families. In the preamble to the May 3, 1994 
interim rule, HUD stated: 



The Department believes that in using the term `primarily,' the 
Congress intended to limit the applicability of subtitle D to 
either the section 8 units in those covered projects in which a 


majority 

of the section 8 units were designed for elderly families 
(i.e., seniors), or to the section 8 units in covered projects 
where a distinct portion of the project (e.g., a tower or a wing 
of a project, but not just a floor) exists in which the 

majority

 
of section 8 units were restricted to seniors only. Thus, section 
651 may apply to the section 8 units in an entire project 
originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families 
(``covered section 8 housing project''), or section 651 may apply to 
the section 8 units in a portion of such project, but only where 
the section 8 units in this project or portion of the project were 
designed primarily for seniors. (Emphasis added.) (59 FR 22916)

 

To be consistent with this interpretation that ``primarily'' means at 
least a majority of the units, the rule has been revised to state ``project 
unit mix with more than fifty percent of the units which are efficiency or 
one-bedroom units.'' 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that because there will be cases where 
neither the primary nor secondary sources establish original design and intent 
or where the project owner cannot produce original documentation, other 
evidence should be considered than that listed in the interim rule. The 
commenter suggested that the final rule provide that if a covered project is 
eligible for exemption from the familial status provisions of the Fair Housing 
Act because it constitutes housing for older persons it is also exempt under 
subtitle D. The commenter also suggested that if the project owner has had a 
fair housing complaint filed against the owner by a non-elderly disabled 
person on the basis of the person's eligibility to reside in the project that 
this indicate's management's belief that the project was built to serve 
seniors.

Response. 

HUD clearly rejects the latter suggestion. Coverage of a 
section 8 housing project under subtitle D must be based on evidence that the 
project was originally designed primarily for seniors, not solely on the 
owner's ``belief'' that it was designed primarily for seniors. HUD also 
declines to adopt the commenter's first suggestion. While some ``housing for 
older persons,'' as this term is defined in 24 CFR part 100, subpart E, could 
also constitute section 8 housing that is covered by subtitle D, some would 
not. 
HUD emphasizes that the list of primary and secondary documents are not 
intended to be all inclusive, but rather provide examples of the types of 
documents that would be acceptable. The language of the rule itself expresses 
that intent by referring in both cases to ``sources 

such as

'' (emphasis added) 
before listing the examples. (See  880.612a(b)(1) (i) and (ii) and comparable 
sections in other parts covered by this rule.) 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that documents that indicate approval of a project's final proposal frequently spell out the
intended nature of a 
project, yet these documents may not qualify ``as any other underwriting or 
financial document collected at or before loan closing.'' 


Response. 

As noted in the response to the preceding comment, the list of sources does not exclude other sources such as a ``final
proposal'' approved by HUD. To avoid any implication that the source list is limited to 
underwriting or financial documents, the word ``other'' has been removed from 
this section (e.g., see  880.612a(b)(1)(i) and comparable sections in other 
parts covered by this rule). 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the language of the interim rule 
indicates that there could be five primary sources that demonstrate a 
project's eligibility and one which indicates otherwise in which case the 
owner would be required to turn to secondary sources to establish a project's 
eligibility. The commenter states that requiring an owner to look to 
secondary sources, which are inferior to primary sources, when a majority of 
sources indicate that the project was designed primarily for occupancy by 
elderly families does not make sense. 


Response. 

HUD agrees with the commenter that requiring an owner to look at secondary sources when a majority of primary sources
``demonstrate'' the original design of the project does not make sense, but disagrees that the 
rule indicates that this is the course of action that an owner would have to 
follow. The critical language in the rule is ``clear evidence'' of original 
design. The rule states that ``In any case where the primary sources do not 
provide 

clear evidence 

of original design of the project for occupancy 
primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary documents 
conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the 
project was originally designed.'' (Emphasis added.) (See 24 CFR 
880.612a(b)(2) and comparable provisions in other parts covered by this rule.) 
Establishing original design, therefore, is not simply a matter of 
where the numbers fall; that is, establishing original design is not a matter 
of counting how many documents favor a project originally designed for seniors 
and how many documents oppose such design. The focus is to be on the type of 
evidence located and how clearly the evidence may address the issue of 
original design. If one primary source clearly (unambiguously) establishes 
original design of a seniors project, and one or more other primary sources do 
not specifically address the original design of the project and are ambiguous, 
the owner need not look to secondary sources to establish a project's 
eligibility. In this case, the owner may rely on the single primary source 
that establishes clear evidence of a project originally designed for seniors. 
Conversely, the single primary source may clearly establish that the project 
was not originally designed for seniors. Again, however, where the primary 
sources conflict (i.e., are equally ambiguous or equally specific), the owner 
must go to secondary sources. An example of a document that clearly specifies 
the project's original design could be the market studies projecting occupancy 
by seniors on which underwriting decisions were made. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the documentation concerning the 
project's identity must take into account the definitions of ``elderly family'' and ``elderly person'' as this term
has been used over the past several years to include ``persons with disabilities.'' The commenter stated that ``documents
using the words `elderly person' or `elderly family' must be viewed as evidence of an intent to serve people 62 years
of age and older and people with disabilities.'' 


Response. 

HUD disagrees with the commenter, and addressed this issue in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule. (59 FR 22917-22918)
Because one of the previous definitions of ``elderly families'' in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act included disabled
families, it is not clear from documents that indicate a project was developed for ``elderly families'' whether the
project for elderly families was intended to mean housing for the broader eligible category of elderly families (i.e.,
elderly families and disabled families) or housing for families who qualified by virtue of age alone. Thus a document's
statement that the project is a project for elderly families, in and of itself, would not constitute clear evidence
which category of family was to be served, i.e., the broader category of elderly family or the family who qualified
by age alone. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the final rule must explicitly 
require owners to make available for inspection by applicants, tenants and 
their advocates, all relevant documents regarding elderly-only designation, 
including any conflicting documents. 


Response. 

The interim rule provided that the owner, if challenged on 
the issue of eligibility of the project for the election, ``must be able to 
support the project's eligibility through the production of supporting 
evidence.'' (See  880.612a(a)(2)(i) and comparable sections in other parts 
covered by this rule.) HUD has revised this language in the final rule to 
provide that the owner, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the 
project for the election, must be able to support the project's eligibility 
through the production of all relevant documentation in the owner's possession 
that pertains to the original design of the project. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the final rule must explicitly allow individual States to decide the question of how State
law will regulate a permissive election of elderly selection preferences because subtitle D 
permits the election ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' The 
commenter suggested that the following language be included in the rule: 
``Nothing in this rule is intended to limit any State or local law that affords disabled families greater access than
the minimum required by this section to projects eligible for the preference provided by this section, nor is it intended
to relieve an owner of fair housing obligations imposed by State or local law.'' 


Response. 

The ``notwithstanding any other provision of law'' language of subtitle D (see first sentence of sections 651 and
652 of subtitle D; 42 U.S.C. 13611 and 13612) is not intended, as indicated by the commenter, to restrict or limit implementation
of the elderly preference as authorized by 
subtitle D by requiring an owner to ensure that implementation of the 
subtitle D preferences is not inconsistent with other statutes and regulations 
that may address the issue of the degree of access to covered section 8 
housing by non-elderly persons with disabilities. The ``notwithstanding any 
other provision of law'' is intended to do just the opposite, which is to allow an owner of a covered section 8 project
to implement the subtitle D 
preferences and reservation of units in the manner authorized by subtitle D 
without concern whether other laws may provide for a different implementation 
of an elderly preference, or a greater percentage of units to be reserved for 
non-elderly disabled persons. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the final rule must make clear that a zero reservation of units for disabled families is unacceptable.
Two 
commenters objected to the statement in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 
interim rule that if a covered project did not have any disabled families 
residing in the project on the two dates specified in the statute, the owner 
would not be required to reserve any units for disabled families. 


Response. 

Subtitle D clearly allows for zero reservation of units. The statute does not impose a minimum percentage of units
to be reserved for nonelderly disabled families, and the subtitle D rule reflects this statutory 
scheme. Subtitle D (section 652(b) of the HCD Act of 1992) provides as 
follows: 
(b) 

Number of Units

_Each owner required to reserve units in a 
project for occupancy under subsection (a) shall reserve a number 
of units in the project that is not less than the lesser of_
(1) the number of units equivalent to the higher of_
(A) the percentage of units in the project that were occupied by such disabled families upon the date of enactment of
this Act; or 
(B) the percentage of units in the project that 
were occupied by such families upon January 1, 1992; 
or 
(2) 10 percent of the number of units in the project.

The Congress could have required the minimum number to be ``not less than 
the 

greater of'' 

as opposed to ``not less than the 

lesser of,'' 

which would have 
ensured a minimum of 10 percent of the number of units in a covered project to 
be reserved for non-elderly disabled families. Alternatively, the Congress 
could have drafted the statute to provide that in the event the number of 
units occupied by disabled families on the two dates in paragraph (b)(1) 
[cited above] equaled zero, the minimum percentage of units to be reserved for 
non-elderly disabled families would be 10 percent or such other percentage as 
the Congress may have desired to impose. The Congress took neither of these 
courses of action, and without these or similar provisions, there is no 
question that the calculation in paragraph (b) could result in zero 
reservation of units. However, as stated in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 
interim rule, HUD believes that few, if any, covered section 8 housing 
projects will fall into the category of having no disabled families occupying 
units in the project on the date of enactment of the HCD Act of 1992 or 
January 1, 1992. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the replacement of the term 
``mobility impaired'' with the term ``tenants needing the accessibility features 
of the unit'' represents a significant change. The commenter stated that this 
term departs from the language of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973 and HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 8 which use the term ``individuals 
with physical handicaps.'' The commenter stated that this substitution of 
terms will make accessible units available to any disabled person who can 
establish a need for the accessible features of a unit regardless of whether 
or not the individual has a physical disability. 


Response. 

As an initial matter, HUD points out that the term ``tenants 
needing the accessibility features of the unit'' is not used in the subtitle D 
rule, but was used in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule. (See 59 FR 
22920). Secondly, HUD notes that while the term ``mobility impaired'' does 
appear in HUD's part 8 regulations (see 24 CFR 8.22(b)) issued in June 1988, 
it is now recognized that this term does not adequately reflect the broad 
range of disabilities which may cause an individual with a disability to need 
a unit with accessible features. The term ``mobility impaired'' was too often 
perceived as synonymous with the term ``persons in wheelchairs'' and did not 
appropriately reflect persons with other types of disabilities who may need 
accessible features of a unit. The term ``tenants needing the accessibility 
features of the unit'' used in the May 3, 1994 interim rule is not inconsistent 
with the language in HUD's section 504 regulations in 24 CFR part 8. The part 
8 regulations also use the term ``applicant or occupant having [disabilities] 
requiring the accessibility features of a unit.'' (See, e.g., 24 CFR 8.27). 
However, to have been more clear as to the types of tenants who may need the 
accessibility features of a unit, the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule 
should have used the term ``tenants with a disability that makes the 
accessibility features of the unit necessary.'' 
With respect to the commenter's concern that a project owner may 
indiscriminately assign accessible units to tenants, HUD notes that its 
section 504 regulations require owners to take reasonable nondiscriminatory 
steps to maximize the utilization of such units by eligible individuals whose 
disability requires the accessibility features of the particular unit. 
Additionally, as stated earlier in this preamble, where an accessible unit is 
not available to a person with disabilities who needs an accessible unit, the 
housing provider is to accommodate the person either by (1) making the unit 
accessible (so long as doing so would not result in a fundamental alteration 
in the nature of the program or activity or undue financial and administrative 
burdens), or (2) by transferring a tenant who is living in an accessible unit 
but does not need an accessible unit to the inaccessible unit, and offering 
the accessible unit to the disabled family. Given these requirements, it is 
unlikely that owners will not make every effort to maximize the utilization of 
accessible units by families who need the accessibility features of the unit. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the interim rule failed to 
acknowledge that subtitle D requires owners who elect an elderly preference to 
open admissions to all section 8 eligible families without regard to age or 
disability when there are vacant units in the project and an insufficient 
number of elderly families to fill those vacant units. Another commenter made 
a similar comment in stating that the final rule must clarify that an owner 
who does not elect to provide a secondary preference may admit any other 
eligible person if there is an insufficient number of applicants on the 
waiting list to fill either the elderly units or the units reserved for non-elderly disabled families. 


Response. 

HUD acknowledges that although the May 3, 1994 interim rule 
touches upon this issue, the language of the rule is not as clear on this 
point as it could or should be. The May 3, 1994 interim rule provides: ``If 
the owner of an elderly project who has elected to adopt the secondary 
preferences in paragraph (d) of this section determines, in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of 
families for whom the preference, including secondary preference, in occupancy 
has been given, to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project, 

the owner shall make the vacant units generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without
regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section.'' 

(Emphasis added.) (See  880.612a(e) and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.) HUD recognizes
that this paragraph indicates that the open admission requirement when there are vacant units is only applicable
to owners who elected to adopt the secondary preferences.

This section has been revised to clarify how an owner shall make vacant 
units in an elderly project if the owner has adopted the secondary preferences 
and there are an insufficient number of preferences, or if the owner has not 
adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of 
preferences. 


Comment. 

One commenter requested that the rule provide not only for 
HUD's right to review at any time the accuracy of the owner's identification 
of a project as an elderly project, but an owner's implementation of the 
system of preferences authorized by subtitle D. 


Response. 

There is no need for the rule to include a provision 
addressing HUD's right to review an owner's implementation of the system of 
preferences authorized by subtitle D. An owner' implementation of the system 
of occupancy preferences is subject to HUD's ongoing monitoring activities of 
covered projects, as well as civil rights complaint investigations and 
compliance reviews. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the final rule must address the 
issue of whether a tenant who was a non-elderly disabled person upon admission 
to a covered section 8 project may still be counted as non-elderly disabled 
when that person reaches the age of 50. The commenter stated that any tenant 
who is counted for the purpose of determining whether a project is meeting its 
required set-aside of units for non-elderly tenants who are disabled should 
continue to be counted for such purpose as long as the tenant continues to 
reside in the project notwithstanding the fact that the tenant reaches the age 
of 50. 


Response. 

HUD disagrees with the commenter. As discussed in an earlier 
response, the statute allows for the possibility of zero reservation of units. 
However, where there is a required reservation of units (which HUD anticipates 
will be the case in the majority of covered section 8 projects), HUD believes 
that the Congress intended for project owners to maintain the required 
percentage of units for non-elderly disabled persons. When a non-elderly 
disabled person reaches the age of 50, this person's unit can no longer be 
counted as part of the required percentage of units reserved for non-elderly 
disabled families. The preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule addressed 
this issue in part when it stated: ``In calculating actual utilization of units 
reserved for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, units 
occupied by elderly families where a member of the family is disabled do not 
count as part of the required percentage'' (59 FR 22920). 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the preamble to the May 3, 1994 
interim rule imposes an important responsibility on owners, that did not 
appear in the text of the regulation. That responsibility is to give notice 
to families on the waiting list adversely affected by the elderly preference. 
(See 59 FR 22921.) The commenter urged that this preamble language be 
included in the text of the regulation. 


Response. 

The commenter is correct. In the preamble to the May 3, 1994 
interim rule, HUD stated as follows:

 

[W]hen an owner's decision to provide preferences to elderly 
families under subtitle D would have an adverse effect on non-elderly families on the waiting list, the owner would
be required 
to notify those families of the new policy and how this policy may 
affect them. The notification requirement would be triggered if 
the current percentage of disabled families who are neither 
elderly nor near-elderly exceeds the minimum required percentage, 
and non-elderly families on the waiting list (including those with 
disabilities) may be passed over for covered section 8 units for 
the elderly, or if the project is one of the few which will have 
no units set aside for such disabled families under subtitle D.

 

HUD had intended to include this notification requirement in the May 3, 1994 
interim rule, and its omission was inadvertent. This requirement appears in 
this final rule with one change. (See new  880.612a(a)(1)(iii) and comparable 
sections in other parts covered by this rule.) The final rule provides that 
notification is triggered if the percentage of disabled families who are 
neither elderly nor near-elderly ``equals or exceeds'' the minimum required 
percentage. 


The purpose of requiring this notice is to alert non-elderly families on 
the waiting list where the owner's election of the preference scheme would 
possibly have an ``adverse effect'' on them. Once the percentage of non-elderly 
disabled families in occupancy ``is equal to'' the required percentage 
determined under subtitle D, non-elderly families may be passed over for 
covered section 8 units, unless, of course, the next unit to become vacant is 
a unit occupied by a non-elderly family. 


Comment. 

One commenter stated that the preamble to the May 3, 1994 
interim rule makes the point that owners are not allowed to use the interim 
rule to remove applicants from the waiting list, and that this point should be 
included in the text of the regulations. 


Response. 

HUD agrees with the commenter, and as noted earlier in this 
preamble has added a new paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to the rule which makes this 
point. (See new  880.612a(a)(1)(iv) and comparable sections in other parts 
covered by this rule.) 
Other Comments for Clarifying Changes or Editorial Corrections. Several 
other comments requested adoption of preamble language in the rule for clarity 
purposes or recommended editorial changes to certain of the regulatory 
provisions. 


Response. 

The significant clarifying changes have been individually 
addressed in this section of the preamble. With respect to other comments 
requesting clarifying changes, HUD determined that these requests for changes 
did not address significant issues that needed to be addressed individually in 
this preamble. In many cases, HUD determined that the clarification was not 
needed because the May 3, 1994 interim rule clearly and adequately addressed 
the issue or other HUD regulations addressed the issue of concern expressed by 
the commenter. An example of the former situation is one commenter's request 
that the subtitle D rule state that the subtitle D preferences do not apply to 
unassisted units. Since the rule clearly states that the subtitle D 
preference system applies to assisted, vacant units, HUD determined that there 
was no need to adopt the language suggested by the commenter. A few comments 
concerning clarification involved commenters requests to provide examples of 
application of subtitle D to certain circumstances. This, however, is the 
type of guidance best addressed by a handbook or other technical assistance 
materials, which HUD is now preparing.

IV. Other Matters 


Executive Order 12866


This final rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory
Planning and Review. Any changes made in this final rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket
file, which is available for public inspection in the Office of the Department's Rule's Docket Clerk, Room 10276,
451 Seventh St. SW, Washington, DC. 


Environmental Impact


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24
CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, at the time of development
of the interim rule. This finding remains applicable to this final rule and is available for public inspection during
regular business hours in the Office of General Counsel, the Rules Docket Clerk room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW,
Washington, DC 20410. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this final rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the final rule is directed to owners
of multifamily housing projects, and will not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal Government and State
and local governments. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. 


Executive Order 12606, The Family


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
final rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being
within the meaning of the order. This final rule implements the system of preferences authorized by subtitle D of title
VI of the 1992 HCD Act, which provides that owners of certain section 8 covered projects that were originally designed
primarily for occupancy by elderly families (i.e., families whose heads, spouses or sole members are 62 years or older)
may elect to give preference in occupancy to vacant units in the project to elderly families. Although subtitle D provides
for preferences for elderly families in projects meeting the conditions established by subtitle D, subtitle D also
requires that owners of such projects must reserve no less then a minimum number of units in these projects for disabled
families who are not elderly or near-elderly. The minimum number is determined in accordance with the formula established
by statute. 
Since the subtitle D preference system provides a primary preference for elderly families, and a secondary preference
for disabled families who are near-elderly, there is the possibility that this statutory system of preferences would
limit the availability of certain section 8 housing for (1) disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly
(if an owner gives preference to elderly families for units), and (2) such families with children, and thus adversely
impact the maintenance and well-being of these families. (Although owners can apply the same preferences and reservation
of units to families with children as to families without children, owners cannot restrict admission to any units
because of familial status as long as the family qualifies for the unit on the basis of the relevant age or disability
criterion for admission.) The Department believes that the number of projects that would be eligible for the preferences
provided by subtitle D is limited, and thus, the impact on family maintenance and well being would not be significant
within the meaning of the order. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
final rule, and in so doing certifies that this final rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This final rule reflects a system of occupancy preferences authorized by statute which
applies to section 8 newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing without regard to the size of entities
involved.


Regulatory Agenda


This rule was listed as sequence number 1803 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on November
14, 1994 (59 FR 57632, 57657) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

2. Section 880.612a is revised to read as follows: 


 880.612a 


Preference for occupancy by elderly families. 


(a) 

Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families. 
(1) Election by owners of eligible projects. 

(i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed
primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an ``eligible project'') may, at any time, elect to give preference
to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of
this section. 
(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the
owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an ``elderly project.''
``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.

(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to
notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect
them if: 
(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly
(hereafter, collectively referred to as ``non-elderly disabled families'') is equal to or exceeds the minimum required
percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and
therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over
for covered section 8 units; or 
(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set
aside for non-elderly disabled families. 
(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove
an applicant from the project's waiting list on the basis of having made the election. 
(2) 

HUD approval of election not required. 

(i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for
occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility
of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility
through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original
design of the project. 
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the
identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing
monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through
3619), or compliance reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29
U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes. 
(b) 

Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by elderly families.

 (1) 

Evidence supporting project eligibility.

 Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy
by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section,
shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section,
or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section: 
(i) 

Primary sources.

 Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary
source such as: The application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding
availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid
invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing;


or
(ii) Secondary sources.

 Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are
available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member
is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded
by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency
on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly
relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families
were included in the definition of ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with
other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those
serving the broader definition of ``elderly families'' which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant
type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence. 
(2) 

Sources in conflict. 

If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would
base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election
of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where
primary sources do not provide 

clear evidence 

of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary
sources conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.

(c) 

Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families. 

The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1)
of this section for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families.

<PARENT> FR941221-0-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) 

Minimum number of units to be reserved for non-elderly disabled families. 

The number of units in an elderly project required to be reserved for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families,
shall be, at a minimum, the lesser of: 
(i) The number of units equivalent to the higher of_
(A) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled
families on October 28, 1992; and 
(B) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled
families upon January 1, 1992; 

or 
(ii) 10 percent of the number of units assisted under this part in the eligible project. 
(2) Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families. 

The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families
than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly
disabled families will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families.
The number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that
number determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. 
(d) 

Secondary preferences. 

An owner of an elderly project also may elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions
of paragraph (d) of this section. 
(1) 

Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for elderly families.

 If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient
number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved
for elderly families (that is, all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as provided
in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for occupancy of such units to disabled families who
are near-elderly families. 
(2) 

Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for non-elderly disabled families. 

If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient
number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly
disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for occupancy of these
units to disabled families who are near-elderly families. 
(e) 

Availability of units to families without regard to preference.

 An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply
for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either: 
(1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly
preference, reserve preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant units; or 
(2) The owner has 

not 

adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference,
and reserve preference has been given to fill all the vacant units. 
(f) 

Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for preference.

 To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of applicants who qualify for the preferences, including
secondary preferences, provided by this section, the owner must: 
(1) Conduct marketing in accordance with  880.601(a) to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences
and reservation of units set forth in this section; and 
(2) Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the preferences provided in this section, including
taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families.

(g) 

Federal preferences

. An owner that gives preferences to elderly 
families and reserves units for non-elderly disabled families in accordance 
with this section also shall select applicants among each respective group in 
accordance with the Federal preferences contained in  880.613. Projects 
under National Housing Act programs and receiving section 8 assistance may be 
subject to preferences in addition to those contained in  880.613 which also 
must be applied in selecting applicants among each respective group. 
(h) 

Prohibition of evictions. 

An owner may not evict a tenant without 
good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part 
because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because 
of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 
through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 
(42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620). 


PART 881_SECTION 8 HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS PROGRAM FOR SUBSTANTIAL 
REHABILITATION 


3. The authority citation for 24 CFR part 881 continues to read as 
follows: 





Authority: 

42 U.S.C. 1437a, 1437c, 1437f, 3535(d), 12701, and 13611-13619. 




4. Section 881.612a is revised to read as follows: 


 881.612a 

Preference for occupancy by elderly families. 


(a) 

Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families. 
(1) Election by owners of eligible projects.

 (i) An owner of a 
project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that 
was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an 
``eligible project'') may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly 
families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, 
subject to the requirements of this section. 
(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the 
preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election 
to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an 
``elderly project.'' ``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of 
household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older. 
(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families 
in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting 
list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election 
may affect them if: 
(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the 
project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively 
referred to as ``non-elderly disabled families'') is equal to or exceeds the 
minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly 
families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be 
passed over for covered section 8 units; or 
(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled 
families. 
(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in 
accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's 
waiting list solely on the basis of having made the election. 
(2) 

HUD approval of election not required. 

(i) An owner is not 
required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the 
election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the 
project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be 
able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all 
relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the 
original design of the project. 
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make 
determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as 
an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result 
of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations 
under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance 
reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes. 
(b) 

Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by 
elderly families. 

(1) 

Evidence supporting project eligibility.

 Evidence that 
a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally 
designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore 
eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, 
shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed 
in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or at least two items from the sources 
(``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section: 
(i) 

Primary sources. 

Identification of the project (or portion of a 
project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary source 
such as: the application in response to the notice of funding availability; 
the terms of the notice of funding availability under which the application 
was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid 
invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial 
document collected at or before loan closing; 

or 
(ii) Secondary sources

. Two or more sources of evidence such as: 
lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are 
available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households 
where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence 
that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded 
by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or 
programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more 
than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source 
particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous 
section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the 
definition of ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects and which in 
combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be 
useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader 
definition of ``elderly families'' which includes disabled families]; or any 
other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other 
comparable evidence. 
(2) 

Sources in conflict

. If a primary source establishes a design 
contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would 
base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this 
section), the owner cannot make the election of preferences for elderly 
families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any 
case where primary sources do not provide 

clear evidence 

of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary
sources conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.

(c) 

Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled 
families

. The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a 
minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for 
occupancy by non-elderly disabled families. 
(1) 

Minimum number of units to be reserved for non-elderly disabled 
families

. The number of units in an elderly project required to be reserved 
for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families, shall be, at a minimum, the 
lesser of: 
(i) The number of units equivalent to the higher of_
(A) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly 
project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families on October 28, 
1992; and 
(B) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly 
project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families upon January 1, 
1992; 

or 
(ii) 10 percent of the number of units assisted under this part in the 
eligible project.

(2) Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled 
families

. The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a 
greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided 
for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater 
number of units to non-elderly disabled families will not obligate the owner 
to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The 
number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at 
any time in an elderly project is that number determined under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section. 
(d) 

Secondary preferences

. An owner of an elderly project also may 
elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of 
this paragraph (d) of this section. 
(1) 

Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for 
elderly families

. If the owner of an elderly project determines, in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient 
number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the 
vacant units in the elderly project reserved for elderly families (that is, 
all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for 
occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.
(2) 

Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for 
non-elderly disabled families

. If the owner of an elderly project determines, 
in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an 
insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant 
units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for 
occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families. 
(e) 

Availability of units to families without regard to preference

. An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to 
otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the 
preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either: 
(1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an 
insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve 
preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant 
units; or 
(2) The owner has 

not 

adopted the secondary preferences and there are 
an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve 
preference has been given to fill all the vacant units. 
(f) 

Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for 
preference

. To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of 
applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences, 
provided by this section, the owner must: 
(1) Conduct marketing in accordance with  881.601(a) to attract 
applicants qualifying for the preferences and reservation of units set forth 
in this section; and 
(2) Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the 
preferences provided in this section, including taking all feasible actions to 
fill vacancies by renting to such families. 
(g) 

Federal preferences

. An owner that gives preferences to elderly 
families and reserves units for non-elderly disabled families in accordance 
with this section also shall select applicants among each respective group in 
accordance with the Federal preferences contained in  881.613. Projects 
under National Housing Act programs and receiving section 8 assistance may be 
subject to preferences in addition to those contained in  881.613 which also 
must be applied in selecting applicants among each respective group. 
(h) 

Prohibition of evictions

. An owner may not evict a tenant without 
good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part 
because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because 
of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 
through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 
(42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620).

6. Section 883.704a is revised to read as follows: 


 883.704a 

Preference for occupancy by elderly families. 


(a) 

Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families. 
(1) Election by owners of eligible projects

. (i) An owner of a 
project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that 
was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an 
``eligible project'') may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly 
families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, 
subject to the requirements of this section. 
(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the 
preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election 
to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an 
``elderly project.'' ``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of 
household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older. 
(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families 
in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting 
list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election 
may affect them if: 
(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the 
project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively 
referred to as ``non-elderly disabled families'') is equal to or exceeds the 
minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly 
families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be 
passed over for covered section 8 units; or 
(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled 
families. 
(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in 
accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's 
waiting list solely on the basis of having made the election. 
(2) 

HUD approval of election not required. 

(i) An owner is not 
required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the 
election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the 
project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be 
able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all 
relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the 
original design of the project. 
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make 
determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as 
an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result 
of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations 
under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance 
reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes. 


(b) Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by 
elderly families

. (1) 

Evidence supporting project eligibility

. Evidence that 
a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally 
designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore 
eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, 
shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed 
in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or at least two items from the sources 
(``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:

eligible project. 

(2) 

Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled 
families. 

The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a 
greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided 
for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater 
number of units to non-elderly disabled families will not obligate the owner 
to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The

(d) 

Secondary preferences. 

An owner of an elderly project also may 
elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of 
this paragraph (d) of this section.

provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for 
occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families. 

(2) 

Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for 
non-elderly disabled families. 

If the owner of an elderly project determines, 
in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an 
insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant 
units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for 
occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families. 

(e) 

Availability of units to families without regard to preference. 

An 
owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to 
otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the 
preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either: 

(1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an 
insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve 
preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant 
units; or 

(2) The owner has 

not

 adopted the secondary preferences and there are 
an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve 
preference has been given to fill all the vacant units. 

(f) 

Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for 
preference. 

To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of 
applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences, 
provided by this section, the owner must:

 886.329a 

Preferences for occupancy by elderly families. 



(a) 

Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families. 

(1) Election by owners of eligible projects. 

(i) An owner of a 
project involving substantial rehabilitation and assisted under this part 
(including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed 
primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an ``eligible project'') may, at 
any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants 
for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this 
section. 

(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the 
preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election 
to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an 
``elderly project.'' ``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of 
household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older. 

(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families 
in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting 
list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election 
may affect them if: 

(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the 
project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively 
referred to as ``non-elderly disabled families'') is equal to or exceeds the 
minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly 
families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be 
passed over for covered section 8 units; or 

(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled 
families. 

(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in 
accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's 
waiting list solely on the basis of having made the election. 

(2) 

HUD approval of election not required. 

(i) An owner is not 
required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the 
election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the 
project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be 
able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all 
relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the 
original design of the project.
