Importation of Certain Cattle From Mexico; Identification Requirements 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the animal importation regulations to require that certain spayed heifers imported into the United
States from Mexico be marked with a permanent, legible ``M

x

'' on the right hip, and that certain steers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent,
legible ``M'' on the right hip, rather than on the jaw. These marking requirements are necessary to ensure that all
steers and spayed heifers imported into the United States from Mexico, except those imported directly to slaughter
or in-bond for feeding and return to Mexico, are clearly identifiable as being of Mexican origin. These marking requirements
will facilitate the disease surveillance and traceback activities conducted in the United States under the National
Cooperative State-Federal Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 92 prohibit or restrict the importation of certain animals into the United States to prevent
the introduction of communicable diseases of livestock and poultry. Subpart D of part 92 
(  92.400 through 92.435), referred to below as the regulations, pertains to the importation of ruminants.
Sections 92.424 through 92.429 of the regulations contain specific provisions regarding the importation of ruminants,
including cattle, from Mexico. 
One of the diseases addressed by the regulations is bovine tuberculosis (referred to below as tuberculosis). Tuberculosis
is a serious communicable disease of cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused by 

Mycobacterium bovis. 

Tuberculosis in animals causes weight loss, general debilitation, and sometimes death. 
Each year, approximately 1 million cattle are imported into the United States from Mexico. The vast majority of those
cattle_about 99 percent_are young steers; the remaining 1 percent consists of spayed heifers and intact cattle (i.e.,
calves, bulls, and unspayed females). The steers and spayed heifers are, with few exceptions, consigned to pastures
or feedlots for finish feeding prior to slaughter. Most intact cattle are integrated into herds in the United States
for breeding purposes. 
The period between 1982 and 1992 saw a significant increase in the number of Mexican-origin cattle found at slaughter
in the United States to be infected with tuberculosis. In 1982, 78 samples submitted from slaughtered Mexican-origin
cattle showed evidence of tuberculosis; that number rose to 613 in 1992. In 1982, 33 percent of the tuberculosis investigations
at slaughter involved Mexican origin cattle; in 1992, that number rose to 81 percent. 
That increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in Mexican-origin cattle led the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) to publish in the 

Federal Register

 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59963-59965, Docket No. 93-006-1), a proposed rule to amend the regulations
to require that spayed heifers and intact cattle (i.e., calves, bulls, and unspayed female cattle) imported into
the United States from Mexico be branded with an ``M'' on the jaw using a hot iron, which was the same requirement that
applied to most steers imported from Mexico. Based on the comments we received from individuals and organizations
opposed to that proposal, as well as public concern that branding on the jaw caused unnecessary distress to cattle,
we withdrew the November 12, 1993, proposed rule referenced above and replaced it with an alternative proposal. 
In the alternative proposal, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43506-43508, Docket No. 93-006-2), we proposed to amend the regulations
to require that certain spayed heifers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent, legible
``M

x

'' on the right hip, and that certain steers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent,
legible ``M'' on the right hip, rather than on the jaw. 
We solicited comments concerning our alternative proposal for a 60-day period ending October 24, 1994. We received
more than 12,000 comments by that date. They were from private citizens, animal rights organizations, a member of
Congress, cattle industry associations, ranchers, representatives of State governments, and a veterinary medical
association. We carefully considered all of the comments we received. They are discussed below. 
Many commenters did not address the specific provisions of the proposed rule; rather, they either demanded that APHIS
discontinue face branding or stated that they supported APHIS' proposal to discontinue face branding of steers.
We have, therefore, taken such comments to support that aspect of the proposal that would change the location of the
``M'' brand on steers from the jaw to the right hip. 
A few commenters objected to the proposed rule in its entirety because they felt that APHIS should conduct its disease
surveillance activities as it sees fit and should not capitulate to outside pressure to change its methods. We have
made no changes in this final rule based on such comments because we believe that the provisions of the proposed rule
and this final rule do not negatively affect APHIS' ability to conduct its disease surveillance activities. 
Several commenters felt that moving the brand from the face to the hip was no improvement, and that all M-branding should
be discontinued. We have made no changes in this final rule based on such comments because we continue to believe, for
the reasons discussed below, that some type of permanent marking is necessary to identify cattle imported into the
United States from Mexico. 
One commenter urged APHIS to keep the location of the brand on the jaw because branding on other locations can markedly
reduce the value of the hide. While it is true that marking methods such as hot-iron branding and freeze branding do
damage the hides of cattle and would likely result in some loss of value, many private entities such as cattle owners
and feedlots routinely brand cattle on areas of the hide that would have trimmed to produce a ``clean'' hide. Moreover,
we do not believe that the economic considerations associated with the placement of the brand on the hip are significant
enough to warrant such a change in this final rule, especially given the degree of public support for our proposal to
relocate the brand from the jaw to the hip. 
Two commenters stated that the location of the brand should remain on the jaw, which has been set aside by some State
livestock agencies for ``government'' brands. They argued that brands on the hip would be less visible and could be
easily confused with registered ownership brands_a number of which are similar to the ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark_or feedlot brands. The same location specified for the ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark has been used by APHIS for the placement of ``S'' brands under the brucellosis regulations in 9 CFR part 78 since
1983, and we are unaware of any identification problems resulting from that requirement. In terms of the visibility
of the ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark, the mark will be predictably located on each animal, so we believe that State and Federal animal health personnel
will be able to readily discern the mark when necessary. Therefore, we have made no changes in this final rule as a result
of those comments.

One commenter stated that the anatomical reference point specified for location of the brand on the hip_between the
fourth to seventh coccygeal vertebrae_is on the moveable part of the tail and could not accommodate a 2- to 3-inch brand.
Although the regulatory text of the proposed rule called for the placement of the ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark on the ``right hip, high on the tailhead,'' the anatomical reference point specified for the placement of the
mark was, as pointed out by the commenter, incorrect. To remedy that error, we have changed the specific anatomical
reference point to ``over the junction of the sacral and first coccygeal vertebrae'' in the regulatory text of this
final rule. Another commenter stated that the specified area is concave on thin cattle, which would result in incomplete,
unreadable brands on such cattle. We do not believe that the concavity of the area near the tailhead on most cattle would
be pronounced enough to result in an appreciable number of unreadable brands. Additionally, if an animal were to be
offered for importation with an unreadable ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark, that animal would be refused entry. 

One commenter stated that the placement of the brand on the hip would make it possible for a person to modify the brand
by, for example, branding an additional line or symbol close to the ``M'' or ``M

x

''; having done that, the person could attempt to portray the modified brand as an ownership brand in order to disguise
the animal's Mexican origin. Certainly an ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark could be altered, just as any private or regulatory brand could be altered. However, because we are requiring
that the ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark be placed in a specific location that is not likely to be used for marking by private entities, we do not believe
that the commenter's concerns will be a problem. As mentioned above, the ``S'' brands applied to brucellosis-exposed
cattle under the regulations in 9 CFR part 78 are placed in the same location near the tailhead as the ``M'' and ``M

x

'' marks are to be placed, and we are unaware of any attempts to modify those ``S'' brands during the 11 years they have
been used. Additionally, we believe that State brand registries and State animal identification regulations will
help to discourage persons from taking the actions envisioned by the commenter. We have, therefore, made no changes
in this final rule as a result of that comment. 

One commenter urged APHIS to expand the scope of the marking requirements to include intact Mexican cattle because
such cattle are often integrated into domestic herds for breeding purposes, thus heightening the potential for the
Mexican-origin cattle to expose domestic cattle to disease. As we explained in the proposed rule, we believe that
the small number of intact cattle imported into the United States from Mexico each year, plus the fact that the interstate
movement of intact cattle is regulated under the brucellosis regulations in 9 CFR part 78, make it significantly easier
for APHIS to trace the movement of Mexican-origin intact cattle following their entry into the United States. Therefore,
we do not believe that it is necessary to permanently identify such cattle as being of Mexican origin. 

One commenter urged APHIS to expand the scope of the marking requirements to include cattle imported from Mexico in
bond for feeding and return to Mexico under  92.427(e) of the regulations because such cattle are not always
returned to Mexico since the U.S. Customs Service stopped collecting the bond as a result of the North American Free
Trade Agreement. We are aware of the potential problems with the in-bond program and are currently reconsidering
the regulations governing the program. We do not, however, believe that expanding the marking requirements to include
in-bond cattle is necessary at this time. If, at some point, we determine that such a change is necessary, the change
would be proposed as part of a separate rulemaking. 

Two commenters pointed out that APHIS currently has two proposed rules that have not yet been finalized that would
render most M-branding unnecessary. The first proposed rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 9, 1994 (59 FR 23810-23817, Docket No. 93-014-1), would establish comprehensive quarantine
and surveillance requirements for Mexican cattle offered for importation into the United States. The second proposed
rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59959-59962, Docket No. 93-084-1), would require the individual identification
on a health certificate of imported Mexican-origin cattle being moved interstate. The commenters noted that the
quarantine measures, movement restrictions, and documentation requirements contained in those proposed rules
are similar to the restrictions currently placed on cattle imported from Mexico for slaughter in accordance with
 92.429 of the regulations or in bond for temporary entry in accordance with  92.427(e) of the regulations.
The commenters argued that if APHIS believes that it is not necessary to brand in-bond and immediate slaughter cattle,
then it should not be necessary to brand Mexican cattle affected by the two proposed rules. Both of the proposed rules
mentioned by the commenter are still being considered by APHIS and have not been finalized. Because the provisions
of those two proposals have not been promulgated in final regulations, they have no regulatory effect; we cannot make
any changes in this final rule that are based on the provisions of other proposed regulations. However, a similar comment
was received in response to the May 1994 proposed rule mentioned above (Docket No. 93-014-1), so the suggestion
of exemptions from the branding requirement for cattle affected by the provisions of that proposed rule will be considered
and discussed in any final rulemaking related to that proposed rule. 

One commenter stated that branding is unnecessary because the official Mexican Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources (SARH) blue eartag required by the regulations in  92.427(d) can be used to identify Mexican-origin
cattle. We agree that the blue SARH eartag is an important identification tool, but we remain concerned that eartags
can be lost or removed. With the an ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark present, we could still determine an animal's country of origin if its eartag were lost or removed. Additionally,
we believe that it is less likely that someone would remove the SARH tag from an ``M'' or ``M

x

'' marked animal in an attempt to conceal the animal's Mexican origin, so the SARH tag, with its value as a traceback
tool, is more likely to remain on the animal. 

Some commenters stated that because APHIS has acknowledged that freeze branding can be used to identify cattle imported
from Mexico, APHIS should respond to the public opposition to hot-iron branding by prohibiting hot-iron branding
and requiring the use of freeze branding. Similarly, another commenter felt that freeze branding should be the standard
identification method and hot-iron branding should be allowed only if the exporter has submitted a written justification
for using hot-iron branding. Although we acknowledge that freeze branding can work as a means of identifying cattle
imported from Mexico, we also recognize that freeze branding has its limitations. First, a freeze brand takes 18 to
21 days to become visible, and there may be some exporters of cattle for whom branding that far in advance of offering
their cattle for entry into the United States is not a viable option. Second, freeze brands are not visible on white
or light-colored hair, and there will certainly be cattle offered for importation that have white or light-colored
hair at the location specified for the placement of the ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark. Because APHIS will not allow cattle with unreadable brands into the United States, requiring the use of freeze
branding would have the effect of prohibiting the importation of certain cattle based on their coloring. Therefore,
we believe that hot-iron branding should remain an option for exporters of cattle from Mexico. 

Another commenter stated that freeze branding will not be an effective means of identifying Mexican-origin cattle
because so many of those cattle have light-colored hair or white spots. As discussed above, we acknowledge that freeze
branding is not going to be an option for all cattle in all cases. The regulations require a distinct, permanent, and
legible ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark on certain cattle offered for entry; we believe that it is reasonable to expect that the exporter of the cattle
will keep that requirement, as well as the advantages and limitations of hot-iron branding and freeze branding, in
mind when selecting a marking method.

Many commenters stated that APHIS should discontinue branding in favor of using microchips to individually identify
Mexican-origin cattle. Some of the commenters pointed to studies that indicated that microchip technology would
be well-suited to APHIS' stated goals of disease surveillance and traceback. We agree that microchips are useful,
but several factors prevent us from changing the regulations to require their use. We continue to believe that an identification
method must be distinct, permanent, and legible; microchips fail to fully satisfy those three criteria. In terms
of 
distinctness, we believe that the identification should be readily visible, which microchips, clearly, are not.
In terms of permanence, a microchip implanted in an animal could be removed or could migrate to other parts of the body.
In terms of legibility, information can be readily stored on and retrieved from microchips, but there is no universal
chip reader that can access the information stored on chips produced by different manufacturers. 

In addition to the many suggestions that APHIS use microchips to identify Mexican-origin cattle, numerous commenters
offered other alternatives to M-branding. Those commenters suggested that APHIS use: Stickers, bells, ribbons,
tail cropping, ear notching, tags, ear tags, magic markers, paint, indelible dye, stamps on the tails, and rings on
the tails. As is the case with microchips, none of these suggested identification meets our criteria for distinctness,
permanence, and legibility. Paints, dyes, stamps, and markers can fade or be obscured; stickers, bells, ribbons,
and rings can be lost or removed; and notching or cropping, although permanent, are not readily and distinctly visible
or legible. 

One commenter noted that the proposed new text of  92.427(c)(2) makes no mention of freeze branding, even though
it eliminates the requirement for hot-iron branding. The commenter asked that freeze branding be mentioned, even
encouraged, in the revised regulatory text of  92.427(c)(2) in order to inform persons who have read only the
regulations, and not the supplementary information provided in the proposed rule and this final rule, that freeze
branding may be used to identify cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. We agree that the marking methods
acceptable to APHIS should be set forth in the regulations and have changed the regulatory text in this final rule to
explicitly state that the ``M'' or ``M

x

'' mark may be applied with a freeze brand or hot iron. 

One commenter noted that although the proposed rule would allow the use of freeze branding or hot-iron branding to
mark spayed heifers, an unpublished APHIS ovariectomy protocol that requires the M-branding of certain spayed heifers_even
though that requirement is not published in the regulations_appears to require that a hot iron be used to apply the
brand. The protocol states that the ``M

x

'' mark on spayed heifers must be a ``distinct, permanent mark which is legible on the right side of the tailhead as defined
in Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 78.'' The commenter stated that there is no definition of ``distinct,''
``permanent,'' or ``mark'' in those regulations, but there are definitions of different types of brands associated
with the APHIS brucellosis eradication program that describe the brands exclusively, or predominantly, as being
applied with a hot iron. The commenter felt that the protocol should be reworded to make it clear that freeze branding
and other methods may be used to apply the ``M

x

'' mark on spayed heifers. The protocol to which the commenter is referring is part of the cooperative services agreement
between APHIS and a private sector veterinarian that provides for APHIS veterinary medical officers to monitor ovariectomies
performed on heifers located in Mexico prior to their importation into the United States. The protocol does not state
that hot-iron branding must be used or that freeze branding may not be used; the ``distinct, permanent mark'' language
was meant to allow both methods without specifying either. The revised text of  92.427(c)(2) now clearly states
that either freeze branding or hot-iron branding may be used, so even if the protocol were construed to prohibit freeze
branding, the regulations would preempt the protocol and freeze branding would be allowed. 

Some commenters stated that APHIS should develop faster, more accurate tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and
work to eradicate tuberculosis in Mexico, which would eliminate the need to brand cattle from Mexico. We agree that
eradicating tuberculosis in Mexico would eliminate the need for branding cattle from Mexico, but that goal has not
yet been attained. Researchers from APHIS, other Federal agencies, and private entities are constantly working
to develop better ways to diagnose and prevent the spread of diseases, including tuberculosis. Additionally, APHIS
and the Mexican Government, along with the livestock industries in the United States and Mexico, are cooperating
in a joint effort to eradicate tuberculosis in Mexico. 

Some commenters felt that since APHIS proposed to end the face branding of cattle from Mexico, it should also change
the provisions of its regulations in 9 CFR parts 50, 51, 77, 78, and 80 that allow or require face branding. We have received
similar requests and are giving them serious consideration. However, any changes to those regulations would have
to be part of a separate rulemaking proceeding. 

Some commenters had the impression that APHIS knowingly allowed tuberculosis-infected cattle to be imported from
Mexico and was using the M-brand to identify and track those cattle. Those commenters felt that APHIS should test all
cattle offered for importation into the United States from Mexico for tuberculosis before allowing the cattle into
this country. Other commenters understood that APHIS does indeed require cattle offered for importation from Mexico
to be tested or, in the case of cattle imported for immediate slaughter under  92.429, accompanied by a certificate
stating that they have been examined and found free from evidence of communicable disease, before allowing the cattle
into this country. Those commenters did, however, state that APHIS should do a better job of testing or alter its methods
to include a 60-day pre-entry quarantine followed by a tuberculosis test for cattle offered for importation into
the United States from Mexico. As mentioned above, we are considering rulemaking that would establish additional
quarantine and testing requirements similar to those mentioned by the commenter. Until such time as additional quarantine
and testing requirements are put in place, we will continue to utilize the available tools and methods in our efforts
to prevent the entry into the United States of tuberculosis from Mexico.

One commenter stated that while APHIS has said that M-branding is necessary to facilitate the disease eradication
and surveillance objectives of the National Cooperative State/Federal Tuberculosis Eradication Program, it has
failed to establish how M-branding actually serves those objectives. Because of that failure, it follows that there
is no rational basis to support the expansion of M-branding to spayed heifers and those provisions of the proposed
rule dealing with the branding of spayed heifers should be withdrawn. We believe that we have established the need
for M-branding in previous rulemakings. The permanence of branding is perhaps the key factor in our reliance on M-branding;
other identification methods can be lost, removed, or obscured. As we have stated before, M-branding is the only permanent,
readily visible means we have to identify cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. We believe that the higher
incidence of tuberculosis in Mexico makes it necessary for us to be able to identify such cattle when searching for
the origin of a tuberculosis-infected animal. If we can determine that a diseased animal originated in Mexico, we
will not waste time and effort searching for its herd of origin in the United States. Conversely, if the animal is not
M-branded, we can concentrate our disease traceback efforts to those cattle that are more likely to be of U.S. origin.
We continue to believe that M-branding serves the needs of our tuberculosis eradication efforts. 

In addition to the comments discussed above, some of the commenters raised issues that are not within the scope of the
proposed rule and, in some cases, are not within APHIS' regulatory purview. Those issues related to: The treatment
of calves by veal producers, the treatment of geese by fois gras producers, the treatment of chickens by poultry producers,
horse roping for sport in Mexico, rodeos in Mexico and the United States, the use of bovine growth hormone in dairy herds,
banning shetitah (the slaughtering of animals for food in the manner prescribed by Jewish law), conditions at zoos
in the United States, government spending to promote fur exports, the transportation of farm animals and the care
of animals injured during movement, ``factory farming,'' and the welfare of laboratory animals. Because such comments
are outside the scope of the proposed rule, no changes have been made in this final rule as a result of those comments.
Any regulatory changes related to those issues within APHIS' regulatory purview would have to be proposed as part
of a separate proposed rule. 

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule, with the changes discussed in this document. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for the
purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 

Cattle imported from Mexico account for about 1 percent of the total U.S. cattle population, which in 1991 stood at
99.4 million head. The average price per head for cattle from Mexico in 1991 was $350, with the total value of imported
Mexican cattle exceeding $361 million for the year. During 1991, approximately 1 million live cattle were imported
into the United States from Mexico. 

We are amending the animal importation regulations to require that certain spayed heifers imported into the United
States from Mexico be marked with a permanent, legible ``M

x

'' on the right hip, and that certain steers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent,
legible ``M'' on the right hip, rather than on the jaw. 

Three primary considerations led APHIS to conclude that the marking requirements contained in this rule will not
have an economic impact on any U.S. entities, large or small. First, all steers imported into the United States from
Mexico, except those steers imported for immediate slaughter or in-bond for feeding and return to Mexico, were already
required to be identified with an M-brand. For these steers, which represent 99 percent of the cattle imported into
the United States from Mexico, only the location of the ``M'' has changed. 

The second consideration follows from the first: That is, although there had been no provisions in the regulations
requiring spayed heifers to be permanently identified as being of Mexican origin, spayed heifers represent less
than 1 percent of the cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. Thus, requiring certain spayed heifers to
be marked with an ``M

x

'' prior to arriving at the U.S. port of entry will have an insignificant effect on exporters or importers of spayed
heifers from Mexico. 

The third consideration is that the cost of marking the cattle, which is negligible, will be borne by the Mexican exporter
of the cattle. 

Therefore, we expect this rule will have no significant economic impact on any large or small entities because its
provisions will not significantly increase or decrease their cost of doing business. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).

Change in Disease Status of Portugal Because of BSE 



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations by adding Portugal to
the list of countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) exists, because the disease has been detected
in native cattle in that country. The interim rule prohibited or restricted the importation of certain fresh, chilled,
and frozen meat, and certain other animal products and animal byproducts from ruminants which have been in Portugal.
The interim rule was necessary to reduce the risk that BSE could be introduced into the United States.

List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: Addition 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to add the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular
System to the List of 
Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks. This amendment allows the holders of power 
reactor operating licenses to store spent fuel in this approved cask under a 
general license. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) includes 
the following directive: ``The Secretary [of the Department of Energy (DOE)] 
shall establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private 
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear reactor 
power sites, with the objective of establishing one or more technologies that 
the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites 
of civilian nuclear power reactors without, to the maximum extent practicable, 
the need for additional site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' After 
subsequent DOE technical evaluations and based on a full review of all 
available data, the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a 
final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181). The final rule established a new Subpart K within 10 CFR Part 72 entitled ``General License
for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' 

Irradiated reactor fuel has been handled under dry conditions since the 
mid-1940s when irradiated fuel examinations began in hot cells. Light-water 
reactor fuel has been examined dry in hot cells, since approximately 1960. Irradiated reactor fuel has been stored
continuously at hot cells under dry 
conditions for approximately two decades. The NRC's experience with storage 
of spent fuel in dry casks is extensive as described in the proposed rule to 
establish 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K (May 5, 1989; 54 FR 19379). Further, the 
United States has extensive experience in the licensing and safe operation of 
independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSIs). By the end of 1994, 
six site-specific licenses for dry cask storage will have been issued: 
Virginia Power's Surry Station, issued July 2, 1986; Carolina Power and 
Light's (CP&L) HB Robinson Station, issued August 13, 1986; Duke Power's 
Oconee Station, issued January 29, 1990; Public Service of Colorado's Fort 
St. Vrain facility, issued November 4, 1991; Baltimore Gas and Electric's 
(BG&E) Calvert Cliffs Station, issued November 25, 1992; and Northern States 
Power's (NSP) Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, issued October 19, 
1993. All except NSP have commenced operation and loaded fuel. At the end of 
1994, dry storage spent fuel inventories of these utilities are as follows: 
500 assemblies at Virginia Power, 60 assemblies at CP&L, 530 assemblies at 
Duke Power, 1480 fuel elements at Public Service of Colorado, and 
190 assemblies at BG&E. NSP plans to begin storing fuel soon. In May 1993, 
Consumers Power's Palisades Station commenced operation and loaded fuel under 
the provisions of the general license in 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K. At the 
end of 1994, approximately 168 assemblies are stored at Palisades.

As a result of the growing use of dry storage technology, the NRC has 
gained over 35 staff years of experience in the review and licensing of dry 
spent fuel storage systems. In addition, the NRC draws upon the knowledge and 
experience of outside scientists and engineers recognized as experts within 
their respective fields in the performance of the independent safety analysis 
of the system and component designs submitted by applicants for dry cask 
licenses or certification. Reviews of numerous applications seeking site- 
specific licenses, certificates of compliance, or approvals of topical 
reports, have been conducted over the past eight years. More recently, the 
NRC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 on 
June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28496), which proposed to amend 10 CFR 72.214 to include 
one additional spent fuel storage cask (i.e., the VECTRA Technologies, Inc., 
Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System) on the list of approved 
spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees may use under the 
provisions of a general license issued by NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 
Part 72, Subpart K. The Standardized NUHOMS consists of two systems: (1) The 
NUHOMS-24P holds 24 specified pressurized-water reactor spent fuel assemblies 
and (2) The NUHOMS-52B holds 52 specified boiling-water reactor spent fuel 
assemblies. 

Subsequent to the expiration of the 75-day public comment period on 
August 16, 1994, NRC received a request, dated August 11, 1994, for a 6-week 
extension of the comment period from Connie Kline of the Sierra Club on behalf 
of 12 citizen groups. The extension request asserted that several proprietary 
documents related to this rulemaking were not available to the public for 
approximately 2 weeks at the beginning of the comment period. The NRC granted 
the request on August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44381) by extending the public comment 
period to September 30, 1994. 

VECTRA Technologies, Inc. (formerly Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.) 
submitted to the NRC a Safety Analysis Report (SAR) entitled ``Safety Analysis 
Report for the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System for 
Irradiated Nuclear Fuel,'' NUH-003, Revision 2, dated November 1993. 
Subsequently, VECTRA Technologies, Inc. provided additional information to the 
NRC related to the SAR. In March 1994, the NRC issued a draft Safety 
Evaluation Report (SER) entitled ``Safety Evaluation Report of Pacific Nuclear 
Fuel Services, Inc. Safety Analysis Report for the Standardized NUHOMS 
Horizontal Storage System for Irradiated Nuclear Fuel'' approving the SAR. The 
NRC issued a draft Certificate of Compliance by letter to Mr. Robert D. Quinn 
from Mr. Frederick C. Sturz dated April 28, 1994. These documents are part of 
the docket and record that support the proposed rule published in the 

Federal Register 

on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28496). 

The objective of 10 CFR Part 72 is to protect the public health and 
safety by providing for the safe confinement of the stored fuel and preventing 
the degradation of the fuel cladding. The review criteria used by the NRC for 
review and approval of dry cask storage under 10 CFR Part 72 consider the 
following factors: siting, design, quality assurance, emergency planning, 
training, and physical protection of the fuel. Phenomena such as earthquakes, 
high winds, tornados, tornado driven missiles, lightning, and floods are 
included in the review of a specific system, either for a certificate of 
compliance or a site-specific license. In addition, applicants must 
demonstrate to NRC's satisfaction that their proposed dry cask system will 
resist man-made events such as explosions, fire, and drop or tipover 
accidents.





Based on further NRC review and analysis of public comments, both the 
SER and Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized NUHOMS were modified. 
Section M contains a description of changes to the SER and Certificate of 
Compliance in response to public comments. The NRC finds that the 
Standardized NUHOMS, as designed and when fabricated and used in accordance 
with the conditions specified in its Certificate of Compliance, meets the 
requirements of 10 CFR Part 72. Thus, use of the Standardized NUHOMS, as 
approved by the NRC, will provide adequate protection of the public health and 
safety and the environment. With this final rule, the NRC is approving the 
use of the Standardized NUHOMS under the general license in 10 CFR Part 72, 
Subpart K, by holders of power reactor operating licenses under 10 CFR 
Part 50. Simultaneously, the NRC is issuing a final Certificate of Compliance 
to be effective on January 23, 1995. A copy of the Certificate of Compliance is available for public inspection 
and/or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. 
(Lower Level), Washington, DC. 



Public Responses 



In response to the proposed addition of the Standardized NUHOMS, 
239 comments in 27 letters with one supplement were received from individuals, 
public interest groups, an environmental group, an association, industry 
representatives, a city, states, and one Federal agency. One commenter 
withdrew his comments. Many of these letters contained similar comments that 
have been grouped together and addressed as a single issue. All comments have 
been grouped into 15 broad issues designated A through O. A summary of the 
comments and an NRC analysis and response to those comments is included for 
each broad issue. The NRC has identified and responded to 89 separate issues 
that include the significant points raised by each commenter.

A number of comments were related to the disposal of high-level waste 
and the use of dry cask storage technology in general, rather than to the 
acceptability of this particular cask. Examples of these comments include: 




_The Federal Government's failure to resolve questions about the 
permanent storage of nuclear waste leaves both the plant and public 
with limited options: additional storage in pools, additional storage 
in dry casks, or plant shutdown. The Federal Government has an 
obligation to resolve the issue of permanent or interim storage. It 
would be difficult to overstate the need for dispatch in doing so, as 
hundreds of American communities will eventually face this problem. 
_It is not fair to the public of Ohio to link Toledo Edison Company's 
attempts to continue the safe storage of its nuclear fuel with 
insistence by others that the NRC shut down Davis-Besse and every other 
nuclear plant in the country. 
_Only dry storage casks that are compatible with future DOE interim or 
permanent storage operation, including transportation, should be 
approved for use under the general license and listed in 10 CFR 72.214. 





These comments deal with broad policy and program issues relating to the 
storage and disposal of high-level radioactive waste, including the DOE's 
repository program and as such are beyond the scope of this rule. However, 
there is a summary of relevant information on many of these broad issues in 
Group G. Many comments were directed at the Standardized NUHOMS-24P with only 
a few comments being specific to the Standardized NUHOMS-52B. 

Many commenters discussed topics that were not the subject of this 
rulemaking and thus were not specifically addressed by the NRC staff as a part 
of this final rule action. These comments express opposition to the use of 
dry cask storage and included the following suggestions and topics: 
(1) Nuclear plants generating radioactive waste should be shut down. 

(2) The production of radioactive waste should be stopped when the 
existing spent fuel pool (and off-load-reactor capacity) is full. 

(3) A formal hearing should be required at each site using dry storage 
casks. 

(4) The Davis-Besse plant should be shut down. 

(5) The use of nuclear power should be stopped and existing sites 
cleaned up. 

(6) Palisades experienced problems in using the VSC-24 cask. 

(7) Alternative forms of power should be used. 

Finally, many commenters expressed concern over the ability of dry cask 
storage designs, presumably including the Standardized NUHOMS, to store spent 
fuel safely. The following responses to these comments reflect a small but 
important portion of the NRC's review of health, safety, and environmental 
aspects of the Standardized NUHOMS to ensure that the cask is designed to 
provide protection of the public health and safety and environment under both 
normal conditions and severe, unlikely but credible, accident conditions. Dry 
cask storage systems are massive devices, designed and analyzed to provide 
shielding from direct exposure to radiation, to confine the spent fuel in a 
safe storage condition, and to prevent releases of radiation to the 
environment. They are designed to perform these tasks by relying on passive 
heat removal and confinement systems without moving parts and with minimal 
reliance on human intervention to safely fulfill their function for the term 
of storage. The NRC staff has concluded that the methods of analysis are 
conservative and assure that the design has appropriate margins of safety 
under both normal and accident conditions.

Analysis of Public Comment 


A. A number of commenters raised issues relating to cask handling and 
the ability of the cask to withstand drop and tipover accidents. 
A.1. 

Comment. 

Several commenters wanted the transfer cask containing 
the Dry Storage Canister (DSC) to be analyzed for the maximum possible drop, 
regardless of whether that drop can occur inside or outside the spent fuel 
building. One commenter alleged that a drop of the transfer cask into the 
spent fuel pool would damage fuel assemblies in the pool. Another commenter 
was concerned about jamming the transfer cask in the spent fuel pool. What 
would happen to the cask if jammed fuel could not be extricated? Would the 
entire 40 ton transfer cask be left in the fuel pool? 


Response. 

Use of the Standardized NUHOMS inside the fuel handling 
building would be conducted in accordance with the 10 CFR Part 50 reactor 
operating license. These cask handling operations, including loading, 
retrieval, and training, must be evaluated by the general licensee as required 
by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(4) to ensure that procedures are clear and can be 
conducted safely. Load handling activities and possible load drop events with 
structural and radiological consequences related to transfer cask drops inside 
the spent fuel building are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59. Thus, 
the licensee must determine whether the activities involve any unreviewed 
facility safety question or any change in facility technical specifications. 
The transfer cask and DSC designs were evaluated by the NRC against the 
criteria for controlling heavy loads that are found in NRC's NUREG-0612,
 
``Control of Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) N14.6, ``Special Lifting Devices for Shipping 
Containers Weighing 10,000 Pounds or More.'' The lifting yoke associated with 
the transfer cask is a special purpose device designed to ANSI N14.6 criteria 
to ensure that the yoke can safely lift the wet transfer cask containing the 
DSC out of the spent fuel pool and can safely lift the dry transfer cask and 
DSC to the transport trailer. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59, for those reactor 
plants with a shipping cask drop analysis, the licensee must verify that the 
shipping cask drop analysis adequately describes the consequences of a 
postulated transfer cask drop and that no unreviewed safety question exists. 
For those reactor plants that may lack a shipping cask drop analysis, each 
licensee must perform a transfer cask drop analysis pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. 






Specific requirements for lifting the transfer cask are contained in the 
Certificate of Compliance and SER. However, movement of the transfer cask in 
the spent fuel pool building must, as required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(4), be 
evaluated by the licensee pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. The possibility of 
jamming a transfer cask while in the spent fuel pool is one of many issues to 
be evaluated under 10 CFR 50.59. 
A.2. 

Comment. 

One commenter asked why the transfer cask with the DSC 
can be lifted to 80 inches outside the spent fuel pool building when it has to 
be unloaded and inspected for damage if it drops from above 15 inches. Why 
not limit the height to 15 inches? 


Response. 

The transfer cask with the DSC rides on the transport 
trailer at a height of greater than 15 inches and therefore was analyzed for a 
drop from that height (80 inches). A drop from a height between 15 and 
80 inches does not pose a public health and safety hazard. However, to ensure 
safety the NRC requires the DSC to be unloaded and inspected for damage. 
A.3. 

Comment. 

One commenter asked about the tipover analysis or drop 
analysis result. 


Response. 

The tipover, end drops, and horizontal drop analyses 
form part of the structural design basis for the Standardized NUHOMS design. 
The designer, VECTRA, described these drop and tipover analyses in SAR, 
Section 8.2.5. The NRC's evaluation of the vendor's analyses is described in 
SER, Section 3.2.2.3E. The NRC found the results of these analyses to be 
satisfactory, because the calculated stresses were all within the allowable 
criteria of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code. 
A.4. 

Comment. 

Several commenters, citing Section 1.1.1 of the draft 
Certificate of Compliance, requested that the postulated cask drop accident in 
the plant fuel handling area be included in the list of parameters and 
analyses that will need verification by the system user (for the 10 CFR 50.59 
safety evaluation). 


Response. 

As stated in Section 1.1.1 of the draft Certificate of 
Compliance, a holder of a 10 CFR Part 50 license before use of the general 
license under 10 CFR Part 72, must determine whether activities related to 
storage of spent fuel involve any unreviewed facility safety issues or changes 
in facility technical specifications as provided under 10 CFR 50.59. Fuel 
handling including the possible drop of a spent fuel cask is among the 
activities that are required to be verified. Fuel handling operations, 
including spent fuels and fresh fuels, are routine within the nuclear power 
plant and are subject to NRC regulation under 10 CFR Part 50. A holder of a 
10 CFR Part 50 license is required to establish operating procedures for spent 
fuel handling and to provide emergency planning to address a potential cask 
drop accident in the reactor's fuel handling area (Certificate of Compliance, 
Section 1.1.4). Therefore the NRC considers it clear that the spent fuel 
operation in the nuclear power plant should be evaluated to verify that the 
possible drop of a spent fuel cask does not raise an unreviewed safety issue 
or require a facility technical specification change appropriately regulated 
under 10 CFR Part 50. 
A.5. 

Comment. 

One commenter stated that there is no place to unload 
the spent fuel in the event of a canister breach. There is no indication that 
the canister, the canister lifting mechanism, or the transport mechanism to 
move the canister into the cask, are nuclear grade equipment or have been 
designed to prevent a single failure from breaching the canister and 
circumventing the protection provided by the sole barrier provided by the 
canister wall itself. 


Response. 

According to 10 CFR 72.122(1), storage systems must be 
designed to allow ready retrieval of the spent fuel in storage. A general 
licensee using an NRC-approved cask must maintain the capability to unload a 
cask. Typically, this will be done by maintaining the capability to unload a 
cask in the reactor fuel pool. Other options are under consideration that 
would permit unloading a cask outside the reactor pool.

With respect to canister equipment and design, the DSC or canister is 
designed to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC), Section III, 
Subsection NB. The DSC provides a containment boundary for the radioactive 
material and the cladding of the fuel rods provides confinement of fuel 
pellets. Only intact fuel assemblies (rods) with no known cladding defects 
greater than pin holes and hairline cracks are permitted to be stored. This 
approach assures the structural integrity of the fuel to confine the fuel 
pellets and its retrivability. In the unlikely event of a breach that 
required the canister to be unloaded, the canister can be returned to the 
reactor spent fuel pool. Therefore, it is incorrect to assert that there is 
no place to unload a canister. The Horizontal Storage Module (HSM) is 
designed to American Concrete Institute (ACI) 349, which is the required code 
for nuclear structures made of reinforced concrete. The transfer cask is 
designed according to the ASME BPVC, Section III, Subsection NC; ANSI-N14.6 
for heavy loads; ANSI-50.9 for load combinations; and NUREG/CR 1815 for impact 
testing. Because the cask itself is required to meet such exacting standards 
of construction, the transport mechanism and the trailer that move the 
canister into the HSM are not considered to be important to safety. 
Therefore, the design that meets industry standards is sufficient. 
B. A number of commenters raised issues relating to releases of 
radioactivity from surface contamination and leakage from the casks under 
normal and accident conditions.
B.1. 

Comment.

 One commenter pointed out that the Certificate of 
Compliance Surveillance Requirement 1.2.12 does not have a section stating the 
action that is to be taken when the contamination level in the transfer cask 
exceeds limits after the DSC has been transferred to the concrete HSM. 


Response.

 The Certificate of Compliance Surveillance Requirement 
in Section 1.2.12 has been modified to clarify that decontamination of the 
transfer cask is required if the surface contamination limit is exceeded. 
B.2. 

Comment.

 One commenter, who was concerned with the seismic events at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, stated that a displacement
pulse of 60 cm, as observed in the Lander's quake in the Mojave Desert northeast of Los Angeles, would completely destroy
the HSM and allow a substantial release of radioactivity from the fuel within. 


Response.

 The potential for a seismic event is not the same at 
every reactor site in the United States. For Davis-Besse, the maximum ground 
displacement has been calculated to be 3.33 inches (8.46 cm), corresponding to 
a 0.15g maximum ground acceleration. This is substantially less than the 
displacement observed in the Lander's quake and appears to be well within the 
design of the Standardized NUHOMS. Each general licensee using the 
Standardized NUHOMS, including Davis-Besse is required to document their 
evaluations to determine that the reactor site parameters, including seismic 
events, envelope the cask design basis, as specified in its SAR and SER. 
B.3. 

Comment.

 One commenter, citing a Wisconsin Public Service 
Commission draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for Point Beach, asked 
for an explanation of why NUHOMS and metal casks have a greater potential to 
spread contamination than the Pacific Sierra Nuclear Associates ventilated 
storage cask (VSC) system, VSC-24 cask.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941222-0-00014 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response.

 The specific rationale that forms the basis of the 
statement in the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's draft EIS for Point 
Beach was not documented. The decontamination requirements for the two 
designs are comparable. The VSC-24 DSC is loaded into the ventilated concrete 
cask (VCC) forming the VSC. The VSC is then transported from inside the 
reactor auxiliary building to the storage pad. During moving and storage of 
the VCC, the exterior surface remains clean because it has not been exposed to 
contamination in the spent fuel pool. The NUHOMS DSC is moved in the transfer 
cask from the reactor building to the horizontal storage module in the field. 
Because the transfer cask has been in the spent fuel pool, it may have small 
amounts of external contamination that have the potential to spread during 
transit. However, any potential contamination of this type could not be 
significant. The NRC requires that the limits for surface contamination, 
workers' dose, and environmental dose must all be met for the operation of the 
ISFSI, including during any transfer operations. Each 10 CFR Part 50 licensee 
must have a radiation protection program to monitor operations to ensure that 
surface contamination and worker and public exposure to radiation are below 
acceptable levels and as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). Past 
operation of the NUHOMS shows that the doses are well below all NRC limits. 
B.4. 

Comment.

 One commenter ``is concerned that heat generated by 
fission product decay may provide the driving force, the presence of free 
moisture in water-logged fuel may, in a non-mechanistic way, provide a 
transport mechanism for fission product release and the ambient air 
circulating through the cask concrete structure may provide (an unmonitored) 
pathway to the biosphere.'' One commenter remained concerned about the 
possibility of insufficient drying of the fuel before placement in the DSC. 
Another commenter, citing the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory Report 
PNL-5987 on the removal of moisture from degraded fuel during vacuum drying, 
contends that the mechanism for free moisture and radionuclide release that 
pertain in normal or upset conditions, such as conditions caused by sabotage, 
have not been simulated adequately. 


Response.

 The DSC is a closed vessel. There is no path available 
for release of fission products from inside the DSC to the atmosphere. During 
normal operation, the circulating air, as it passes through the HSM and around 
the outside of the DSC to remove the heat, never comes in contact with 
fission products and therefore, could not remove these products from the 
cavity of the DSC. Moreover, design basis accidents under upset conditions 
were postulated and analyzed in the SAR and SER. These analyses show that the 
heat generated from fission product decay is not capable of breaching the DSC 
and could not provide the driving force for a release of radioactivity. 
Further, it is not expected that any significant amount of moisture will 
remain in the fuel after it is loaded into the DSC. The fuel is dried after 
it has been loaded into the DSC and the topcover plate seal welded to the DSC 
shell. The Certificate of Compliance requires two pump-downs to a vacuum 
pressure of less than 3 mm Hg each with a holding time of greater than 
30 minutes. A stable vacuum pressure of less than 3 mm Hg further assures that 
all liquid water has evaporated in the DSC cavity. 
The safeguards issue of radiological sabotage of storage casks has been 
reviewed previously and assessed in the 1989 proposed rule to add Subparts K 
and L to 10 CFR Part 72 (54 FR 19379). The NRC has determined that the 
Standardized NUHOMS is sufficiently robust such that the effects of a 
successful attack would have low health consequences and are similar to the 
results presented in the 1989 proposed rule. (see also response to comment 
N.1) 
C. A number of comments were received that focused on monitoring, 
surveillance, and inspection activities associated with dry cask storage of 
spent fuel, particularly as they relate to the Standardized NUHOMS. 
C.1. 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that there are neither active nor 
passive systems in place to mitigate barrier breaches, nor are there active 
radiation monitors that would indicate a breach has occurred. There are no 
monitored drains and sumps nor are there retention basins. The commenter 
stated that the cask is insufficient to be relied upon for the health and 
safety of Ohioans. 


Response.

 The Certificate of Compliance (Section 1.3) for the 
Standardized NUHOMS includes surveillance and monitoring requirements that are 
more than sufficient to detect cask degradation in time to ensure that 
adequate corrective actions can and will be taken. In addition, radiation 
monitoring and environmental monitoring programs would detect any radiation 
leak in excess of NRC limits from an NRC-approved cask. 
In some instances, the NRC has required continuous monitoring where it 
is needed to determine when corrective action needs to be taken. Under a 
general license, to date, the NRC has accepted continuous pressure monitoring 
of the inert helium atmosphere as an indicator of acceptable performance of 
mechanical closure seals for dry spent fuel storage casks. 
However, the NRC does not consider continuous monitoring for the 
Standardized NUHOMS double-weld seals to be necessary because:

(1) There are no known long-term degradation mechanisms which would 
cause the seal to fail within the design life of the DSC; and 
(2) The possibility of corrosion has been included in the design (see 
SER Section 3.2.2.5). 
These conditions ensure that the internal helium atmosphere will remain 
stable. Therefore, an individual continuous monitoring device for each HSM is 
not necessary. However, the NRC considers that other forms of monitoring, 
including periodic surveillance, inspection and survey requirements, and 
application of preexisting radiological environmental monitoring programs of 
10 CFR Part 50 during the use of the canisters with seal weld closures can 
adequately satisfy NRC requirements. 
With respect to the use of instrumentation and control systems to 
monitor systems that are important to safety, the user of the Standardized 
NUHOMS will, as provided in Chapter 14 of the SER and in Section 1.3.2 of the 
Certificate of Compliance, be required to verify, the cask thermal performance 
on a daily basis by a temperature measurement, to identify conditions that 
threaten to approach cask design temperature criteria. The cask user will 
also be required to conduct a daily visual surveillance of the cask air inlets 
and outlets as required by Chapter 12 of the SER and Section 1.3.1 of the 
Certificate of Compliance. 
While the HSM and DSC are considered components important to safety, 
they are not considered operating systems in the same sense as spent fuel pool 
cooling water systems or ventilation systems that may require other 
instrumentation and control systems to ensure proper functioning. Due to this 
passive design, temperature monitoring and surveillance activities are 
appropriate and sufficient to assure adequate protection of the public health 
and safety for this design. 
Because the Standardized NUHOMS DSC is welded closed and has been 
decontaminated before being placed in a HSM, there is no routine radioactive 
liquid generation that would require a retention basin or sump. Water 
entering the storage area has no mechanism of becoming contaminated because 
the DSC is enclosed within the HSM and is expected to be dried by the heat 
generated during storage. 
C.2. 

Comment.

 One commenter expressed concern over the possible 
external corrosion of the stainless steel DSC because of exposure to water 
over decades. Another commenter expressed concern about corrosion of 
stainless steel under conditions of indefinite duration, stating that while 
stainless steel corrodes less rapidly than carbon steel, even the plumbing 
fixture industry is finding unexpected stainless steel pitting and corrosion 
under conditions far less intense than those in a DSC. Another commenter 
stated that the system is not designed for remote inspection of the DSC for 
corrosion while it is in the HSM and that the only way to inspect the DSC is 
to return it to the spent fuel pool. Periodic inspection of the DSC is needed 
to preclude or identify gradual canister deterioration by unknown mechanisms. 
Another commenter inquired about a checking system for the NUHOMS in the 
future. How will corrosion be evaluated on the canister (DSC) and the support 
rails inside the HSM? Is it possible for them to accumulate moisture and 
corrode together over possibly many years of storage? What check is required 
on the possibility that the canister couldn't be removed at the end of cask 
life?

Response.

 The DSC is enclosed within the HSM and is not exposed 
to external water. Laboratory experiments have indicated a general corrosion 
rate of less than 0.00001 inches per year for similar stainless steels. The 
NRC believes these experiments more accurately bound DSC corrosion than 
experiences in unrelated industries. For the 50-year design life of the DSC, 
the expected corrosion would therefore not result in exceeding a corrosion 
depth of 0.0005 inches. This will not affect the DSC performing its intended 
safety functions. Because of the low corrosion rates expected for stainless 
steel, periodic inspections for deterioration of the DSC are not considered 
necessary. Therefore, inspections are not required. The support rails for 
the DSC have an extremely hard-alloy steel applied to the sliding surface, are 
ground to a smooth finish, and are coated with a dry film lubricant to prevent 
corrosion and to reduce the coefficient of friction. Furthermore, the 
environment inside the HSM is protected from rain and it is kept dry by the 
heat load from the DSC. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that corrosion 
between the stainless steel and the hard alloy steel surface of the support 
rail will occur to any significant extent. These conclusions and analyses 
regarding the very small likelihood of corrosion indicate that there is 
reasonable assurance that the DSC can be removed from the HSM when required. 
C.3. 

Comment.

 One commenter questioned whether the screens between the casks, which are essential to cooling, will remain clear
of debris and how 
they can be cleaned if they become partially clogged. Another commenter was 
concerned about how the roof screen was inspected, stating that it seems 
likely that insects, animals, and birds will be attracted to the warm air 
coming from the outlet vents. Several commenters remained concerned about 
vent blockage that can completely cover and block screening and vents 
particularly from insects such as paper wasps, that build huge nests, and 
swarms of midges that are common to the Great Lakes. How are the screens 
attached? 


Response.

 As stated in the Certificate of Compliance, a licensee using 
the Standardized NUHOMS must conduct a daily visual surveillance of the 
exterior of air inlets and outlets (front wall and roof bird screen). In 
addition, the licensee must perform a daily close-up inspection to ensure that 
no material accumulates between the modules to block the air flow. If the 
surveillance shows blockage of air vents, the licensee is required to clear 
the vent blockage by following procedures developed by each user of the 
Standardized NUHOMS. If the screen is damaged, the licensee must replace the 
screen. The required daily surveillance and temperature measurements should 
readily detect blockage of the vents or screens by insects, animals, or birds 
in a timely manner, leading to the removal of the obstruction before damage 
occurs from high temperatures. The bird screen is made of stainless steel 
wire cloth tack-welded to stainless steel strips, which are attached to the 
HSM with stainless steel wedge anchors. 
C.4. 

Comment.

 One commenter expressed concern about the presence of 
burrowing and other nuisance animals that have posed problems at other waste 
sites. 


Response.

 Burrowing and other nuisance animals are not expected 
to pose problems for the Standardized NUHOMS. Because of the robust system 
design, animals will not be able to get to the radioactive material or cause 
damage such that water could cause movement of the radioactive material. 
Burrowing under the concrete pad would not cause damage to safety-related 
components. Further, large-scale burrowing would likely be detected by the 
daily surveillance or other activities related to the operation of the storage 
area. 
C.5. 

Comment.

 One commenter wanted additional radiation monitoring 
because of the calculated higher dose rates over previous NUHOMS designs. The 
commenter stated that these higher dose rates are not consistent with the 
objective of maintaining occupational exposures ALARA, and that site-specific 
applications should provide detailed procedures and plans to meet ALARA 
guidelines and 10 CFR Part 20 requirements with respect to operation and 
maintenance. 


Response.

 No additional radiation monitoring has been 
specifically identified or required for the Standardized NUHOMS. However, 
10 CFR Parts 20, 50, and 72 require that licensees comply with ALARA. In 
addition, 10 CFR 72.212(b)(6) requires each licensee to review its radiation 
protection program to determine that their effectiveness is not decreased by 
use of the Standardized NUHOMS. Further, 10 CFR 72.212 (b)(9) requires each 
licensee to conduct storage activities in accordance with appropriate written 
procedures. If the results of these licensee activities indicate that 
additional procedures are required then the licensee is required to implement 
the procedures. 
C.6. 

Comment.

 One commenter was concerned about the optical survey 
equipment used to align the transfer cask with the HSM before transfer. What 
checks are made on this optical equipment and what regulations apply? 


Response.

 The optical equipment used to align the transfer cask 
with the HSM is optional and is an operational convenience. However, the 
licensee must meet Technical Specifications 1.2.9 in the Certificate of 
Compliance. Therefore, only appropriate calibrations or checks to assure 
compliance with this technical specification are appropriate.

C.7. 

Comment. 

One commenter wants to know who evaluates the insertion 
or retrieval of the DSC for excessive vibration and what is the result of 
excessive vibration. Would this allow crud to be released? 



Response. 

The NRC Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.2.9 
provides that the cask user observe the transfer system during DSC insertion 
or retrieval to ensure that motion or excessive vibration does not occur. It 
also prescribes certain follow-up actions to be taken by the cask user in the 
event that alignment tolerances are exceeded and excessive vibration occurs. 
It is possible that excessive vibration could dislodge crud. However, the 
crud would be contained within the DSC and would not be released to the 
atmosphere because the DSC is a sealed vessel. Any opening of the DSC will be 
under controlled conditions that should safely contain the crud and prevent 
its release to the environment. 

C.8. 

Comment. 

Several commenters wanted the NRC to set definite 
methods for the required surveillance and monitoring of NUHOMS, including the 
daily temperature measurements, so that data are uniform and standardized for 
future reference on different modules at different reactor locations. 



Response. 

The NRC Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized 
NUHOMS has required temperature measurements. However, the licensee or vendor 
has latitude in determining how the performance-based temperature requirements 
will be met. The NRC is not convinced that the possible benefits of a 
uniform, but prescriptive, surveillance and monitoring system or technique 
would outweigh the costs of curtailing the freedom of cask users to design an 
implementation scheme suited to their individual needs. The collection of 
uniform data for possible future use, but without a specific regulatory need 
could lead to additional exposure to workers, or adversely affect safety 
without any offsetting benefit. 

C.9. 

Comment. 

One commenter asked about the design life of this 
NUHOMS module and on how this is documented. Will the canister be removed 
from the concrete module at a specific time and be opened? 



Response. 

The design life of the Standardized NUHOMS is 50 years 
as described in the SAR. The Certificate of Compliance has a 20-year approval 
period that can be renewed by NRC for another 20 years following a safety 
reevaluation. It is expected, that at the end of operation, the canister will 
be removed from the concrete module and will be opened in the spent fuel pool 
facility or an adequate dry environment alternative. The fuel will be 
transferred to an NRC-approved shipping cask for off-site transportation and 
ultimate disposal by the DOE. 

C.10. 

Comment. 

One commenter believed it prudent to monitor 
temperature and air flow to ensure that temperature excursions are not 
experienced. 



Response. 

NRC believes the required temperature measurement 
stated in Specification 1.3.2 of the Certificate of Compliance, plus the daily 
visual inspection of HSM air inlets and outlets, are adequate to ensure that 
temperature excursions exceeding the design basis are not experienced and to 
determine when corrective action needs to be taken to maintain safe storage 
conditions. Therefore, air flow measurements are not required to assure 
safety.

D. A number of commenters raised technical issues related to the 
thermal analysis of the Standardized NUHOMS and thermal performance of the 
system under normal, off-normal, and accident conditions. 

D.1. 

Comment. 

Several commenters wanted, in the interest of ALARA 
principles, the capacity for approximately 24 kW heat removal to be verified 
by using an artificial heat load. One commenter suggested that the NUHOMS be 
tested with a full heat load at a testing site such as Idaho National 
Engineering Laboratory (INEL), and not at each reactor site that may load it 
with a higher heat generation rate fuel. Another commenter cited the ALARA 
philosophy of loading the oldest fuel first even though design basis fuel is 
on site. Several commenters wanted deletion of the requirement (a literal 
interpretation of draft Certificate of Compliance) to calculate the 
temperature rise for each HSM loaded with canisters producing less than the 
design limit of 24 kW for the following reasons: 

(1) Users are not normally provided the vendor's analytical models for 
this calculation, 

(2) The 100 
 F rise calculated for the design basis maximum heat load 
ensures that all safety limits are met for concrete and fuel, 

(3) Because 24 kW is the limit, virtually all the HSMs will be 
affected, which places an undue burden on the user to ``baseline'' the predicted delta-T by calculation considering
the inherent safety margins of the system, and 

(4) Technical Specification 1.3.1 ensures that air flow is not blocked 
so a false measurement of low temperature rise cannot occur. 



Response. 

A licensee is not required by NRC to load the oldest 
fuel first but, in the interest of ALARA, it may do so. However, each time 
hotter fuel is loaded up to the maximum allowed in a DSC, the licensee would 
need to verify the heat removal performance of the system. For fuel producing 
less heat than the design limits of the system, the heat removal capacity of 
the system determined by calculation must be verified by temperature 
measurements. This process must be repeated each time a DSC is loaded with 
hotter fuel until the maximum-system designed heat load is reached. When 
loaded with spent fuel producing 24 kW heat, the system may not have an 
ambient and vent outlet temperature difference of more than 100 
 F for fuel 
cooled equal to or more than 5 years. This verification process is required 
to confirm that the as-built system of each licensee is performing as 
designed. A licensee could use an artificial heat source to test an initial 
cask at a bounding heat load of 24 kW before loading fuel. However, this test 
would only verify the spent fuel heat removal capacity of the system. It 
would not verify as-built performance. Experience has shown that adequate 
verification testing can be performed at the reactor site. Therefore, 
performing the verification at a testing site like INEL would not provide 
additional safety margins. 

D.2. 

Comment. 

Several commenters pointed out possible conflicting 
statements about temperature measurements in the surveillance requirements. 
In discussions about the heat removal capacity test, temperatures are 
determined only during the test period. Daily temperature measurements on 
each HSM are required to verify thermal performance. 



Response. 

These two temperature measurement programs have 
different objectives. Temperature measurements by licensees to verify the 
heat capacity calculations need only be done until equilibrium is reached. 
The daily temperature measurements by licensees are intended to demonstrate 
continued safe operation within specified limits over the life of the HSM and 
may not be the same type of measurement done in the initial period to verify 
heat removal capacity. 

D.3. 

Comment. 

One commenter was concerned about the adequacy of 
cooling under all atmospheric conditions in the country. The commenter cited 
conditions such as humidity over 90 percent, temperature over 100 
 F, and no 
wind. 



Response. 

Regulatory requirements for general licensee users of 
dry storage casks are contained in 10 CFR 72.212(b). Each user must verify 
that the following conditions are not exceeded at their reactor site for the 
Standardized NUHOMS: the maximum average yearly temperature with solar 
incidence is 70 
 F; the average daily temperature is 100 
 F; and the maximum 
temperature is 125 
 F with incident solar radiation. If the power reactor 
site high temperature parameters fall within these criteria, the Standardized 
NUHOMS can be safely used at the site. 

D.4. 

Comment. 

One commenter wants the NRC to establish procedures to 
measure temperature performance, especially the thermal performance of an 
individual module and not the combined performance of adjacent modules as 
stated on page A-23 of the draft Certificate of Compliance. 



Response. 

As required by the regulations, the licensees are 
required to develop detailed procedures. NRC in its regulatory oversite role 
has the opportunity to review the adequacy of the procedures. The requirement 
cited by the commenter is a requirement for the licensee to verify a 
temperature measurement of the thermal performance for each HSM, not the 
combined performance of adjacent modules. A cautionary statement is included 
in the basis of the specification to ensure that licensee measurements of air 
temperatures reflect only the thermal performance of an individual module and 
not the combined performance of adjacent modules.

D.5. 

Comment.

 One commenter wanted to know how the temperature 
differences in the roof, side wall, and floor areas are incorporated into the 
daily temperature measurement. 



Response.

 For the first HSM to be emplaced, the user is required 
to measure the air inlet and air outlet temperature difference of the system 
at equilibrium. This measurement is to ensure that the heat capacity of the 
system will not be exceeded and that the concrete temperature criteria will 
not be exceeded. For the Standardized NUHOMS, this maximum heat capacity is 
24 kW. The 24 kW heat load is the design maximum and is the basis for the 
thermal hydraulic calculations for the cask. The temperature distribution for 
various parts of the HSM have been calculated (i.e., the roof, walls, and 
floor) by the cask vendor. Temperature differences causing thermal stresses 
in the concrete were evaluated and are duly reported in both the SAR and SER. 
These calculations were reviewed by NRC as a part of the overall process for 
this design approval. 


D.6. 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that daily temperature measurements are not necessary to ensure convective air flow, given
the requirement to verify that the inlets and outlets are not obstructed. Site-specific NUHOMS require temperature
measurements when the DSC is placed into the HSM, 24 hours later, and again at 1 week after loading to ensure adequate
thermal performance. 



Response.

 The NRC disagrees with this comment. The HSM and DSC 
are considered components important to safety in the Standardized NUHOMS. 
Daily temperature measurements of the thermal performance by the licensee are 
required to provide additional assurance that thermal limits are not exceeded 
under the general license. This requirement was imposed on the first cask of 
this type approved by the NRC and listed in 10 CFR 72.214 for use by a general 
licensee, the VSC-24 cask (58 FR 17967; April 7, 1994) and is now applied to 
the Standardized NUHOMS. 

E. A number of commenters expressed concern about emergency planning 
and response contingencies. 

E.1. 

Comment.

 Several commenters expressed concern that in the event 
of problems and the need to off-load fuel (as in the recent situation at 
Palisades), a transfer cask may not be available in a timely manner because of 
inclement weather or because the transfer cask itself has experienced problems 
or is being used elsewhere. One commenter expressed concern at having to have 
a transfer cask on site within 40 hours of vent blockage to prevent concrete 
damage. If the transfer cask is leased from VECTRA and is not at the 
licensee's site, who is liable if something happens that would require the use 
of a transfer cask? 



Response.

 The NRC has analyzed all design basis accidents from 
the operation of an ISFSI and concluded that there will be no release of 
radioactive material to the environment. The 40-hour limit on vent blockage 
is intended to prevent concrete degradation that might occur over a long 
period of storage. A vent blockage accident would not result in the release 
of radioactive material because the DSC would not be breached. Therefore, the 
NRC believes that the potential risk to the public health and safety is 
extremely small during the time needed to obtain the use of a transfer cask. 
Thus, there is no requirement that a transfer cask be at an ISFSI site all the 
time. 

E.2. 

Comment.

 One commenter expressed concern that the effects of 
tornado winds and missiles during movement of the fuel in a transfer cask or 
in a storage cask on a transporter were not analyzed. 



Response.

 Both the vendor's SAR and NRC staff's SER address the 
effects of tornado winds and missiles during movement of the transfer cask 
with a loaded canister. These analyses show that, for tornado winds, there is 
a safety factor of 1.5 against overturning when subjected to Design Basis 
Tornado winds (a safety factor greater than 1 will generally be adequate for 
public protection). The transfer cask stability, tornado missile penetration 
resistance, and shell and end plate stresses were calculated and shown to be 
below the allowable stresses for ASME BPVC Service Level D (accident) 
stresses. 

E.3. 

Comment.

 One commenter described an October 1972 storm that 
flooded the entire Davis-Besse plant site, including the (pre-operational) 
reactor building. There has been subsequent flooding of the site, 
particularly during spring thaws.

Response.

 Safety analyses by NRC and the cask vendor show the 
Standardized NUHOMS can withstand floods and will continue to perform 
acceptably. With regard to the Davis-Besse site, the licensee changed site 
topography during plant construction. Specifically, the area was built up and 
some dikes were added. The plant structure's ground floor elevation is 
585 feet International Great Lakes Datum (IGLD), which is also the elevation 
of the pad. The licensing design basis for maximum probable static water 
level on the site is 583.7 feet IGLD. As noted, the HSM and DSC were 
evaluated for flood conditions as required by 10 CFR 72.122(b). The HSM can 
withstand a maximum water velocity of 15 feet per second and a static head of 
50 feet of water. The DSC can withstand a static head of 50 feet of water. 
Any site that intends to use a Standardized NUHOMS design must evaluate the 
conditions at their site to verify compatibility with the design 
specifications of the system. 

F. A number of commenters raised issues relating to the design, 
evaluation, and operation of the Standardized NUHOMS. 

F.1 

Comment.

 Several comments related to the fuel to be stored in the 
Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter wanted control components contained in 
assemblies addressed in the SAR and SER citing DOE acceptance criteria. One 
commenter questioned how 55,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel now being used in 
pressurized water reactors will be handled since the Standardized NUHOMS-24 is 
rated to handle only 40,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel. Another commenter, citing 
provisions of current site-specific licensees for other NUHOMS designs, stated 
that higher burnup should be allowed if the decay heat and radiological source 
terms are within limits. Another commenter asserted that increased fission 
products from higher enriched fuel may potentially increase embrittlement of 
the fuel cladding and that this needs to be evaluated in the SER. This 
commenter further alleged that this would increase the probability of more 
defective fuel being loaded into dry casks. 



Response.

 The vendor designed the cask system for storage of 
pressurized water or boiling water reactor fuel assemblies meeting certain 
specifications. By limiting the use of the cask system to assemblies meeting 
these specifications, the vendor made a decision that may partially restrict 
the use of the cask. However, the NRC does not require that a cask be 
universal for all types of fuel or be usable at every reactor site. For 
example, none of the casks previously listed in 10 CFR 72.214 is usable for 
boiling water reactor spent fuel. 

Currently, the 55,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel and fuel with initial 
enrichments of greater than 4% will have to remain in the spent fuel pool 
because dry spent fuel cask designs to store fuel with this higher burnup and 
initial enrichment or related to DOE acceptance criteria have not yet been 
reviewed and evaluated by the NRC. 

F.2 

Comment.

 Several comments were related to criticality safety 
analysis. One commenter questioned the conservatism of using 7.5-year cooled 
spent fuel when 5-year-cooled fuel is the minimum specified and when older 
fuel may also be stored in the cask. Another inquired about criticality 
safety if the original basket geometry were compromised, as might be the case 
for brittle failure of a spacer disk. In the compromised basket geometry 
case, the commenter also asked about the difference in criticality safety for 
a helium atmosphere rather than a borated water medium. The commenter, 
referring to July 24, 1992, meeting minutes, inquired why all parties agreed 
not to spend any resources to make these criticality safety calculations. 



Response.

 The Standardized NUHOMS nuclear criticality safety analysis 
is based on the following: (1) Babcock and Wilcox 15  x  15/208 pin fuel 
assemblies with initial enrichments up to 4.0 wt% of U-235 and (2) General 
Electric 7  x  7 fuel assemblies with initial enrichments up to 4.0 wt% of 
U-235, for the Standardized NUHOMS-24P and NUHOMS-52B designs respectively. 
The age of the fuel that will actually be stored is not relevant in 
criticality safety analysis because the analysis assumes storage of 
unirradiated fresh fuel that is more reactive than cooled spent fuel. The 
Standardized NUHOMS-24P system has administrative controls that limit the 
irradiated fuel reactivity to less than or equal to 1.45 wt% of U-235 
equivalent unirradiated fuel (Certificate of Compliance Section 1.2.1). 

The possibility of a criticality accident caused by the brittle failure 
of the basket should not be a significant concern. No lifting or handling of 
the DSC outside the spent fuel pool building is permitted if the basket 
temperature is lower than 0
 F. If the user does not determine the actual 
basket temperature, the ambient temperature must be used conservatively. 
Under these temperature restrictions, the basket materials will not behave in 
a brittle fashion. Consequently, the basket geometry would not be compromised 
by brittle failure. As for the criticality safety consideration related to a 
helium atmosphere versus a borated water medium, the k

eff

 of the fuel in a helium atmosphere is much less than the k

eff

 in borated water. Therefore, criticality calculations for the borated water are sufficient because they are more
conservative and therefore would bound calculations using a helium atmosphere. 

F.3 

Comment.

 Two commenters were concerned with shielding and dose 
assessments for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter believed that using 
10-year-cooled fuel for the dose assessment was nonconservative when 5-year-
cooled fuel is needed to load the DSC to produce 24 kW of heat. Another, 
referring to an NRC meeting with Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (PNFSI), 
wanted clarification of an NRC request to delete a clause allowing the utility 
to perform site-specific shielding calculations.

Response.

 The cask vendor presented dose assessment results in the SAR 
for both 5- and 10-year-cooled fuel. However, for this rulemaking, NRC used 
the dose assessment for 5-year-cooled fuel for the shielding analysis 
radiation source term and for accidental releases of radionuclide material. 
NRC's use of the 5-year-cooled fuel assessment is conservative and bounding. 
To ensure safe storage of spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks, the 
NRC specifies, in Section 1.2.1 of the Certificate of Compliance a number of 
fuel acceptance parameters. These parameters, which may include burnup, 
initial enrichment, heat load, cooling time, and radiological source term, 
define the properties of those assemblies that can be stored in a cask. One 
such parameter of interest for the Standardized NUHOMS is the radiological 
source term that forms the basis of the shielding analyses. For this 
parameter, the vendor proposed an alternative approach. Specifically, for 
fuel assemblies that fall outside the specified source term parameters but 
satisfy all other parameters, the vendor proposed to allow licensees to do 
individual cask shielding calculations to show compliance with the design 
basis dose rates. This could result in more assemblies in a licensee's 
inventory that would be eligible for dry storage. In the instance noted in 
the comment, the NRC did not agree with the vendor proposal. The Certificate 
of Compliance dose rate specifications provide a simple check to ensure that 
DSCs are not inadvertently loaded with the wrong fuel. The dose rate 
specifications are based on the shielding analyses provided by the vendor in 
its SAR. Because of differences in non-fuel components in the ends of some 
assemblies, dose rates higher than those evaluated by NRC in the SER may occur 
at the ends of casks than were assumed in the shielding analysis. The 
Certificate of Compliance specifications allow for this possibility and permit 
the licensee to store such fuel provided the licensee verifies proper cask 
fabrication, conformance with all other fuel parameters, and compliance with 
radiation protection requirements. The site-specific calculations referred to 
in the comment are not shielding calculations, but rather are the licensee's 
written evaluations (or dose assessments) required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(2)(iii) 
to establish that the radiation criteria for ISFSI in 10 CFR 72.104 have been 
met. The Certificate of Compliance also requires that the licensee submit a 
letter report to the NRC summarizing its actions in this type of case. 
F.4. 

Comment.

 Several commenters were concerned with fuel clad 
integrity issues. Particularly, they were concerned with potential problems 
that may arise because of differences between vertical and horizontal storage. 
One commenter noted that it was essential to inspect the cladding carefully 
for the minute hairline cracks which would allow the radioactivity inside to 
escape. Another commenter wanted it made clear that for fuel to be eligible 
for storage it doesn't need to be specifically inspected nor require special 
handling or storage provisions within the spent fuel pool. The commenter also 
asserted that pinhole leaks in fuel rod cladding do not constitute gross 
breaches. The commenter wanted fuel cladding integrity clarified. Another 
commenter claimed that horizontal storage of fuel rods will lead to cladding 
deterioration that would challenge the technical specifications of the NUHOMS 
cask. Another commenter was concerned about the possibility of fuel rod 
bowing that could result in weighted contact between the fuel cladding/crud 
and the DSC guide sleeve, with the potential for eventual bonding of the 
materials over the duration of the storage period. One commenter, noting that 
some of the fuel in the spent fuel pools could be nearly 20 years old, was 
concerned that the fuel will not be tested for leaks using specific techniques 
such as penetrating dyes, eddy current, sipping, or ultrasound before canister 
loading. A commenter wanted all fuel with known defects and all water-logged 
fuel retained in the spent fuel pool until the cask integrity under operating 
conditions is fully demonstrated. Another wanted to know how ``grossly 
breached'' fuel will be ultimately handled and shipped off site. 


Response.

 In the Standardized NUHOMS, PWR fuel rods are stored in a 
horizontal orientation and do not normally deflect in the middle of any span 
so that the rods contact the DSC guide sleeve. However, the possibility 
exists that a bowed rod may come in contact with the guide sleeve. 
With respect to storage of BWR fuel, the fuel channel that surrounds the 
fuel bundle (rods) provides a barrier to separate coolant flow paths, to guide 
the control rod, and to provide rigidity and protection for the fuel bundle 
during handling. Therefore, the BWR fuel rods inside the channel do not come 
in contact with the guide sleeves. Even if there were contact with either PWR 
or BWR fuel rods, the interaction would not present a significant concern 
because the guide sleeve material is stainless steel, which has a very low 
rate of corrosion, and the DSC cavity is evacuated and back-filled with inert 
helium, which further reduces the likelihood of any corrosion or bonding 
involving the guide sleeve and fuel rods.

The Certificate of Compliance requires that the fuel have no known or 
suspected gross cladding breaches to ensure the structural integrity of the 
fuel. Known or suspected failed fuel assemblies (rods) and fuel with cladding 
defects greater than pin holes and hairline cracks are not authorized in the 
Standardized NUHOMS. Fuel meeting this specification will be safely stored 
and will remain intact in storage because the dry inert atmosphere and 
relatively low temperature will prevent deterioration of the cladding. 
Grossly breached fuel will be handled in site-specific license applications.

Comment.

 Quite a few comments related to the structural stability 
of the HSM, particularly its response to earthquakes. Commenters questioned 
the possibility of vertical storage of the Standardized NUHOMS and suggested 
that it would be very difficult to restrain the HSM if the DSC were in a 
vertical position. One commenter wanted dry storage casks constructed to 
Building Officials Code Administrators (BOCA) National Building Code (and Ohio 
Administrative Code) for structures in use group H-4, high hazard use, which 
includes radioactive materials. Commenters questioned whether ground 
acceleration as used by the NRC in its evaluation could adequately describe 
all potential earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountain Front and suggested that 
a ground acceleration of 2.5g would not be realistic for all sites, despite 
proximity to fault lines. Another commenter alleged a number of seismic 
events in the midwest which had some effect in the Ohio area could cause a 
complete failure of the cask and requested that the NRC insist that the cask, 
containment structure, and foundation pad be designed to substantially exceed 
all earthquakes with a potential for 0.60g. One commenter wanted to know if 
the module had been analyzed for earthquake events at all United States 
reactor sites, according to Laurand Findmun Seismic Hazard Curves. Other 
commenters expressed various concerns about the integrity and reaction of the 
Standardized NUHOMS components under earthquake conditions and asked the 
following questions: 
Could the casks crash against each other as the ground moves beneath 
them? 
Could the module shift, crack, or move off the pad? 
How are the rail support holdings evaluated? 
Could the DSC be knocked off the rails? and 
Could the module roof crack and fall on the canister? 


Response.

 The Standardized NUHOMS design described in the 
vendor's applications for approval and the SAR does not address vertical 
storage. Consequently, NRC neither evaluated nor approved vertical storage 
for the system. Therefore, it may not be stored vertically. 
The NRC reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS for compliance with design 
criteria that are more stringent than those of the BOCA National Building Code 
(NBC) (see response to Comment A.5). These more stringent criteria are 
included in national standards that more closely represent the use of the 
Standardized NUHOMS. 
Part 72 specifies a design basis maximum ground acceleration of 0.25g 
for areas east of the Rocky Mountain Front that are not in areas of known 
seismic activity. All HSMs and DSCs are designed to withstand a 0.25g 
earthquake. Any reactor licensee who intends to use the Standardized NUHOMS 
must verify that the maximum displacements at the cask's location on the 
reactor site are within the design criteria for the system. The Standardized 
NUHOMS is free standing and not dependent on the pad for safety. Failure of 
the pad caused by seismic events will not cause the Standardized NUHOMS to 
fail. Therefore, cask safety does not require the pad to be designed to 
withstand a seismic event. 
F.6. 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that the SAR did not include 
consideration of the accident events such as: aircraft crashes, turbine 
missiles, external fires, explosions, and sabotage.

Response. 

Before using the Standardized NUHOMS, the general 
licensee must evaluate them to ensure the site is encompassed by the design 
bases of the approved cask. The events listed in the comment are among the 
site-specific considerations that must be evaluated. 


The site evaluation for a nuclear plant considers the effects of nearby 
transportation and military activities. It is incumbent upon the user of the 
cask to determine if the SER for the facility encompasses the design basis 
analysis performed for the Standardized NUHOMS or any certified cask. The 
great majority of the aircraft are single-engine propeller airplanes which 
typically weigh on the order of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds. The cask's inherent 
design will withstand tornado missiles and other design loads and also 
provides protection from the collision forces imposed by these light general 
aviation aircraft without adverse consequences. NUREG-800, Section 3.5.1.6 
``Standard Review Plan for Light Water Reactors,'' contains methods and 
acceptance criteria for determining if the probability of an accident 
involving larger aircraft (both Military and civilian) exceeds the acceptable 
criterion. It is incumbent upon the licensee to determine whether or not the 
reactor site parameters are enveloped by the cask design basis as required by 
10 CFR 72.212(b)(3). These would include an evaluation demonstrating that the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.106 have been met. 

Turbine missile analyses typically show a very low probability of a 
turbine missile breaking the turbine casing. The site's turbine missile 
analyses must be considered as part of the facility's analysis of the 
suitability of the storage location. External fires are handled by 
established fire control programs. Explosions are prevented by control of 
combustibles under the licensee's fire protection program. Sabotage is 
considered under the criteria for security programs that each licensee must 
implement. (See also response to comment N.1). 


F.7. 

Comment. 

Several commenters raised issues about the pad and 
foundation for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter referred to a previous 
rulemaking that stated that the NUHOMS casks required site-specific approvals 
because they are constructed in place. Other commenters, concerned with 
seismic events at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station and soil stability 
issues similar to cask use at the Palisades Plant, asserted that there was a 
necessary relationship of the Standardized NUHOMS cask or module to the pad at 
a specific site and that evaluation of it could not be based on the reactor 
site seismic analysis. Each site required singular seismic and soil analysis 
for dynamic loads and not just static loads. 


Response. 

The NUHOMS design referred to in the July 18, 1990, 
55 FR 29181, rulemaking includes the site-specific pad as an integral part of 
the concrete HSM and therefore it is important to safety. The Standardized 
NUHOMS considered in this rulemaking have the HSMs as free-standing units; 
that is, they have no structural connections to the pad. The Standardized 
NUHOMS does not rely on the pad to perform a safety function to protect public 
health and safety. The vendor analyzed the HSM containing the DSC for peak 
ground accelerations of 0.25g caused by earthquakes and found that it would 
neither slide nor overturn. NRC evaluated the Standardized NUHOMS under a 
wide range of site conditions that could diminish cask safety. Further, under 
the NRC general license, before using the Standardized NUHOMS a licensee must 
verify that reactor site parameters are within the envelope of conditions 
reviewed by NRC for the cask approval. If potential conditions exist at the 
reactor site (including potential erosion, soil instability, or earthquakes) 
that could unacceptably diminish cask safety by any credible means, the 
licensee's analysis must include an evaluation of the potential conditions to 
verify that impairment of cask safety is highly unlikely. 


The NRC's regulations do not explicitly require a licensee using a cask 
under a general license to evaluate the cask storage pad and foundation under 
such site conditions for erosion or earthquakes. If conditions at the reactor 
site could unacceptably diminish cask safety by affecting the stability of the 
supporting foundation so as to put the cask in an unsafe condition, the cask 
may not be used unless the foundation is appropriately modified or a suitable 
location at the reactor site is found. Implicitly, therefore, the pad and the 
underlying foundation materials must be analyzed under site conditions that 
include erosion, soil instability, and earthquakes, even though the pad has no 
direct safety function and the cask is designed to retain its integrity even 
assuming the occurrence of a range of site conditions. 

The licensee has the responsibility under the general license to 
evaluate the match between reactor site parameters and the range of site 
conditions (i.e., the envelope) reviewed by NRC for an approved cask. 
Typically, the licensee will have a substantial amount of information already 
assembled in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) for the nuclear reactor. 
In addition, the envelope for the approved cask is identified in the NRC SER 
and Certificate of Compliance and in the cask vendor's SAR for the cask. Of 
course, the licensee should consider whether the envelope evaluated by NRC 
adequately encompasses the actual location of the cask at the reactor site. 
The licensee should also consider whether there are any site conditions 
associated with the actual cask location that could affect cask design and 
that were not evaluated in the NRC safety evaluation for the cask.

The vendor analyzed the DSC and the HSM for rigid body response (i.e., 
sliding and overturning) to seismic accelerations. The resultant peak 
horizontal ground acceleration is 0.37g and the peak vertical acceleration is 
0.17g. The margin of safety against sliding is 1.35. Similarly, the design 
seismic force will not cause the HSM to tip over because the stabilizing 
moment of the HSM is greater than the seismic overturning moment. The margin 
of safety against overturning is 1.26. Thus, no sliding or overturning of the 
HSM or DSC will occur from the design earthquake. 

Because the pad is not considered a safety-related item, a specific pad 
design is not being approved in this rulemaking for the Standardized NUHOMS. 

F.8. 

Comment. 

A few commenters had questions pertaining to the 
operation of and procedures for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter 
inquired whether just one module of the Standardized NUHOMS could be purchased 
by a utility, or whatever number of modules desired could be procured and 
easily added like singular casks. One commenter expressed concern about snow 
removal procedures to prevent blockage of the bottom vents by drifting snow. 
Another commenter wanted NRC to establish a procedure and criteria for dose 
rates discussed on pages A-15 and A-16 in the draft Certificate of Compliance. 
Several commenters noted that a procedure for opening a storage cask and 
removing the fuel has not been tried before nor documented in the rulemaking. 
They were also concerned that unloading of a cask would place workers at 
higher risk. 



Response. 

The NRC Certificate of Compliance does not permit or limit 
the number of NUHOMS modules that may be purchased by a general license. The 
NRC does not regulate the commercial arrangements between the cask vendor and the users including any provisions
on the number of casks that can be 
purchased or added to the Standardized NUHOMS. 

Under the Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.3, the user of the 
Standardized NUHOMS (general licensee) is required to conduct a visual 
surveillance of the exterior of air inlets and outlets. If the surveillance 
shows blockage of air vents, they must be cleaned in accordance with proper 
procedures. These procedures will minimize the potential impact to the health 
and safety of workers. The daily temperature measurements indicate proper 
thermal performance. 

The Certificate of Compliance requires each licensee to develop 
procedures to implement the dose criteria prescribed on pages A-15 and A-16. 
On page A-15 of the Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.26, the dose rate 
criteria to be met is equal to or less than: (a) 200 mrem/hr. at the top 
shield plug surface at centerline with water in the cavity; and (b) 400 
mrem/hr. at the top cover plate surface at centerline without water in the 
cavity. On page A-16 of the Certificate of Compliance the dose rate criteria 
is less than or equal to: (a) 400 mrem/hr. at 3 feet from the HSM surface; 
(b) 100 mrem/hr. outside of the HSM door on center line of the DSC; and (c) 20 
mrem/hr. at the end shield wall exterior. Each licensee is required to 
develop its own procedures to implement these criteria. In addition, each 
licensee must develop operational procedures for the ISFSI for workers' 
radiation exposure to be ALARA. 

For the Standardized NUHOMS, removal of spent fuel from the DSC is 
addressed in Chapter 5 of the SAR and in Chapter 11 of the SER. The process 
is essentially the reverse of loading operations and would be performed under 
the reactor license radiation protection program. The Certificate of 
Compliance requires each user to develop written procedures for these 
operations and includes precautions to be considered for unloading. ALARA is 
required to be addressed by 10 CFR Part 20. Specification 1.1.6 of the 
Certificate of Compliance requires that pre-operational testing and training 
exercises include the opening of a DSC and returning the DSC and transfer cask 
to the spent fuel pool. The Certificate of Compliance also requires the 
training program to include off-normal events. 

F.9. 

Comment. 

One commenter, citing the May 1993 study prepared for 
the NRC by the Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses of San Antonio, 
Texas, questioned the relatively higher temperature consequences of dry 
storage on fuel cladding. The report states that, ``the dry environment has 
the potential of producing such problems as further fuel cladding oxidation, 
increased cladding stresses, and creep deformation as a result of rod internal 
pressure * * *. These possible spent fuel and cladding alteration modes could be 
quite accelerated under dry storage conditions, since temperatures are much 
higher than in wet storage.'' The commenter does not believe that NRC is 
fulfilling its obligation in 10 CFR 72.122(h) to see that ``spent fuel cladding 
must be protected during storage against degradation that leads to gross 
rupture.''

Response

. The May 1993 study addresses the long-term geological 
disposal of high-level waste (spent fuel) and is not directed to the short-term interim storage of spent fuel at nuclear
power plants. The report 
evaluates processes over 10,000 years of repository performance for geological 
disposal. The conclusions of the report are not applicable for the interim 
storage period of a 20-year cask certificate during which spent fuels stored 
in the DSC have to meet the NRC's criteria to ensure that cladding is 
protected. Under normal operation of the ISFSI, leakage of radionuclides is 
not expected to occur. The design and the double-seal welding of the DSC 
covers are checked and tested to provide structural integrity throughout the 
approved storage period. During normal storage conditions, the licensee is 
required to conduct a radiation monitoring program to ensure protection of 
workers and the safety of the general public. 
G. A number of comments were related to broad policy and program 
issues in connection with the storage and disposal of high-level radioactive 
waste, including the DOE repository program. Some commenters questioned the 
use of dry cask storage and technology in general. Some commenters stated 
that only dry storage casks that would be compatible with DOE interim or final 
repository operations, including transportation, should be approved for use 
under a general license. 
G.1. 

Comment

. One commenter does not want any more casks approved 
until a permanent Federal repository is opened. The wet fuel pool is a proven 
technology that has been successful in containing radioactivity. Another 
commenter stated that dry storage is dangerous. 


Response

. The NRC, in implementing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act 
of 1982, has an obligation to review dry storage technologies and to determine 
whether to approve the use of these technologies for the storage of spent fuel 
if they meet applicable safety requirements. The July 18, 1990, 55 FR 29181, 
rulemaking found that spent fuel stored in dry storage casks designed to meet 
the NRC regulatory requirements can safely contain radioactivity. This 
rulemaking adds one cask design that meets the safety requirements previously 
developed to the list of approved casks. The previous responses to comments, 
as well as the detailed safety and environmental analyses underlying this 
rulemaking (and described elsewhere in this notice), all reveal that the 
Standardized NUHOMS will conform to the NRC requirements and that its use 
should not pose the potential for significant environmental impacts. 
DOE is required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept spent 
fuel for ultimate disposal. Moreover, the Commission made a generic 
determination in its waste Compliance Decisions (September 18, 1990, 
55 FR 38474 and August 31, 1994, 49 FR 34658) that safe disposal is 
technically feasible and will be available within the first quarter of the 
21st century. 
Dry cask storage has significant advantages over wet storage in that the 
system is passive and requires minimal human intervention. No pumps, filters, 
or water quality monitoring are needed to maintain the conditions necessary 
for wet storage. The only monitoring required for the Standardized NUHOMS is 
daily temperature monitoring and visually checking inlet and outlet vents. 
G.2. 

Comment

. A number of commenters wanted a full formal trial-type 
public hearing on the use of the NUHOMS cask.

Response

. Consistent with the applicable procedure, the NRC does 
not intend to hold formal trial-type public hearings on the Standardized 
NUHOMS rule or separate hearings at each reactor site before the use of the 
dry cask technology approved by the Commission in this rulemaking. Rulemaking 
procedures, used by the NRC for generic approval of the Standardized NUHOMS, 
including the underlying NRC staff technical reviews and the opportunity for 
public input, are more than adequate to obtain public input and assure 
protection of the public health and safety and the environment. In this 
rulemaking, the NRC has taken additional steps to elicit and fully consider 
public comments on the Standardized NUHOMS technology. These steps included 
NRC participation in public meetings near Davis-Besse and extension of the 
public comment period by 45 days in response to public requests. This 
extension provided a total public comment period of almost 4 months. 
Section 133 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 authorizes the NRC 
to approve spent fuel storage technologies by rulemaking. When it adopted the 
generic process in 1990 for the review and approval of dry cask storage 
technologies, the Commission stated that ``casks * * * [are to] be approved 

by rulemaking

 and any safety issues that are connected with the casks are 
properly addressed in that rulemaking rather than in a hearing procedure'' 
(July 18, 1990; 55 FR 29181). Rulemaking under NRC rules of practice, 
described in 10 CFR 2.804 and 2.805, provides full opportunity for expression 
of public views but does not use formal trial-type hearings of the kind 
requested by commenters. 
In this proceeding, rulemaking clearly provided adequate avenues for 
members of the public to provide their views regarding NRC's proposed approval 
of the Standardized NUHOMS, including the opportunity to participate through 
the submission of statements, information, data, opinions and arguments. In 
this connection, technical evaluations for Standardized NUHOMS and detailed 
documented findings of compliance with NRC safety, security, and environmental 
requirements were prepared by the NRC staff for public examination. In 
November 1993, the NRC staff reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS and approved the 
design for the purpose of initiating this rulemaking to grant a generic 
approval of the design. In addition, the NRC staff conducted a second review 
in response to the public comments on the Standardized NUHOMS in this 
rulemaking, again finding compliance with NRC requirements as discussed in 
this document. 
In addition to reviewing systematically and in depth the technical 
issues important to protecting public health and safety, and the environment, 
the NRC has taken extra steps to obtain and fully consider public views on the 
Standardized NUHOMS technology and has made every effort to respond to public 
concerns and questions about the Standardized NUHOMS compliance with NRC 
safety, security, and environmental requirements. The initial public comment 
period opened on June 2, 1994, and was scheduled to close on August 16, 1994. 
On August 29, 1994, the public comment period was extended to September 30, 
1994. The NRC also participated in an earlier meeting near the Davis-Besse 
site. 
Under these circumstances, formal hearings would not appreciably add to 
NRC's efforts to ensure adequate protection of public health, safety, and the 
environment and they are unnecessary to NRC's full understanding and 
consideration of public views on the Standardized NUHOMS. 
G.3. 

Comment

. One commenter stated that because there is not now and 
there may not be a permanent high-level radioactive waste (HLWR) repository 
for commercial reactor fuel, and since the NUHOMS 24P and 52B casks are non- 
transportable, any distinction between so called ``temporary storage'' and 
``permanent disposal'' of this waste is moot. Because of the lack of a 
permanent repository or Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) in the foreseeable 
future, a case of a serious spill and the resultant contamination at an 
environmentally unsuitable site like Davis-Besse where ``short and long-term 
adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of (a) 
floodplain * * * potential release of radioactive material during the lifetime of the ISFSI * * *
(and location) over an aquifer which is a major water resource'' have been inadequately dealt with. 


Response

. This rulemaking to certify the Standardized NUHOMS is 
for interim storage of spent fuel in an approved cask for 20 years. It does 
not authorize or approve the ultimate disposal in a permanent HLRW repository, 
which is under the responsibility of the DOE. During interim storage, the 
user (holder of a Part 50 license) must protect the spent fuel against design 
basis threats, and against environmental conditions and natural phenomena such 
as tornadoes, tornado missiles, earthquakes, and floods. In regard to 
flooding, the Certificate of Compliance has a provision (see A-2 of 
Certificate of Compliance) for flood condition analysis to ensure that there 
is no release of radioactive material from flooding.

Comment. 

One commenter stated that projected future uses of land 
and water within the region are impossible to make given the unknown length of 
time this waste may remain on site and the options for both cask and reactor 
license renewal beyond 20 and 40 years, respectively, and the fact that no 
known man-made structure can last for the length of time that this waste must 
be isolated from humans and the environment. If an MRS or repository ever 
become available, this waste may have to be repacked. Each handling of this 
waste increases the likelihood of an accident, spill, contamination, and 
worker and public exposures. 


Response. 

Projected future land and water use can be made based 
on the continued safe operation of a reactor and its associated dry cask 
storage facility. The continued operation of these facilities should have no 
greater impact on land and water use in the future than they do today. As 
previously noted, the NRC Waste Confidence decisions concluded there is 
reasonable assurance that safe disposal of spent fuel by the Federal 
Government will be available by the year 2025. Therefore, the spent fuel will 
not remain at a reactor site for the length of time it must be isolated from 
humans and the environment. 
It should be noted that the absence of significant environmental impacts 
from dry cask storage at a reactor site is the conclusion of NRC's 
environmental assessment for the Standardized NUHOMS and for previously 
approved dry casks analyzed in earlier rulemakings addressing 10 CFR Part 72, 
as well as in the Commission's Waste Confidence decisions in 1984 (August 31, 
1984; 49 FR 34658) and 1989 (September 29, 1989; 54 FR 39765). In the 1984 
Waste Confidence decision, the Commission concluded there was reasonable 
assurance that spent fuel can be safely stored at reactor sites, without 
significant environmental impacts, for at least 30 years beyond expiration of 
NRC reactor operating licenses. The 1989 Waste Confidence decision review 
reaffirmed earlier Commission conclusions on the absence of significant 
environmental impacts. 
G.5. 

Comment. 

One commenter questioned whether the NUHOMS canister 
will fit the conceptual design for the DOE multi-purpose canister (MPC). If 
DOE chooses to use vertical casks (like the VSC) at the MRS, will the NUHOMS 
inner canister fit into the vertical outer concrete shell in the MPC design? 
If local reactors choose the VSC-24 or the NUHOMS, will either inner metal 
canister fit into the overpacks for DOE, or will they have to be opened after 
storage, returned to the pool, the fuel put in a new canister, and the old one 
discarded as radioactive waste? 


Response. 

The Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized 
NUHOMS is intended for the interim storage of spent fuels and is not required 
to conform to, and has not been evaluated by NRC for conformance with, the 
conceptual design for the DOE MPC. DOE has not yet made final decisions 
regarding design or deployment of the MPC. Therefore, it is not possible to 
speculate on conformance of the Standardized NUHOMS to the MPC. 
G.6. 

Comment. 

One commenter asked what are the criteria for 20-year 
renewal of this cask design? How will this be checked? If the design is not 
renewed, what is the plan? 


Response. 

The 1989 proposed rule (May 5, 1989; 54 FR 19379) to 
add Subparts K and L to Part 72 indicated that the 20-year period represents 
what the Commission believes to be an appropriate increment for cask design 
approvals. The application for design reapproval would have to demonstrate 
the cask's ability to perform the necessary safety functions for the 
reapproval period. The application would be evaluated by NRC against the 
Commission's regulatory requirements. If a cask design is not reapproved, the 
licensee would have to remove casks from service as the 20-year approved 
storage life expired. This could mean removal of the spent fuel and storing 
it elsewhere. 
G.7. 

Comment. 

One commenter wanted to discuss the need for an 
additional cask design, including how it would better meet the need of the 
interim dry cask storage of high-level waste. 


Response. 

Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 
(NWPA) provides the following directive: ``The Secretary [of DOE] shall 
establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private sector, for 
the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear reactor power sites, 
with the objective of establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear 
Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian 
nuclear power reactors without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need 
for additional site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' After subsequent 
DOE technical evaluations and based on a full review of all available data, 
the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a final rule 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181). The final 
rule established a new Subpart K within 10 CFR Part 72, entitled ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' Therefore, there 
is a need for casks to be approved by NRC to implement the NWPA to meet the 
demand of the interim dry cask storage of spent fuels in the nuclear power 
plants. However, the variety of cask designs submitted by vendors for NRC 
review and approval is mostly dictated by economic reasons that do not involve 
NRC.

H. A number of commenters wanted site-specific analyses done for each 
use of the Standardized NUHOMS despite the fact that each licensee must 
determine that the site parameters are enveloped by the cask design specified 
in the SAR, SER, and Certificate of Compliance. The intent of Subpart K of

Comment. 

A number of commenters wanted site-specific 
Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). Several commenters stated that an EIS 
should be required on any waste facility that may be permanent along the Great 
Lakes fresh water system. To say that this will have no adverse effect on 
public health and safety is a prediction most of the public does not accept. 
The commenter believes that the generic ruling to use a dry cask storage 
design at any reactor site is impossible and should be discarded. By relying 
on environmental evaluations done in the 1970s before Davis-Besse 
construction, the NRC was remiss in its responsibility to protect the people 
of Ohio from harm by its licensee. Another commenter wants the NRC to 
prepare, at a minimum, an Environmental Assessment (EA) for each site, 
including information on sensitive ecosystems, wildlife, demography, 
meteorology, and geology. The EA should discuss the cask's capability to 
withstand weather conditions and potential catastrophic events. 


Response. 

The potential environmental impacts of utilities using 
the Standardized NUHOMS (or any of the other spent fuel casks approved by NRC 
(10 CFR 72.214)) have been fully considered and are documented in a published 
Environmental Assessment (EA) covering this rulemaking. Further, as described 
below, the EA indicates that use of the casks would not have significant 
environmental impacts. Specifically, the EA notes the 30-plus years of 
experience with dry storage of spent fuel have shown that the previous 
extensive NRC analyses and findings that the environmental impacts of dry 
storage are small and succinctly describes the impacts, including the non-radiological impacts of cask fabrication
(the impacts associated with the 
relatively small amounts of steel, concrete, and plastic used in the casks are 
expected to be insignificant), the radiological impacts of cask operations 
(the incremental offsite doses are expected to be a small fraction of and well 
within the 25 mrem/yr limits in NRC regulations), the potential impacts of a 
possible dry cask accident (the impacts are expected to be no greater than the 
impacts of an accident involving the spent fuel storage basin), and the 
potential impacts from possible sabotage (the offsite dose is calculated to be 
about one rem). All of the NRC analyses collectively yield the singular 
conclusion that the environmental impacts and risks are expected to be 
extremely small. 
NRC EA's for previously approved dry casks also concluded there was an 
absence of significant environmental impacts from dry cask storage at a 
reactor site when they were analyzed in earlier rulemakings addressing 10 CFR 
Part 72 as well as in the Commission's Waste Confidence decisions in 1984 
(August 31, 1984; 49 FR 34658) and 1989 (September 29, 1989; 54 FR 39765). In 
the 1984 Waste Confidence decision, the Commission concluded there was 
reasonable assurance spent fuel can be safely stored at reactor sites, without 
significant environmental impacts for at least 30 years beyond expiration of 
NRC reactor operating licenses. The 1989 Waste Confidence decision review 
reaffirmed earlier Commission conclusions on the absence of significant 
environmental impacts. 
Given the Commission's specific consideration of environmental impacts 
of dry storage and the absence of any new information casting doubt on the 
conclusion that these impacts are expected to be extremely small and not 
environmentally significant, the NRC is not convinced that meaningful new 
environmental insights would be gained from either a new site-specific EIS or 
EA for each site using dry storage methods. 
The EA covering the proposed rule, as well as the finding of no 
significant impact (FONSI) prepared and published for this rulemaking, fully 
comply with the NRC environmental regulations in 10 CFR Part 51. The 
Commission's environmental regulations in Part 51 implement the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and give proper consideration to the 
guidelines of the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ). The EA and FONSI 
prepared as required by 10 CFR Part 51 conform to NEPA procedural 
requirements. Further analyses are not legally required.

The regulation 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K, already authorizes dry cask 
storage and approves dry casks for use by utilities to store spent fuel at 
reactor sites. See 10 CFR 72.214 for a listing of information on Cask 
Certificate Nos. 1000 through 1003, 1005, and 1007. The purpose of this final 
rule is to add one more cask to the list of casks already approved by NRC. 
The cask added to the list in  72.214 by this final rule complies with all 
applicable NRC safety requirements. 
Finally, this final rulemaking applies to the use of this cask by any 
power reactor within the United States. 
H.2. 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that the January 30, 1994, reply 
from NRC's Robert Bernero to Mr. Adamkus, EPA, is completely inadequate, as is 
the March 1994 ``Draft Environment Assessment and Finding of No Significant 
Impact'' because no consideration is given to the site's unsuitability even for LLRW per NRC's own admission, and
``new information which could alter the 
original site evaluation findings'' is ignored. 


Response. 

This final rule does not provide any site-specific NRC 
approval or address site-specific parameters that are peculiar to a particular 
reactor site. The rule only adds one cask design, the Standardized NUHOMS, to 
the list of approved casks available for use by a power plant licensee in 
accordance with the conditions of the general license in Part 72. Pursuant to 
those conditions, each licensee must determine whether or not the reactor site 
parameters (including earthquake intensity and tornado missiles) are 
encompassed by the cask design bases considered in the cask SAR and SER. The 
EA and FONSI for this rule are limited in scope to the Standardized NUHOMS in 
a generic setting. 
Unlike interim storage prescribed in 10 CFR Part 72, the in-ground 
disposal of radioactive material, whether high-level or low-level waste (HLW 
or LLW), must take into account the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical 
characteristics of the site or region to isolate the radioactive waste from 
the accessible environment. Site criteria for in-ground disposal of 
radioactive wastes enable an applicant to choose an appropriate site, one with 
a combination of favorable conditions that will be a natural barrier to retard 
or attenuate the migration of any leaked radioactive material over a long 
period to control releases within acceptable limits. The disposal period for 
LLW is on the order of 500 years, and for HLW it is greater than 10,000 years. 
Therefore, site characteristics are investigated and assessed for interim 
spent fuel storage under Part 72, not to determine their suitability as a 
barrier to release of radioactive material, but rather to determine the 
frequency and the severity of external natural and artificial events that 
could affect the safety of an ISFSI. Unlikely, but credible, severe events 
are considered to determine the safety of the storage cask design. 
H.3. 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that the NRC has not approved 
technologies for the use of spent fuel at the sites of * * * without the need for 
additional site reviews. If that were so, no additional site review would 
have been necessary at Palisades, nor would an SAR revision or a Certificate 
of Compliance amendment be called for right after the VSC-24 was certified. 


Response.

 The approval and use of dry storage technologies under 
the provisions of the general license are relatively new. Questions were 
raised by members of the public about the possible effects of earthquakes and 
erosion at the Palisades site on the safe storage of spent fuel in the VSC-24 
dry casks. As the agency which is responsible for questions about compliance 
with regulatory requirements, which oversees such matters as the ``cop on the 
beat,'' the NRC began an independent assessment to more closely examine the 
behavior of the pad at Palisades under normal conditions, under the long-term 
effects of erosion, and under conditions of a postulated earthquake that might 
cause the sand below or around the pad to move. The results of NRC's 
assessment were documented in the NRC Final Safety Assessment of Independent 
Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) Support Pad (TAC No. M88875). As is 
the case at all sites, NRC requires the cask user to determine if the design 
basis for the storage technology being considered encompasses the site 
parameters at the location where the fuel is to be stored. The review at 
Palisades confirmed this to be the case. As experience with use of this new 
design is gained, modifications to the design described in the SAR are 
expected and allowed under the provisions of 10 CFR 72.48. 
H.4. 

Comment.

 One commenter wanted the environmental impacts of 
alternatives, such as: renewable energy sources, conservation of energy, 
shutting down the nuclear power plants, and wind and solar power evaluated. 


Response.

 Energy production is not the subject of this rulemaking 
and alternative sources of energy are, therefore, not reasonable alternatives 
requiring evaluation. This rulemaking is limited to the addition of the 
Standardized NUHOMS to the list of approved casks in 10 CFR 72.214. 
H.5. 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that the NRC is ignoring the 
regulatory requirements of a site-specific license as to the feasibility of 
using the cask or of modifying its design.

Response.

 This rulemaking does not cover site-specific NRC 
licensees; however, the NRC is not ignoring them. Under NRC regulations, the 
utility has two options in using dry cask storage of spent fuel: (1) The 
licensee may apply for a site-specific license from NRC; or (2) the licensee 
may use an NRC-approved cask under the general license provisions of Subpart K 
of 10 CFR Part 72. However, not all licensees may be able to use the general 
license provisions, either because the fuel type they possess is not storable 
in any cask listed in 10 CFR 72.214 or because none of the cask designs 
envelope the reactor site parameters. The NRC is also not ignoring site-
specific license considerations relating to modifying cask designs. Quite the 
contrary, the criteria that apply to modifications of an NRC-approved cask 
such as the Standardized NUHOMS are the same as the criteria that apply to 
modifications of site-specific ISFSIs. 
H.6. 

Comment.

 Because the populations of several states and provinces, including two-thirds of the population of Quebec, are based
along the St. Lawrence Seaway, one commenter wanted an Economic Impact Statement 
conducted with a cost/benefit analysis citing possible adverse impact on 
tourism and sport fishing. 


Response.

 A regulatory analysis, which considers both benefits 
and impacts of adding the Standardized NUHOMS to the list of NRC-approved 
casks under Subpart K of 10 CFR Part 72, was prepared in support of this 
rulemaking action. It was included as a part of the notice of proposed 
rulemaking and is also included in this final rulemaking notice. However, 
this regulatory analysis reflects the limited scope of this rulemaking. 
Because the rulemaking does not provide any site-specific NRC approvals, NRC 
did not evaluate site-specific economic impacts. 
H.7. 

Comment.

 One commenter wanted to restrict the use of the cask to reactor sites that have responded on schedule to NRC Generic
Letter 88-20, 
Supplement 4, ``Individual Plant Examination of External Events (IPEEE).'' 


Response.

 IPEEE response submittals will not address dry cask 
storage and are not necessary for Standardized NUHOMS use. 
H.8 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that NUHOMS must not receive 
generic approval because site-specific characteristics must be considered. 
The commenter stated that placing this cask on the shores of Lake Erie is 
potential ecocide and the cask is not terrorist-proof. Another commenter 
stated that the potential engineering problems of storing high-level nuclear 
waste in a variety of climatic and geologic regions of the United States are 
not considered. 


Response.

 A utility's use of the Standardized NUHOMS, for the 
storage of spent fuel in casks at a reactor site, would not have a significant 
impact on the environment. This finding is supported by the NRC safety and 
environmental evaluations for the Standardized NUHOMS, including the 
applicant's demonstration of compliance of the cask with NRC requirements, as 
well as by the 1990 rulemaking on dry cask storage and the 1984 and 1989 waste 
confidence proceedings. Because the Standardized NUHOMS can only be used by a 
licensee if the site parameters are enveloped by the cask design basis, as 
specified in the SAR and SER, cask storage of spent fuel near the shore of 
Lake Erie within the specified parameters would not have a significant impact 
on the environment. 
I. The following comments relate to the transportability of dry storage 
casks to an off-site location. 
I.1. 

Comment.

 One commenter questioned how the cask transport methods used at both on-site and off-site locations are related.



Response.

 In this rulemaking, the NRC reviewed the cask vendor's 
proposed means for transporting the Standardized NUHOMS canister and transfer 
cask outside the reactor buildings to the on-site storage pad under the 
storage requirements of 10 CFR Part 72. This on-site movement occurs within 
an owner-controlled area where access can be limited and where operations 
would be safely managed by the general licensee. The NRC did not review the 
Standardized NUHOMS for transport off-site, for example to a DOE MRS or 
repository. Generally, off-site transport of spent fuel occurs in public 
places where the shipper has fewer access restrictions and limited control of 
the surroundings. Off-site spent nuclear fuel shipments must be made in a 
transportation cask approved by the NRC pursuant to NRC's regulations found in 
10 CFR Part 71, ``Packaging and Transportation of Radioactive Material,'' and 
must also comply with pertinent Department of Transportation (DOT) 
regulations. At this time, the NRC is approving the Standardized NUHOMS for 
storage only. 
I.2. 

Comment.

 One commenter, citing a Wisconsin Public Service 
Commission EIS for Point Beach, questioned the statement, ``The baskets' 
heavier weight and larger diameter make the transportability of an intact 
NUHOMS canister to an MRS site or repository questionable.'' 


Response.

 The NRC has not reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS in 
this rulemaking for off-site transportation.

I.3. 

Comment.

 One commenter wanted to know the relationship between 
the Standardized NUHOMS and the NUHOMS MP187 now applying for a Certificate of 
Compliance. Is the MP187 transportable? Will the canister of all models fit 
into the transport overpack? Wouldn't a utility be better off waiting for the 
transportable cask rather than choosing a storage only cask that may have 
compatibility problems with an MPC system? 


Response.

 The MP-187 transportation overpack uses a canister 
similar to the Standardized NUHOMS. However, it is the subject of a separate 
NRC review as part of a site-specific licensing application. Both the 
Standardized NUHOMS and the MP-187 share many common design features. 
However, they are separate applications, and the NRC has not been asked by the 
cask vendor to review whether the Standardized NUHOMS can be transported in 
the NUHOMS MP187 transportation overpack. 
The issue of whether a utility should consider the transportability of 
dry storage casks is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 
I.4. 

Comment.

 One commenter cited a report given at the HLW Conference at Las Vegas, in 1990, ``Integrated Spent Fuel Storage and
Transportation 
Systems using NUHOMS,'' by PNFSI (page 671): ``While subsequent transfer of an 
intact DSC from a NUHOMS on-site transfer cask directly to an OCRWM rail/barge 
is feasible, this method of transfer is not preferred since the assemblies 
would be oriented top down and the DSC bottom shield plug and grapple ring 
assembly would be orientated top up, thus complicating the canister opening 
and fuel handling process at the MRS or geologic repository following 
shipment.'' Has NRC evaluated this situation? Has it been rectified? 


Response.

 Because the cask vendor applied for certification of 
the Standardized NUHOMS only as a storage cask under 10 CFR Part 72, 
transportation of this cask is not a subject of this rulemaking. Therefore, 
the NRC review of the standardized NUHOMS did not consider the particular 
transportation problem described in the comment. 
J. Several commenters supported the rule stating that it is beneficial 
to the NRC and licensees, and it is consistent with NRC's direction to avoid 
unnecessary site-specific licensing reviews. Others disagreed and asked 
specific questions about NRC's approval and oversight process. 
J.1. 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that the NRC statement, ``The 
proposed rule will not have adverse effect on public health and safety,'' 
cannot be guaranteed and, therefore, even though it may be convenient for the 
nuclear industry and the NRC to avoid site-specific approvals, in this case 
these are essential for maintaining public safety. Another commenter 
following the same theme questioned how the following determination was made: 
``this cask, when used in accordance with the conditions specified in the 
Certificate of Compliance and NRC regulations, will meet the requirements of 
10 CFR Part 72; thus, adequate protection of the public health and safety 
would be ensured.'' 


Response.

 Dry storage casks approved by the NRC for use under the 
general license are of a robust design that relies on generic cask features to 
ensure protection of the public health and safety. Additional NRC 
site-specific approvals are unnecessary. NRC oversight and inspections are 
sufficient to ensure that general licensees implement NRC conditions on cask 
use. If specific concerns are raised, the NRC also has the authority to look 
into them and respond as necessary to protect public health and safety. The 
NRC has established specific requirements in 10 CFR Part 72 that must be met 
in order to obtain a Certificate of Compliance for a cask. The details of the 
review and the bases for the NRC concluding that the cask meets the 
requirements of 10 CFR Part 72 are provided in the SER. The goal of dry cask 
storage technology is to store spent fuel safely. That goal, and the 
effectiveness of the technology, have been demonstrated empirically and 
experimentally. Different cask designs may require different types of 
analysis to demonstrate their safety. Therefore, different review methods may 
be appropriate to reach that conclusion. In each case, the level of review 
performed is that needed to provide assurance of adequate protection of the 
public health and safety. 
J.2. 

Comment.

 Several commenters expressed concern over the exemption 
to 10 CFR 72.234(c) granted to VECTRA to begin transfer cask fabrication (but 
not use) ``to have the necessary equipment available for use by Davis-Besse 
Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) in mid-1995, and thus enable DBNPS to maintain 
complete full-core off-load capability in its spent fuel pool following the 
refueling outage scheduled for early 1996.'' One commenter said that seeking 
public comment and providing comments is an exercise in futility because cask 
approval seems to be a fait accompli. Another commenter wants no exemptions 
for fabrication before certification to be allowed, stating that problems have 
developed when all these exemptions are allowed.

Response.

 The NRC granted VECTRA's request for an exemption to 
fabricate the transfer cask before issuance of the Certificate of Compliance 
under its NRC-approved quality assurance program. NRC's exemption decision 
made a special effort to clarify that fabrication was entirely at VECTRA's 
financial risk and did not ensure favorable consideration of VECTRA's 
application. The NRC's finding, based on the SAR for the Standardized NUHOMS 
and the NRC's SER, concluded that beginning fabrication before the issuance of 
the Certificate of Compliance would pose no undue risk to public health and 
safety. Use of the transfer cask is dependent on satisfactory completion of 
NRC's certification process. 
The NRC staff carefully considers the public comments received in 
rulemakings to determine whether changes are needed to the proposed rule. As 
noted elsewhere in this notice, several public comments received in this and 
other cask-approval rulemakings have resulted in changes to the SER and the 
Certificate of Compliance. For this reason, the public comments provide 
useful inputs to the NRC's safety approval process. 
J.3. 

Comment.

 One commenter wanted a Regulatory Guide outlining the 
requirements of an SAR for cask certification (CSAR). Requirements for a CSAR 
have not been clarified. Specific criteria for a TR (TSAR) by a vendor for a 
generic Certificate of Compliance need to be set. 


Response.

 Regulatory Guide 3.61, ``Standard Format and Content for 
a Topical Safety Analysis Report for a Spent Fuel Dry Storage Cask,'' dated 
February 1989, provides guidance for the preparation of a TSAR. Regulatory 
Guide 3.62, ``Standard Format and Content for the Safety Analysis Report for 
Onsite Storage of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' dated February 1989, provides 
guidance in preparing an SAR locating an ISFSI at a reactor site. Both 
Regulatory Guides identify similar information that can be potentially useful 
to prospective applicants for cask certification. 
J.4. 

Comment.

 One commenter wanted to know why Pacific Nuclear 
divested itself of any ownership or relationship to the VSC design in January 
1992. How does this affect proprietary material shared in these two closely 
related designs? How does it affect their relationship to the DOE MPC system? 


Response.

 The key individual involved in the design and 
development of the VSC-24, who was also involved in the design and development 
of the NUHOMS design, left Pacific Nuclear and formed a new company, Pacific 
Sierra Nuclear, for the commercial manufacture and marketing of the VSC-24 
storage system. The NRC has experienced no difficulty obtaining the required 
safety information, including proprietary information or answers to its 
questions from either firm, either before or after divestiture. The NRC is 
not aware of any relationship between the vendors. In addition, the NRC fully 
reviewed the health and safety aspects of each vendor's cask design 
independently. The NRC did not rely on any assumed relationship between the 
two vendors. Concerning their relationship to the DOE MPC system, each vendor 
has to establish its own relationship with DOE. 
J.5. 

Comment.

 One commenter wanted to know how long any model of 
NUHOMS has been used and if fuel has been taken out and evaluated. Has the 
24P or 52B ever been used anywhere and for how long? If not, this is a test 
of a new cask at a reactor site. 


Response.

 The NUHOMS-24P is being used at Duke Power Company, 
Oconee Nuclear Station, under a site-specific license issued January 29, 1990, 
and at Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Station, 
under a site-specific license issued November 25, 1992. Monitoring and 
surveillance of the system is being performed under the conditions of the 
site-specific license. However, there has been no need for fuel to be removed 
for evaluation.

The NUHOMS-52B has not been used yet. Pre-operational testing of the 
first cask system put in place under the general license is to be performed in 
accordance with Certificate of Compliance, Attachment A, ``Conditions for 
Systems Use.'' Monitoring and surveillance of the system will be performed 
under the conditions of the Certificate of Compliance. 

The first use of the Standardized NUHOMS-52B will not place plant 
workers, the public, or the environment at risk. Conditions of use for the 
Standardized NUHOMS-52B ensure adequate safety of the workers, the public, and 
the environment. The Standardized NUHOMS-52B has been designed and will be 
fabricated to well established criteria of the ASME B&PV and ACI codes. It 
uses construction materials that have well known and documented properties to 
provide the necessary structural strength and radiation shielding to meet 
regulatory requirements. While the Standardized NUHOMS-52B is not identical 
to the NUHOMS-24P, many parallels in design and function can be drawn to 
demonstrate that the Standardized NUHOMS-52B will perform as intended. 

J.6. 

Comment. 

One commenter stated that even though dry cask storage 
passes all NRC rules and is one of the least expensive methods, it would seem 
that a different location or more expensive storage method is worth lives, 
resources, and property. 



Response. 

Based on numerous NRC reviews and growing experience 
with dry cask storage technologies, the NRC has concluded that spent fuel can 
be safely stored in dry casks without significant risk to the public health 
and safety. More expensive storage techniques or alternative storage 
locations would not provide any significant additional public protection. 
Further, the storage location is a matter of Congressional policy as reflected 
in Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, which includes the 
following directive: ``The Secretary [of DOE] shall establish a demonstration 
program in cooperation with the private sector, for the dry storage of spent 
nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear power reactor sites, with the objective of 
establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission 
may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional site-
specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section III(a) also finds that the 
generators of the spent fuel have the primary responsibility to provide for 
the interim storage of the spent fuel until it is accepted by the DOE. 

The type of spent fuel stored in the dry cask storage systems is one 
factor that allows the cost of the systems to be lower. Because the fuel has 
cooled a number of years, passive cooling can be used rather than active 
cooling as is required for fuel just removed from the reactor. Passive 
cooling reduces the cost by not having active components such as pumps, heat 
exchanger, water filters, and the maintenance required for these components. 

J.7. 

Comment. 

One commenter opposed licensing any dry cask storage 
system other than the DOE multi-purpose canister (MPC) because it minimizes 
handling individual fuel assemblies, standardizes compatibility between 
storage sites and DOE, and reduces cost. Multiple cask designs lead to less 
expertise in production, operation, and accident management. Federal 
regulations need to be amended to mandate only the use of the MPC. 



Response. 

The DOE MPC system will not be available for general 
use until well after 1997. In the meantime, additional storage capacity is 
needed now at several reactor sites. Once the MPC is available for general 
use, most utilities might use it. However, given the demonstrated and 
immediate need of some reactors for an additional storage capacity, and given 
NRC's responsibility to implement dry cask storage under a general license 
pursuant to NWPA of 1982, it would not be prudent for NRC now to require use 
of MPC designs that not even DOE has yet approved. 


The NRC does not agree that the number of cask designs has a significant 
effect on the level of expertise available because standard engineering and 
scientific skills such as mechanical and civil engineers and health safety 
specialists can be hired as needed. 

K. Several commenters had concerns about decommissioning issues. 

K.1. 

Comment. 

One commenter, citing the draft SER, stated that 
decommissioning and decontamination of reactors and reactor sites remain 
uncertain at best. ``At this time, it is not known whether demolition and 
removal of the HSM can be performed by conventional methods * * *. The reinforced 
structure of the HSM, for example, will require considerable effort to 
demolish.'' The commenter continues by indicating that in its typical fashion 
of putting off until tomorrow what it cannot deal with today, the NRC 
considers ``ease of decommissioning (a) secondary consideration.'' 



Response. 

The demolition of the HSM will be more difficult than a 
typical building because of the large amount of reinforced steel it contains. 
However, it is technically feasible and represents a likely level of effort 
similar to that required to demolish a bank vault. Bank vaults are routinely 
demolished without extraordinary effort. The HSM may become slightly 
radioactive from being exposed to a neutron radiation field during the spent 
fuel storage period, which would require some containment during demolition to 
prevent the spread of contamination. Recognizing this, the NRC considers 
decommissioning a secondary consideration compared to the safety afforded by 
storage of spent fuel in dry casks.

K.2. 

Comment. 

One commenter questioned how, where to, and when the 
spent fuel and casks will go? How does the decommissioning of NUHOMS affect 
the reactor decommissioning plan if no repository is sited and the pool must 
remain open? Another commenter expressed concern that after the operating 
facility has been decommissioned, the spent fuel pool may not be available for 
use in recovery of a breached DSC. 



Response. 

The Commission determined in the Waste Confidence 
decisions that sufficient repository capacity will be available, in the first 
quarter of the 21st century, to accept spent fuel that is already in storage 
or that will be generated during the lifetime of the reactor licensed by NRC. 
In addition, the Commission determined that spent fuel can be safely stored at 
reactors until it is disposed. The bases for these determinations are 
extensively discussed in the Waste Confidence decisions 
(54 FR 39765; September 28, 1989 and 49 FR 34658; August 31, 1984) and remain 
applicable today. 

To operate the dry spent fuel storage area under the provisions of the 
general license, a license to possess or operate a nuclear power reactor under 
10 CFR Part 50 is required. If the reactors were decommissioned and the 
license terminated, and if the spent fuel were to remain on site, a specific 
license issued under 10 CFR 72.40 would be required. At the time of 
application for a specific license and before the Part 50 license was 
terminated, the licensee would have to address the subject of how the fuel 
will be repackaged for shipment to an MRS or repository. (None of the casks 
now listed in 10 CFR 72.214 are approved for transportation). Decommissioning 
and termination of a Part 50 license for a given reactor site must take into 
account the proper disposal of any spent fuel. 

L. A number of positive and negative comments were received about the 
application of 10 CFR 72.48 or Item 9 of the Certificate of Compliance to 
general licensees. 


L.1. 

Comment. 

Several commenters questioned the application of 
10 CFR 72.48 to Certificate of Compliance holders for use by a general 
licensee. Some commenters believe that this regulation is being 
inappropriately applied to general licensees and cask vendors. These 
commenters believe that the regulation was intended to apply to site-specific 
licenses issued under 10 CFR 72.40 only. One commenter cited the parallel 
application of 10 CFR 50.59 to 10 CFR Part 50 licensees. Any changes to the 
Certificate of Compliance and the supporting SAR and SER need public input 
using the rulemaking process. Who would make the decisions in using the terms 
``unreviewed safety questions,'' ``significant increase,'' and ``significant 
environmental impact''? Other commenters liked this addition, stating that 
non-safety-significant changes can be made in a timely and cost effective 
manner. Several commenters supported the incorporation of item number 9 
(in 72.48 type language) in the draft Certificate of Compliance. One 
commenter wanted similar provisions made for general license holders with 
recordkeeping requirements applicable to the general license rather than the 
certificate holder. Changes requiring an amendment to the certificate should 
be initiated by the certificate holder only. 



Response. 

The NRC will not allow changes in the Certificate of 
Compliance under 10 CFR 72.48. However, the general licensee may make changes 
in the SAR under 10 CFR 72.48, unless it involves an unreviewed safety 
question, a significant increase in occupational exposure, or a significant 
unreviewed environmental impact. The general licensee must make the 
determinations, in the first instance, that are necessary for application of 
10 CFR 72.48. The licensee must also retain its evaluations on its records 
(which are subject to NRC review). 


Supporting this application of 10 CFR 72.48 to the general license are 
the words of 10 CFR 72.48(a)(1) which provides as follows: ``The holder of a 
license issued under this part may: (i) Make changes in the ISFSI * * * 
described in the Safety Analysis Report, * * * (iii) * * * without prior 
Commission approval, unless the proposed change, test or experiment involves a 
change in the license conditions incorporated in the license, an unreviewed 
safety question, a significant increase in occupational exposure, or a 
significant unreviewed environmental impact.'' Also supporting the 
interpretation is 10 CFR 72.210 which provides as follows: ``A general license 
is hereby issued for the storage of spent fuel in an independent spent fuel 
storage installation at power reactor sites to persons authorized to possess 
or operate nuclear power reactors under Part 50 of this chapter.'' The NRC 
staff is considering a rulemaking to amend NRC regulations to explicitly state 
that 10 CFR 72.48 applies to general licensees. 


L.2. 

Comment. 

One commenter stated that the CFR is silent on how a 
vendor can change a cask SAR and certificate after the final rule. It should 
be made clear for the vendor that this cask SAR (CSAR) is generic for all 
United States sites. All seismic, control component, distance, changes in 
length and weight, changes in transfer devices, etc., need to be clearly 
defined in the proposed rulemaking for the cask and the CSAR before public 
comment. Who would be liable if a utility requested the vendor to change a 
certified cask design?

Response. 

The cask vendor can apply to the NRC for a change to 
the cask certificate and SAR after the final rule is published in the 

Federal Register

. The vendor must propose the generic revisions to the certificate 
and SAR and request NRC review of the proposed revision. The NRC will 
evaluate the proposed revision in an SER, and if appropriate, prepare a draft 
revised Certificate of Compliance. These documents would then be placed in 
the NRC Public Document Room and a proposed rule would be published requesting 
public comments on the proposed revised Certificate of Compliance. After 
consideration of public comments (and assuming an appropriate basis exists), a 
final rule would be published incorporating the revision in the revised 
Certificate of Compliance. 



The SAR (CSAR) is not necessarily generic for all United States 
operating reactor sites as the comment appears to suggest. The SAR is 
pertinent for those sites that have parameters that are incorporated by the 
cask design bases analyzed in the SAR. From a practical standpoint, it is 
difficult for a cask vendor to foresee all possible combinations of seismic, 
control component, distance, changes in length and weight, changes in transfer 
devices, etc. Revisions are expected when the vendor submits its initial 
application for approval. The vendor is responsible for the certified cask 
design. 



L.3. 

Comment. 

One commenter wanted an explanation for not allowing 
buyer substitution of material for a Certificate of Compliance and that these 
references should be deleted from fabrication specifications and drawings. 
Does this mean that no changes in any materials are allowed once the design is 
certified? If so, explain this in reference to new models of the VSC-24 as 
far as materials, coatings, etc.? 





Response. 

Under 10 CFR Part 72, the licensee is permitted to make 
changes in the ISFSI as described in the SAR provided the changes do not 
involve an unreviewed safety question. The licensee and cask certificate 
holder must have a quality assurance (QA) program that provides control over 
activities affecting quality of the identified structures, systems, and 
components to an extent commensurate with the importance to safety and to 
ensure conformance with the approved design. The NRC does not want buyers 
(who may not be the licensee or certificate holder) of cask materials to 
automatically be able to substitute material without the necessary safety 
evaluations. Rather, the licensee, through the cask certificate holder, has 
the ultimate responsibility for approving any changes to ensure conformance 
with the approved design. For structures, systems, and components identified 
as important to safety, if alternative materials are desired to be used and 
those specific materials form the basis of the safety evaluation, it would be 
appropriate to identify those materials in the cask application. 
Alternatively, the certificate holder may seek an amendment to the SAR and, if 
necessary, a change to the Certificate of Compliance. For other structures, 
systems, or components that are needed for the design to be used or are 
otherwise prudent, but do not perform a safety function and were not relied 
upon in the basis for design approval, appropriate changes may be permitted 
provided the licensee and the Certificate of Compliance holder document the 
appropriate evaluations and use their quality assurance programs to implement 
the change. New models of the VSC-24 casks are not the subject of this 
rulemaking. 



L.4. 

Comment. 

One commenter questioned how the draft Environmental 
Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact would remain valid if changes 
to cask design and procedures can be made. Tests or experiments could be 
conducted under draft Certificate of Compliance Item No. 9 (see also 
10 CFR 72.48) leading to the use of a cask that does not meet the conditions 
specified in the Certificate of Compliance. These changes may adversely 
impact site-specific public health, safety, and the environment. 





Response. 

Given the limiting criteria of 10 CFR 72.48, it is 
unlikely that any change would materially change the environmental analysis. 
The licensee's authority under 10 CFR 72.48 does not permit any changes that 
involve unresolved safety issues, changes to the conditions for cask use in 
the Certificate of Compliance, significant increase in occupational exposure, 
or significant environmental impact. In the Environmental Assessment 
supporting this rulemaking to approve the Standardized NUHOMS, the NRC staff 
evaluated various types of accidents that could happen to the ISFSI facility. 
The NRC staff's evaluation encompassed design basis accidents and concluded 
that no radioactive material will be released to the environment. The NRC 
staff also evaluated a worst-case accident and found that the environmental 
impact is insignificant. Therefore, it is unlikely that the potential impact 
from changes to cask design or tests or experiments under the control of the 
licensee would introduce new environmental considerations or impacts that 
differ from or exceed those as analyzed in the Environmental Assessment. 
Changes in environmental impacts, as a result of changes to the cask design or 
procedures, must be evaluated by the licensee. The licensee's evaluations are 
available for inspection by the NRC.

M. A number of technical clarifications and editorial issues were 
raised. 



M.1. 

Comment. 

One commenter stated that both the SAR and SER on which 
the Certificate of Compliance is based should be dated, as was the case for 
the VSC-24 Certificate of Compliance. If not, the public will be commenting 
on an unfinished document that can be endlessly revised. 





Response. 

Both the draft SER and the SAR are dated November 1993. 
These documents were revised based on public comments. 



M.2. 

Comment. 

One commenter wanted page one of the Certificate of 
Compliance revised to change the name ``Pacific Nuclear'' to ``VECTRA''. 





Response. 

The Certificate of Compliance has been revised to 
reflect this. 



M.3. 

Comment. 

One commenter pointed out a typographical error on page 
A-19 of the draft Certificate of Compliance. In the Basis paragraph, the 
sentence starting, ``Acceptable damage may occur * * *'' should read ``Unacceptable damage may occur
* * *'' 





Response. 

The Certificate of Compliance has been revised to 
correct this. 



M.4. 

Comment. 

One commenter requested clarification of Technical 
Specification 1.2.16 on page A-25 of the draft Certificate of Compliance, as 
to whether the Yearly Average Ambient Temperature is a surveillance 
requirement or an action statement. It is unclear what action should be taken 
if either of the two specified limits (Yearly average temperature <70 
 F or 
average daily ambient temperature <100 
 F) is exceeded. 





Response. 

The Yearly Average Ambient Temperature specification is 
a site-specific parameter that the user must verify in accordance with the 
requirement of 10 CFR 72.212(b)(3) in order to use the system under the 
general license. There is no surveillance requirement or further action to be 
taken. 



Certificate of Compliance Section 1.1.1, ``Regulatory Requirements for 
General License,'' also includes verification of some of the same site-specific 
temperature parameters and has been amended to include the 100
 F or less 
average daily ambient temperature parameter. Therefore, this specification 
mentioned in the comment (draft Certificate of Compliance Section 1.2.16) was 
deleted. 



M.5. 

Comment. 

Apparently in reference to a December 4, 1991, letter 
from PNFSI that stated ``The NUHOMS Certification Safety Analysis Report (CSAR) 
was * * *,'' one commenter believed that the use of the term CSAR was a good idea 
and should have been used by the NRC. The utility SAR should be called SAR as 
it was and the vendor SAR should be called CSAR just as NUHOMS did in 1990. 
Also, the acronyms topical report (TR), TSAR, and SAR are being used 
interchangeably and they need clear definition. This would eliminate 
confusion on the issue by those involved. 
 




Response. 

The NRC staff generally agrees with the comment. 
However, the required documents that form the basis of the NRC staff's safety 
review are clearly identified in the SER and Certificate of Compliance. 



M.6. 

Comment. 

One commenter wanted the term ``certificate holder'' 
eliminated because it is ambiguous and misleading. 





Response. 

The term ``certificate holder'' has been changed to 
``holder of a Certificate of Compliance'' to be consistent with the regulations. 



M.7. 

Comment. 

One commenter wanted the draft Certificate of Compliance 
clarified as to who is responsible for the use of seismic restraints at each 
reactor site, the vendor or the utility, citing the ambiguous term 
``certificate holder.'' 





Response. 

The utility is responsible for determining the need for 
seismic restraints in the spent fuel building based on seismic conditions at 
the site (Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.2.17). 



M.8. 

Comment. 

Several commenters stated that the limits on both 
neutron and gamma emission rates as well as neutron and gamma spectra 
(Attachment A, Section 1.2.1 of draft Certificate of Compliance) result in 
excluding some fuel assemblies that would actually produce lower dose rates. 
The problem for fuel qualification stems from the fact that the neutron dose 
rate does not decrease as rapidly as the gamma dose rate during cooling 
because of the longer lived isotopes. Thus, a high burned fuel assembly 
excluded on the basis of high neutron source term may remain excluded, even 
though with extra cooling time the combined neutron/gamma dose rate could be 
less than the design basis case. Some fuel may not qualify because it exceeds 
the spectra requirements, even though the energy groups exceeding the limits 
may not be significant contributors to the dose rates. Combined neutron/gamma 
dose rates are the real concern; it is recommended that the limits on source 
term be replaced by limits based on dose equivalence. The fuel specification 
should allow other combinations of fuel enrichment, burnup, and cooling time 
that would not result in exceeding the fuel cladding temperature or dose 
rates. 





Response. 

The NRC staff agrees that alternative fuel 
specifications could be beneficial. However, this commenter did not provide a 
specific alternative, and the NRC staff has not evaluated any other 
alternative at this time because VECTRA did not include this approach in the 
SAR. Therefore, no other approach is considered for this rulemaking.

M.9. 

Comment.

 One commenter suggested wording changes to the draft 
Certificate of Compliance in Attachment A, Section 1.2.6, Action b, as 
follows: ``Visually inspect placement of top shield plug. Re-install or 
adjust position of top shield plug if it is not properly seated.'' The 
commenter also proposed wording changes to Action c of the same section as 
follows: ``Install additional temporary shielding or implement other ALARA 
actions, as appropriate.'' 


Response.

 The NRC staff agrees with the first comment and has 
added the suggested words to the Certificate of Compliance, Section A.1.2.6, 
Action b. It is not necessary to change Action c because 10 CFR Part 20 ALARA 
already applies to these activities. 
M.10. 

Comment.

 One commenter wanted draft Certificate of Compliance, 
Attachment A, Section 1.2.6, Action d deleted. The user should be permitted 
to analyze and document higher dose rates under 10 CFR 72.48, which is 
available for NRC review. Another commenter wanted the complete Section 1.2.6 
of Attachment A to the draft Certificate of Compliance deleted. Given that 
HSM dose rates are specified, a specification for DSC dose rates is not 
necessary because only the workers involved in the canister closure operations 
are affected by them and they are already covered by the reactor radiation 
protection program. One commenter wanted draft Certificate of Compliance, 
Attachment A, Section 1.2.11 deleted. Given that HSM dose rates are 
specified, a specification for transfer cask dose rates is not necessary 
because only the workers involved are affected, not the general public. The 
commenter also stated that if Section 1.2.11 cannot be deleted the action 
statement should be revised to read as follows: ``If specified dose rates are 
exceeded, place temporary shielding around the affected areas of the transfer 
cask or implement other ALARA actions, as appropriate. Review the plant 
records of the fuel assemblies which have been placed in the DSC to ensure 
they conform to the fuel specifications of Section 1.2.1. The report to the 
NRC should be deleted with the user being able to analyze and document the 
higher dose rates under 10 CFR 72.48, which is available for NRC review.'' 


Response.

 The dose rate limits are for design purposes. The dose 
rate is limited to ensure that the DSC has not inadvertently been loaded with 
fuel not meeting the vendor/applicant spent fuel specifications. The NRC will 
require reporting if the specified dose limits are exceeded. For these 
reasons, the NRC will not grant the above requests. 
M.11. 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that the requirement for a 
dissolved boron concentration in the DSC of 2000 ppm is in excess of the 1810 
ppm site-specific license. The 1810 ppm dissolved boron is sufficient to 
ensure reactivity below 0.95 K-eff (95/95 tolerance level with uncertainties) 
assuming 24 fresh fuel assemblies. For the unlikely worst case with water 
density of 0.2 to 0.7 gm/cc (a condition not achievable for fresh fuel), 
reactivity remains below 0.98 K-eff. The pool dissolved-boron verification- 
measurement frequency should be changed from not to exceed 48 hours to once 
per month to be consistent with 10 CFR Part 50 requirements. 
Another commenter stated that the NUHOMS-24P canister was designed using 
burnup credit, the basis for licensing is ``credit for soluble boron.'' The 
burnup-enrichment curve requirement (Figure 1-1, draft Certificate of 
Compliance) should be removed until the NRC accepts burnup credit and the pool 
boron specification (Section 1.2.15, draft Certificate of Compliance) is 
removed. 
The NRC has not yet approved the use of burnup credit in criticality 
analyses for spent fuel storage and transportation casks. The applicant did, 
however, analyze credit for burnup as an alternative design acceptance basis 
for the NUHOMS-24P DSC, pending further consideration of burnup credit by NRC. 
As discussed in the SER, the NUHOMS-24P DSC criticality safety is approved 
based on, among others, the key assumptions of loading with irradiated fuel 
assemblies with equivalent enrichment <1.45 wt% U-235, misloading unirradiated 
fuel with maximum enrichment of 4.0 wt% U-235, and soluble boron in water for 
wet loading and unloading. The NRC considered the use of the burnup- 
enrichment curve, Certificate of Compliance, Figure 1-1, as a fuel selection 
criteria, to be prudent. Its use adds additional unanalyzed conservatism in 
the criticality safety margin. It is comparable to previous NUHOMS-24P 
approvals. Its use would also be consistent with the requirement that storage 
cask designs be, to the extent practicable, compatible with removal of the 
stored spent fuel from the reactor site, transportation, and ultimate 
disposition by DOE. Therefore, the NRC disagreed with the commenter's request 
to allow Standardized NUHOMS-24P users the option of using these burnup- 
enrichment curve. 


Response.

 The comment appears to refer to the use of a NUHOMS 
24P associated with a site-specific license. The ``standardized NUHOMS 24P and 
52B'' are the subject of this general rulemaking and should not be confused 
with a site license. The SER for this rulemaking is clear about conditions 
for use, i.e., 2000 ppm boron concentration is required to ensure that the 
k

eff

 remains below 0.95. The SAR for this rulemaking does not request, nor does the SER grant, exemption from the requirement
of k

eff

 = 0.95 for all accident conditions, including misloading of 24 unirradiated fuel assemblies and optimum moderation
density.

The NRC has not yet approved the use of burnup credit in criticality

M.12. 

Comment.

 Several commenters stated that the listing of specific fuel types in the draft Certificate of Compliance is overly
restrictive. Allowance should be made for very similar fuel types or a ``fuel qualification table'' as proposed by
the vendor should replace the listing. 


Response.

 The NRC agrees that allowance should be made for very 
similar types of fuel to be stored. The Certificate of Compliance provides 
this flexibility. The ``fuel qualification table'' consideration at this time 
is not subject to this rulemaking. 
M.13. 

Comment.

 One commenter citing the first paragraph of page A-27 of the draft Certificate of Compliance states that the
postulated adiabatic 
heatup would result in concrete temperatures being exceeded in approximately 
40 hours. As a result, it is appropriate and conservative to perform the 
visual surveillance to verify no vent blockage on a daily basis to ensure that 
a blockage existed for less than 40 hours. The last sentence in the first 
paragraph should reflect that the module needs to be removed from service if 
it cannot be established that the blockage is less than 40 hours, not 
24 hours. A 24-hour surveillance interval will adequately verify this. One 
commenter cited an inconsistency in Section 3 of the draft Certificate of 
Compliance. Section 3.1 indicates that a module must be removed from service 
if a vent blockage is in existence for longer than 24 hours. Surveillance 
Section 1.3.2 indicates that a module must be removed from service if the 
concrete accident temperature criterion has been exceeded for more than 
24 hours. A vent blockage of less than 24 hours would not cause the 
temperature limit to be exceeded, as explained in Section 1.3 and the 
objective for the 24-hour frequency required by surveillance 1.3.1. The 
apparent conflict between Section 1.3 and the action for Surveillance 
Requirement 1.3.2 should be resolved. It appears that Surveillance 
Requirement 1.3.2 actions are appropriate. 


Response.

 The Certificate of Compliance has been clarified to 
reflect the comment. 
M.14. 

Comment.

 One commenter stated that Section 1.2.14 to 
Attachment A of the draft Certificate of Compliance is unnecessary because the 
time to transfer the DSC from the transfer cask to the HSM would normally 
require less than 8 hours. During this time, even with temperatures above 
100
 F without the solar shield, any increase in fuel clad temperature and 
neutron shield temperature would be small and therefore not detrimental. 
Additionally, the transfer cask is open to the atmosphere and would not 
pressurize. 


Response.

 The vendor, VECTRA, has proposed this limiting 
condition of operation in lieu of showing what detrimental effect might occur 
on the cladding or neutron shield, should the ambient conditions involve 
temperatures above 100
 F. The NRC concurs with this condition as cited in 
Attachment A, Section 1.2.14 of the Certificate of Compliance. 
N. Several commenters raised safeguards/sabotage issues. 
N.1. 

Comment.

 One commenter cited the World Trade Center bombing and 
the ease with which a disturbed individual recently breached security and 
remained undetected at a U.S. reactor. Explosive technology has become very 
sophisticated in the last 15 years since the NRC and Sandia Laboratories 
studied the effect of sabotage on shipping casks in the March 1979, 
NUREG-0459, ``Generic Adversary Characteristics Summary Report.'' Another 
commenter made reference to an experiment with balloons which failed. Yet 
another commenter questioned the degree of protection in the spent fuel pool 
versus dry cask storage. Will the cask be in a vital area? Will safeguards 
be reviewed as part of the security plan? What is the effect on the security 
of these casks?

Response. 

The NRC reviewed potential issues related to possible 
radiological sabotage of storage casks at reactor site ISFSIs in the 1990 
rulemaking that added Subparts K and L to 10 CFR Part 72 (55 FR 29181; 
July 18, 1990). NRC regulations in 10 CFR Part 72 establish physical 
protection and security requirements for an ISFSI located within the owner 
controlled area of a licensed power reactor site. Spent fuel in the ISFSI is 
required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(5) to be protected against the design basis 
threat for radiological sabotage using provisions and requirements as 
specified in 72.212(b)(5). Each utility licensed to have an ISFSI at its 
reactor site is required to develop security plans and install a security 
system that provides high assurance against unauthorized activities that could 
constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety. The security 
systems at an ISFSI and its associated reactor are similar in design features 
to ensure the detection and assessment of unauthorized activities. Alarm 
annunciations at the ISFSI are monitored by the security alarm stations at the 
reactor site. Response to intrusion is required. Each ISFSI is periodically 
inspected by NRC and annually audited by the licensee to ensure that the 
security systems are operating within their design limits. The validity of 
the threat is continually reviewed, with a formal evaluation every six months 
by the NRC. 

The NRC is currently conducting a study into the consequences of a 
vehicle bomb detonated in the vicinity of an ISFSI. Following completion of 
this study the NRC will make a determination as to whether additional physical 
protection is warranted. In the interim, the NRC staff believes that the 
inherent nature of the fuel, along with the degree of protection provided by 
the approved storage means for spent fuel, provides adequate protection 
against a vehicle bomb. 

N.2. 

Comment. 

One commenter wanted the emergency plan updated to 
include initiating events caused by unnatural occurrences, such as sabotage, 
particularly for this fuel storage option. The commenter believes that the 
NRC should determine if upgraded or new security barriers are necessary for 
the David-Besse site. 



Response. 

Under 10 CFR 72.212 requirements, each general licensee 
must protect the spent fuel against the design basis threat of radiological 
sabotage. Also, 10 CFR 72.212 requires each general licensee to review the 
reactor emergency plan to determine whether its effectiveness is decreased, 
and if so, to prepare the necessary changes and obtain the necessary 
approvals. Therefore, the comment is already essentially incorporated into 
NRC regulations. 

O. Several commenters had fabrication, quality assurance, and 
inspection concerns. 


O.1. 

Comment. 

One commenter raised questions about NRC oversight and 
requirements for proper cask fabrication by licensees. This is based on tests 
of the faulty welds at the Palisades plant conducted in July 1994 just before 
the cask was filled, but the test was not reviewed. 



Response. 

The ultimate responsibility to ensure proper cask 
fabrication belongs to the user of the cask. Each Part 50 licensee (general 
licensee) must have its own quality assurance (QA) program in place to oversee 
vendor activities. The QA requirements apply to design, purchase, 
fabrication, handling, inspection, testing, operation, maintenance, repair, 
modifications of structures, systems and components, and decommissioning that 
are important to safety. In addition, certified cask vendors have NRC-approved QA programs that control the implementation
of these quality 
activities in a manner appropriate to the safety significance of these 
activities. In turn, the general licensee reviews, approves, and oversees its 
vendor's QA programs and activities. The NRC inspects both the general 
licensee and the subtiered vendors for compliance with the respective QA 
program requirements and for the adequacy of the activities performed. 

The faulty welds at Palisades in a loaded cask happened because the 
radiographs were not read initially. If the radiographs were read in a timely 
manner, the cask should not have been loaded without corrective action first 
being taken. NRC oversight and involvement in the process contributed to 
timely detection of the defective cask weld. 


O.2. 

Comment. 

One commenter wants clarification of the quality 
assurance program. NRC should have a regulatory guide for vendors with strong 
criteria for audits and subcontractors, and NRC inspection reports of 
fabricating facilities need to be put in the PDR. How will a subcontractor of 
NUHOMS vendor be checked by NRC in the future? If a vendor is going to 
continuously change subcontractors, the NRC should inspect each cask and 
carefully inspect the vendor QA manual.

Response. 

Chapters 11 or 13 of Regulatory Guides 3.62 and 3.61, 
respectively, provide guidance on acceptable quality assurance programs. 
These chapters state that a QA program meeting the requirements of Appendix B 
of 10 CFR Part 50 or Subpart G of 10 CFR Part 72 will be accepted by NRC. 
Both Parts 50 and 72 require an audit program. An NRC Branch Technical 
Position titled ``Quality Assurance Programs for an Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation (ISFSI) 10 CFR 72,'' implements the NRC review of quality 
assurance programs submitted by applicants. NRC inspection reports are 
routinely placed in the PDR except for reports containing sensitive 
information. Inspection reports of NUHOMS fabrication are available in the 
PDR. 

O.3. 

Comment. 

One commenter wanted to know if any nonconformances have 
been discovered in inspection reports of any fabrication of the NUHOMS 
canister. If so, what? How was this resolved? How has the QA program for 
NUHOMS been reviewed? Is there a manual? How will contractors and 
subcontractors be checked? 


Response. 

A notice of nonconformance is documented in NRC 
Inspection Report No. 721004/93-07 dated August 23, 1993. The NRC staff 
conducted inspections in three phases at Duke Power Company, its contractor 
(Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.) and subcontractor (Rancor, Inc.), 
concerning the QA activities with regard to the NUHOMS-24P dry spent fuel 
storage canisters. The NRC staff found that implementation of Duke Power 
Company QA Program was satisfactory, in general. However, certain NRC 
requirements under Subpart G of 10 CFR Part 72 were not met. QA activities 
cited in the inspection report were documentation of nonconforming materials, 
parts, or components; quality assurance records; control of purchased 
material, equipment, and services; control of measuring and test equipment; 
instructions, procedures, and drawings; licensee inspection; and audits. 
Nonconformance corrective actions were taken and documented by Duke Power 
Company. The NRC staff found these corrective actions acceptable and so 
stated in letters dated January 13, 1994, and April 4, 1994. The corrective 
actions taken and the implementation of the QA Program are reviewed in 
periodic inspections by the NRC staff. 

The latest version of the QA manual is ``VECTRA Technologies, Inc., 
Quality Assurance Manual,'' Revision 1, transmitted July 25, 1994, which 
reflects the corporation's new name and organization and includes additional 
changes to update the manual and clarify QA recordkeeping commitments. The 
NRC staff found Revision 1 acceptable and so stated in its letter dated 
August 23, 1994. In its review, the NRC staff compared Revision 1 of the 
VECTRA QA Manual with Revision 3, Edition 2, of the PNSI QA manual, which the 
NRC staff found acceptable by letter dated January 28, 1993. 

Contractors and subcontractors of cask vendors (or licensees) are 
subject to periodic QA inspections performed by the NRC staff. 


O.4. 

Comment. 

One commenter wanted to know if there is a possible 
problem, and if there was, how it was resolved, with a material defect in 
Swagelok tube fittings for NUHOMS? 



Response. 

The NRC is not aware of any material defect problem 
with Swagelok tube fittings on NUHOMS designs. There is no reliance on the 
Swagelok fittings as part of the confinement boundary for the NUHOMS canister. 
The fittings are covered by a metal plate that is welded on after the canister 
is vacuum dried. Therefore, if there is a failure in the fitting it would be 
the responsibility of the licensee to repair or replace it so that the DSC can 
be loaded properly, but its failure would not cause a public health and safety 
concern.

Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 



The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 
10 CFR Part 51, that this rule is not a major Federal action significantly 
affecting the quality of the human environment and therefore an environmental 
impact statement is not required. This final rule adds an additional cask to 
the list of approved spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees can 
use to store spent fuel at reactor sites without additional site-specific 
approvals from the Commission. The environmental assessment and finding of no 
significant impact on which this determination is based are available for 
inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), 
Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and finding of 
no significant impact are available from Mr. Gordon E. Gundersen, Office of 
Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington 
DC, 20555, telephone (301) 415-6195. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection 
requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et 
seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget approval number 3150-0132. 



Regulatory Analysis 



The Commission has prepared a regulatory analysis on this regulation. 
The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by 
the Commission. Interested persons may examine a copy of the regulatory 
analysis at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), 
Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained from 
Mr. Gordon E. Gundersen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington DC, 20555, telephone (301) 415-6195. 



Regulatory Flexibility Certification 



As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), 
the Commission certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only 
licensees owning and operating nuclear power reactors and cask vendors. The 
owners of nuclear power plants do not fall within the scope of the definition 
of ``small entities'' set forth in Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, or the Small Business Size Standards set out in 
regulations issued by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR Part 121. 



Backfit Analysis 



The NRC has determined that the backfit rules 10 CFR 50.109 and 
10 CFR 72.62 do not apply to this final rule. A backfit analysis is not 
required for this final rule because this amendment does not involve any 
provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1) or 
72.62(a).

Capital; Capital Adequacy Guidelines

AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board or Federal Reserve) is revising its capital adequacy guidelines
for state member banks and bank holding companies to establish a limitation on the amount of certain deferred tax assets
that may be included in (that is, not deducted from) Tier 1 capital for risk-based and leverage capital purposes. The
capital rule was developed in response to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) issuance of Statement
No. 109, ``Accounting for Income Taxes'' (FAS 109). Under the final rule, deferred tax assets that can only be realized
if an institution earns taxable income in the future are limited for regulatory capital purposes to the amount that
the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end report date_based on its projection of taxable
income_or 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, whichever is less.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:





I. Background



A. Characteristics of Deferred Tax Assets



Deferred tax assets are assets that reflect, for financial reporting purposes, benefits of certain aspects of tax
laws and rules. Deferred tax assets may arise because of specific limitations under tax laws of different tax jurisdictions
that require that certain net operating losses (e.g., when, for tax purposes, expenses exceed revenues) or tax credits
be carried forward if they cannot be used to recover taxes previously paid. These ``carryforwards'' are realized
only if the institution generates sufficient future taxable income during the carryforward period.

Deferred tax assets may also arise from the tax effects of certain events that have been recognized in one period for
financial statement purposes but will result in deductible amounts in a future period for tax purposes, i.e., the
tax effects of ``deductible temporary differences.'' For example, many depository institutions and bank holding
companies may report higher income to taxing authorities than they reflect in their regulatory reports

1

 because their loan loss provisions are expensed for reporting purposes but are not deducted for tax purposes until
the loans are charged off.





Deferred tax assets arising from an organization's deductible temporary differences may or may not exceed the amount
of taxes previously paid that the organization could recover if the organization's temporary differences fully
reversed at the report date. Some of these deferred tax assets may theoretically be ``carried back'' and recovered
from taxes previously paid. On the other hand, when deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences
exceed such previously paid tax amounts, they will be realized only if there is sufficient future taxable income during
the carryforward period. Such deferred tax assets, and deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards, are hereafter referred to as ``deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable
income.''



B. Summary of FAS 109



In February 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 109, ``

Accounting for Income Taxes

'' which supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11 and FASB Statement No. 96. FAS 109 provides guidance
on many aspects of accounting for income taxes, including the accounting for deferred tax assets. FAS 109 potentially
allows some state member banks and bank holding companies to record significantly higher deferred tax assets than
previously permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the federal banking agencies'
prior reporting policies.

2

 Unlike the general practice under previous standards, FAS 109 permits the reporting of deferred tax assets that are
dependent upon future taxable income. However, FAS 109 requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reduce
the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not (i.e., a greater than 50 percent likelihood) to be
realized.





FAS 109 became effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 1992. The adoption of this standard has
resulted in the reporting of additional deferred tax assets in Call Reports and FR Y-9C reports that directly
increase institutions' undivided profits (retained earnings) and Tier 1 capital.



C. Concerns Regarding Deferred Tax Assets That Are Dependent Upon Future Taxable Income



The Federal Reserve has certain concerns about including in capital deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future
taxable income. Realization of such assets depends on whether a banking organization has sufficient future taxable
income during the carryforward period. Since a banking organization that is in a net operating loss carryforward
position is often experiencing financial difficulties, its prospects for generating sufficient taxable income
in the future are uncertain. In addition, the condition of and future prospects for an organization often can and do
change very rapidly in the banking environment. This raises concerns about the realizability of deferred tax assets
that are dependent upon future taxable income, even when an organization may be sound and well-managed. Thus, for
many organizations such deferred tax assets may not be realized, and for other organizations there is a high degree
of subjectivity in determining the realizability of this asset. Furthermore, while many organizations may be able
to make reasonable projections of taxable income for relatively short periods and actually realize this income,
beyond a short time period, the reliability of the projections tends to decrease significantly. In addition, unlike
many other assets, banking organizations generally cannot obtain the value of deferred tax assets by selling them.

Moreover, as an organization's condition deteriorates, it is less likely that deferred tax assets that are dependent
upon future taxable income will be realized. Therefore, the organization is required under FAS 109 to reduce its deferred
tax assets through increases to the asset's valuation allowance. Additions to this allowance would reduce the organization's
regulatory capital at precisely the time it needs capital support the most. Thus, the inclusion in capital of deferred
tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income raises supervisory concerns.

Because of these concerns, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council
(FFIEC), considered whether it would be appropriate to adopt FAS 109 for regulatory reporting purposes. On August
3, 1992, the FFIEC requested public comment on this matter, and on December 23, 1992, after consideration of the comments
received, the FFIEC decided that banks and savings associations should adopt FAS 109 for reporting purposes in Call
Reports and Thrift Financial Reports (TFRs) beginning in the first quarter of 1993 (or the beginning of their first
fiscal year thereafter, if later). Furthermore, the Board decided that bank holding companies should adopt FAS 109
in FR Y-9C Reports at the same time.



D. Proposal for the Treatment of Deferred Tax Assets



The FFIEC, in reaching its decision on regulatory reporting, also recommended that each of the agencies amend its
regulatory capital standards to limit the amount of deferred tax assets that can be included in regulatory capital.
In response to the FFIEC's recommendation, on February 11, 1993, the Board issued for public comment a proposal to
adopt the recommendation of the FFIEC in full, as summarized below (54 FR 8007, February 11, 1993). The FFIEC recommended
that the agencies limit the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income that can be
included in regulatory capital to the lesser of:

i. the amount of such deferred tax assets that the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end
report date, based on its projection of taxable income (exclusive of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards
and reversals of existing temporary differences), or

ii. 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage
servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted).

Deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences would generally not be limited under the proposal.



II. Public Comments on the Proposal



The comment period for the Board's proposal ended on March 15, 1993. The Board received nineteen comment letters including
ten from multinational and large regional banking organizations, and three community banks. In addition, the Board
received four comment letters from bank trade associations and two from finance companies. Sixteen commenters offered
support for the Board's proposal to require banking organizations to 

report, 

for regulatory purposes, deferred tax assets in accordance with FAS 109. In addition, fifteen commenters indicated
that it would be preferable for the Board to place no limit on the amount of deferred tax assets allowable in capital.
These commenters indicated that, in their view, embracing FAS 109 in its entirety would achieve consistency between
regulatory standards and GAAP as well as maintain consistency with the intent of Section 121 of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991. Commenters asserted that the criteria set forth in FAS 109
to recognize and value deferred tax assets is sufficiently conservative to limit any exposure to the bank insurance
fund and that an arbitrary or mechanical formula, such as the ones proposed, would not provide a more accurate or reliable
result.

While preferring no capital limit on deferred tax assets, some commenters noted that the proposal represented a compromise
and a step forward from prior regulatory policies that permitted little or no inclusion in regulatory reports or capital
of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income. Two commenters generally supported the proposal
or expressed their understanding of the regulator's concern regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets
and one commenter indicated the capital treatment should be consistent with the capital treatment for identifiable
intangible assets.



A. Responses to the Board's Questions



Question 1: (Gross-up of Intangible Assets) Nine commenters responded to the Board's first question regarding whether
certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in a nontaxable business combination accounted for as a purchase
should be adjusted for the tax effect of the difference between the market or appraised value of the asset and its tax
basis. Under FAS 109, this tax effect is recorded separately in a deferred tax liability account, whereas under preexisting
GAAP, this tax effect reduced the amount of the intangible asset. This change in treatment could cause a large increase
(i.e., gross-up) in the reported amount of certain identifiable intangible assets, such as core deposit intangibles,
which are deducted for purposes of computing regulatory capital.

Seven commenters indicated that banking organizations should be permitted to deduct the net after-tax amount of
the intangible asset from capital, not the gross amount of the intangible asset. These commenters argued that FAS
109 will create artificially high values for intangible assets and the related deferred tax liability when a banking
organization acquires the assets with a carryover basis for tax purposes but revalues the asset for financial reporting
purposes. The commenters generally indicated that, under FAS 109, the balance sheet will not accurately reflect
the value paid for the intangibles. Furthermore, commenters indicated that the increased value of the intangible
posed no risk to institutions, because a reduction in the value of the asset would effectively extinguish the related
deferred tax liability.

On the other hand, two commenters indicated that the pretax (gross) value of intangible assets should be deducted
for regulatory capital purposes in this situation. This organization contended that intangible assets should be
treated similarly to other assets, which are not reduced by any related liability.

Question 2: The Board's second question inquired about (i) the potential burden associated with the proposal and
whether a limitation based on projections of taxable income would be difficult to implement, and (ii) the appropriateness
of the separate entity method for deferred tax assets and tax sharing agreements in general.

i. 

Methodology Based on Income Projections. 

The Board received eleven letters from commenters who responded directly to this aspect of the question. Four commenters
supported using income projections and stated that calculating deferred tax asset limitations for capital purposes
based on projected taxable income would not be difficult to implement and would not impose an additional burden because
many banking organizations already forecast taxable income in order to recognize their deferred tax assets. One
commenter added that these calculations should not pose any problems, provided they are done on a consolidated basis.
In addition, one commenter suggested that the Board clarify the term ``realized within one year'' so that readers
understand that the phrase means the amount of deferred tax assets that could be used to offset income taxes generated
in the next 12 months, and not the amount of deferred tax assets that actually will be used.

Four commenters specifically opposed an income approach, citing the additional burden that would be created by the
detailed calculations. One commenter specifically favored implementing the percentage of capital method since
it is certain and exact and does not involve as many estimations or fluctuations as the income approach.

Five commenters supported an approach based on the financial condition of the institution, some of whom also offered
support or opposition to the income or percentage of capital approach. One commenter suggested that ``healthy''
institutions be permitted to include deferred tax assets in regulatory capital in an amount based on a specified percentage
of Tier 1 capital. Another commenter supported an approach that excluded ``well capitalized'' banks from the limitation.
On the other hand, one commenter did not support using an approach for calculating the capital limitation based upon
the perceived ``health'' of the institution, stating that this method could lead to arbitrary and inconsistent measures
of capital adequacy.

ii. 

Separate Entity Approach. 

Twelve commenters specifically addressed this part of the question. Under the Board's proposal, the capital limit
for deferred tax assets would be determined on a separate entity basis for each state member bank so that a bank that
is a subsidiary of a holding company would be treated as a separate taxpayer rather than as part of the consolidated
entity. All of the commenters opposed the separate entity approach. They argued that the separate entity approach
is artificial and that tax-sharing agreements between financially capable bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries
should be considered when evaluating the recognition of deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes. Commenters
also stated that the separate entity method is unnecessarily restrictive and that any systematic and rational method
should be permitted for the calculation of the limitation for each bank.

One commenter based its opposition for the separate entity approach on the view that the limitation is not consistent
with the Board's 1987 ``Policy Statement on the Responsibility of Bank Holding Companies to Act as Sources of Strength
to Their Subsidiary Banks'' which, in some respects, treats a controlled group as one entity. Another commenter contended
that the effect of a separate entity calculation would be to reduce bank capital which is needed for future lending
which would be inconsistent with the March 10, 1993, ``Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability''. The
same commenter also noted that the regulatory burden and cost of calculating the deferred tax asset on a separate entity
basis would be substantial for both bankers and regulators.

Question 3: The Board's third question addressed three specific provisions of the proposal. These provisions included
(i) requiring tax planning strategies to be part of an institution's projection of taxable income for the next year,
(ii) requiring organizations to assume that all temporary differences fully reverse at the report date, and (iii)
permitting the grandfathering of amounts previously reported if they were in excess of the proposed limitation.

i. 

Inclusion of Tax Planning Strategies. 

Two commenters addressed this issue. Both commenters stated that they support including tax planning strategies
in an institution's projection of taxable income. One commenter stated that the proposal should be modified to permit
institutions to consider strategies that would ensure realization of deferred tax assets within the one-year time
frame. The proposal provided that organizations should consider tax planning strategies that would realize tax
carryforwards or net operating losses that would otherwise expire during that time frame.

ii. 

Temporary Differences. 

Four commenters specifically addressed this aspect of the question, and all agreed that it is appropriate to require
the assumption that all temporary differences fully reverse as of the report date. One commenter noted that this assumption
would eliminate the burden of scheduling the ``turnaround'' of temporary differences.

iii. 

Grandfathering. 

Five commenters discussed the proposal's provision on grandfathering which would allow the amount of any deferred
tax assets reported as of September 1992 in excess of the limit to be phased out over a two year period ending in 1994.
Four commenters offered support for grandfathering but argued that excess deferred tax assets should be grandfathered
until the underlying temporary differences reversed, rather than be phased out over two years. The other commenter
disagreed with the grandfathering proposal and stated that such provisions would be inconsistent with the proposal's
capital adequacy objectives.

A. Limitation on Deferred Tax Assets 


Consistent with the FFIEC's recommendation and the Board's proposal, the Board is limiting in regulatory capital
deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income to the lesser of: 
i. The amount of such deferred tax assets that the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end
report date, based on its projection of taxable income (exclusive of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards
and reversals of existing temporary differences), or 
ii. 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage
servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted).

Deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences are generally not limited under the final rule. The reported amount of deferred tax
assets, net of its valuation allowance, in excess of the limitation would be deducted from Tier 1 capital for purposes
of calculating both the risk-based and leverage capital ratios. Banking organizations should not include the amount
of disallowed deferred tax assets in weighted-risk assets in the risk-based capital ratio and should deduct the amount
of disallowed deferred tax assets from average total assets in the leverage capital ratio. Deferred tax assets included
in capital continue to be assigned a risk weight of 100 percent. 
To determine the limit, a banking organization should assume that all existing temporary differences fully reverse
as of the report date. Also, estimates of taxable income for the next year should include the effect of tax planning
strategies the organization is planning to implement to realize net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards
that will otherwise expire during the year. Consistent with FAS 109, the Board believes tax planning strategies are
carried out to prevent the expiration of such carryforwards. Both of these requirements are consistent with the proposal.

The capital limitation is intended to balance the Board's continued concerns about deferred tax assets that are dependent
upon future taxable income against the fact that such assets will, in many cases, be realized. This approach generally
permits full inclusion of deferred tax assets potentially recoverable from carrybacks, since these amounts will
generally be realized. This approach also includes those deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable
income, if they can be recovered from projected taxable income during the next year. The Board is limiting projections
of future taxable income to one year because, in general, the Board believes that organizations are generally capable
of making projections of taxable income for the following twelve month period that have a reasonably good probability
of being achieved. However, the reliability of projections tends to decrease significantly beyond that time period.
Deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are further limited to 10 percent of Tier 1 capital,
since the Board believes such assets should not comprise a large portion of an organization's capital base given the
uncertainty of realization associated with these assets and the difficulty in selling these assets apart from the
organization. Furthermore, a 10% capital limit also reduces the risk that an overly optimistic estimate of future
taxable income will cause the bank to significantly overstate the value of deferred tax assets. 
Banking organizations already follow FAS 109 for regulatory reports and accordingly, are making projections of
taxable income. Banking organizations already report in regulatory reports the amount of deferred tax assets that
would be disallowed under the proposal. In addition, the 10 percent calculation of Tier 1 capital is straightforward.
Therefore, the Board believes that banking organizations will have little difficulty implementing this final rule.



B. Guidance on Specific Implementation Issues 


In response to the comments received and after discussions with the other agencies, the Board is providing the following
guidance. 
Originating Temporary Differences_Consistent with the Board's proposal, the final rule does not specify how the
provision for loan and lease losses and other originating temporary differences should be treated for purposes of
projecting taxable income for the next year. Banking organizations routinely prepare income forecasts for future
periods and, in theory, income forecasts for book income should be adjusted for originating temporary differences
in arriving at a projection of taxable income. On the other hand, requiring such adjustments adds complexity to the
final rule. Furthermore, deductible originating temporary differences, such as the provision for loan and lease
losses, generally would lead to additional deferred tax assets. Thus, arguably, such temporary differences should
not be added back to book income in determining the amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized. Accordingly,
the Board is permitting each institution to decide whether or not to adjust projected book income for originating
temporary differences. While the Board is not specifying a single treatment on originating temporary differences
in the final rule, institutions should follow a reasonable and consistent approach.

Gross-up of Intangibles_As noted above, FAS 109 could lead to a large increase (i.e., gross-up) in the reported amount
of certain intangible assets, such as core deposit intangibles, which are deducted for purposes of computing regulatory
capital. Commenters stated that the increased value of an intangible posed no risk to institutions, because a reduction
in the value of the asset would effectively extinguish the related deferred tax liability. The Board concurs with
this position and, consequently, will permit, for capital adequacy purposes, netting of deferred tax liabilities
arising from this gross-up effect against related intangible assets. To ensure this benefit is not double counted,
a deferred tax liability netted in this manner could not also be netted against deferred tax assets when determining
the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income. Netting will not be permitted against
purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) and purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs), since only the portion
of these assets that exceed specified capital limits are deducted for capital adequacy purposes. 
Leveraged Leases_While not expected to significantly affect many banking organizations, one commenter stated
that future net tax liabilities related to leveraged leases acquired in a purchase business combination are included
in the valuation of the leveraged lease and are not shown on the balance sheet as deferred tax liabilities. This artificially
increases the amount of deferred tax assets for those institutions that acquire a leveraged lease portfolio. Thus,
this commenter continued, the future taxes payable included in the valuation of a leveraged lease portfolio in a purchase
business combination should be treated as a taxable temporary difference whose reversal would support the recognition
of deferred tax assets, if applicable. The Board agrees with this commenter and, therefore, banking organizations
may use the deferred tax liabilities that are embedded in the carrying value of a leveraged lease to reduce the amount
of deferred tax assets subject to the capital limit. 
Tax Jurisdictions_Unlike the proposal, the final rule does not require an institution to determine its limitation
on deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. While such an approach may theoretically be more
accurate, the Board does not believe the greater precision that would be achieved in mandating such an approach outweighs
the complexities involved and its inherent cost to institutions. Thus, banking organizations may make projections
of their taxable income on an organization-wide basis and use a combined tax rate for purposes of calculating the one-year
limitation. 
Timing_Institutions may use the future taxable income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any
significant changes that have occurred or are expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report
date rather than preparing a new projection each quarter. Several commenters requested this treatment because it
reduces the frequency with which banking organizations are required to revise their estimate of future taxable income.

Available for Sale Securities_Under FASB Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities'' (FAS 115), ``available-for-sale'' securities are reported in regulatory reports at market value,
and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are included, net of tax effects, in a separate component of stockholders
equity. These tax effects may increase or decrease the amount of deferred tax assets an institution reports. 
The Board has recently decided to exclude from regulatory capital the amount of net unrealized gains and losses on
available for sale securities (except net unrealized losses of available-for-sale equity securities with readily
determinable fair values) (59 FR 63241, December 8, 1994). Thus, excluding for capital adequacy purposes deferred
tax effects arising from reporting unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is consistent
with the regulatory capital treatment for such gains and losses. On the other hand, requiring the exclusion of such
deferred tax effects would add significant complexity to the capital guidelines and in most cases would not have a
significant impact on regulatory capital ratios. 
Therefore, when determining the capital limit for deferred tax assets, the Board has decided to permit, but not require,
institutions to adjust the reported amount of deferred tax assets for any deferred tax assets and liabilities arising
from marking-to-market available-for-sale debt securities for regulatory reporting purposes. This choice will
reduce implementation burden for institutions not wanting to contend with the complexity arising from such adjustments,
while permitting those institutions that want to achieve greater precision to make such adjustments. Institutions
must follow a consistent approach with respect to such adjustments. 
Separate Entity Method_The proposed capital limit was to be determined on a separate entity basis for each state member
bank. Use of a separate entity approach on income tax sharing agreements (including intercompany tax payments and
current and deferred taxes) is generally required by the Board's 1978 Policy Statement on Intercorporate Income
Tax Accounting Transactions of Bank Holding Companies and State Member Banks, and similar policies are followed
by the other banking agencies. Thus, any change to the separate entity approach for deferred tax assets would also
need to consider changes to this policy statement, which is outside the scope of this rulemaking. The Board notes that
regulatory reports of banks are generally required to be filed using a separate entity approach and consistency between
the reports would be reduced if the Board permitted institutions to use other methods for calculating deferred tax
assets in addition to a separate entity approach. Thus, while a number of the commenters suggested that the Board consider
permitting other approaches, the Board will generally require the separate entity approach.
 




As proposed, the final rule contains an exception to the separate entity approach when a state member bank's parent
holding company does not have the financial capability to reimburse the bank for tax benefits derived from the bank's
carryback of net operating losses or tax credits. In these cases, the amount of carryback potential the bank may consider
in calculating the capital limit on deferred tax assets is limited to the lesser amount which it could reasonably expect
to have refunded by its parent. 
Grandfathering_The proposal would grandfather any deferred tax assets reported as of September 1992 in excess of
the proposed limit, but would require that such excess amounts be phased out over a two year period ending in 1994. Since
all grandfathered amounts are now fully amortized, the Board's final rule does not include any grandfathering provision.



IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 


The Board does not believe that the adoption of this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small business entities (in this case, small banking organizations), in accordance with the spirit and
purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). In this regard, the vast majority of small banking
organizations currently have very limited amounts of net deferred tax assets, which are the subject of this proposal,
as a component of their capital structures. In addition, this final rule, in combination with the adoption by the Board
of FAS 109 for regulatory reporting purposes, allows many organizations to increase the amount of deferred tax assets
they include in regulatory capital. Moreover, because the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines generally
do not apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $150 million, this proposal will not affect
such companies. The Board did not receive any comment letters specifically addressing regulatory flexibility concerns,
and therefore, no alternatives to the proposal were considered to address regulatory flexibility. 


V. Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Burden 


The Board has determined that this final rule will not increase the regulatory paperwork burden of banking organizations
pursuant to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 
Section 302 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-325, 108
Stat. 2160) provides that the federal banking agencies must consider the administrative burdens and benefits of
any new regulation that impose additional requirements on insured depository institutions. Section 302 also requires
such a rule to take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter following final publication of the rule, unless the
agency, for good cause, determines an earlier effective date is appropriate.

Deferred tax assets.

 The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a bank's capital may not exceed the lesser
of: (i) the amount of these deferred tax assets that the bank is expected to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end
date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year,
 or (ii) 10 percent of tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating this limitation, Tier 1 capital is defined as the sum
of core capital elements, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing
rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted). The
amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences and that do not exceed the amount which the bank could reasonably expect
to have refunded by its parent (if applicable) generally are not limited. The reported amount of deferred tax assets,
net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, in excess of these amounts is to be deducted from a bank's core
capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.

a. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to total assets
to assist in the assessment of the capital adequacy of state member banks.
 The principal objective of this measure is to place a constraint on the maximum degree to which a state member bank can
leverage its equity capital base. It is intended to be used as a supplement to the risk-based capital measure. 





b. The guidelines apply to all state member banks on a consolidated basis and are to be used in the examination and supervisory
process as well as in the analysis of applications acted upon by the Federal Reserve. The Board will review the guidelines
from time to time and will consider the need for possible adjustments in light of any significant changes in the economy,
financial markets, and banking practices. 



II. The Tier 1 Leverage Ratio



a. The Board has established a 

minimum 

level of tier 1 capital to total assets of 3 percent. An institution operating at or near these levels is expected to
have well-diversified risk, including no undue interest-rate risk exposure; excellent asset quality; high liquidity;
and good earnings; and in general be considered a strong banking organization, rated composite 1 under CAMEL rating
system of banks. Institutions not meeting these characteristics, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial,
or operational weaknesses, are expected to operate well above minimum capital standards. Institutions experiencing
or anticipating significant growth also are expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions,
well above the minimum levels. For example, most such banks generally have operated at capital levels ranging from
100 to 200 basis points above the stated minimums. Higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular
circumstances or risk profiles of individual banks. Thus for all but the most highly rated banks meeting the conditions
set forth above, the minimum tier 1 leverage ratio is to be 3 percent plus an additional cushion of a least 100 to 200 basis
points. In all cases, banking institutions should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks,
including the volume and severity of problem loans, to which they are exposed. 

b. A bank's tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing its tier 1 capital (the numerator of the ratio) by its average
total consolidated assets (the denominator of the ratio). The ratio will also be calculated using period-end assets
whenever necessary, on a case-by-case basis. For the purpose of this leverage ratio, the definition of tier 1 capital
for year-end 1992 as set forth in the risk-based capital guidelines contained in Appendix A of this part will be used.
 As a general matter, average total consolidated assets are defined as the quarterly average total assets (defined
net of the allowance for loan and lease losses) reported on the bank's Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report),
less goodwill; amounts of purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships that, in
the aggregate, are in excess of 50 percent of tier 1 capital; amounts of purchased credit card relationships in excess
of 25 percent of tier 1 capital; all other intangible assets; any investments in subsidiaries or associated companies
that the Federal Reserve determines should be deducted from tier 1 capital; and deferred tax assets that are dependent
upon future taxable income, net of their valuation allowance, in excess of the limitation set forth in section II.B.4
of this Appendix A.
 






c. Whenever appropriate, including when a bank is undertaking expansion, seeking to engage in new activities or otherwise
facing unusual or abnormal risks, the Board will continue to consider the level of an individual bank's tangible tier
1 leverage ratio (after deducting all intangibles) in making an overall assessment of capital adequacy. This is consistent
with the Federal Reserve's risk-based capital guidelines an long-standing Board policy and practice with regard
to leverage guidelines. Banks experiencing growth, whether internally or by acquisition, are expected to maintain
strong capital position substantially above minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible
assets.

Deferred tax assets.

 The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a banking organization's capital may not
exceed the lesser of: (i) the amount of these deferred tax assets that the banking organization is expected to realize
within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year,
 or (ii) 10 percent of tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating this limitation, tier 1 capital is defined as the sum
of core capital elements, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing
rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted). The
amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences generally are not limited. The reported amount of deferred tax assets,
net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, in excess of these amounts is to be deducted from a banking organization's
core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.

a. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to total assets
to assist in the assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies (banking organizations).
 The principal objectives of this measure is to place a constraint on the maximum degree to which a banking organization
can leverage its equity capital base. It is intended to be used as a supplement to the risk-based capital measure. 




b. The guidelines apply to consolidated basis to banking holding companies with consolidated assets of $150 million
or more. For bank holding companies with less that $150 million in consolidated assets, the guidelines will be applied
on a bank-only basis unless (i) the parent bank holding company is engaged in nonbank activity involving significant
leverage
 or (ii) the parent company has a significant amount of outstanding debt that is held by the general public. 




c. The tier 1 leverage guidelines are to be used in the inspection and supervisory process as well as in the analysis
of applications acted upon by the Federal Reserve. The Board will review the guidelines from time to time and will consider
the need for possible adjustments in light of any significant changes in the economy, financial markets, and banking
practices. 


II. The Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 


a. The Board has established a 

minimum

 level of tier 1 capital to total assets of 3 percent. A banking organization operating at or near these levels is expected
to have well-diversified risk, including no undue interest-rate risk exposure; excellent asset quality; high liquidity;
and good earnings; and in general be considered a strong banking organization, rated composite 1 under BOPEC rating
system of bank holding companies. Organizations not meeting these characteristics, as well as institutions with
supervisory, financial, or operational weaknesses, are expected to operate well above minimum capital standards.
Organizations experiencing or anticipating significant growth also are expected to maintain capital ratios, including
tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels. For example, most such banks generally have operated
at capital levels ranging from 100 to 200 basis points above the stated minimums. Higher capital ratios could be required
if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. Thus for all
but the most highly rated banks meeting the conditions set forth above, the minimum tier 1 leverage ratio is to be 3 percent
plus an additional cushion of a least 100 to 200 basis points. In all cases, banking organizations should hold capital
commensurate with the level and nature of all risks, including the volume and severity of problem loans, to which they
are exposed. 
b. A banking organization's tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing its tier 1 capital (the numerator of the
ratio) by its average total consolidated assets (the denominator of the ratio). The ratio will also be calculated
using period-end assets whenever necessary, on a case-by-case basis. For the purpose of this leverage ratio, the
definition of tier 1 capital for year-end 1992 as set forth in the risk-based capital guidelines contained in Appendix
A of this part will be used.
 As a general matter, average total consolidated assets are defined as the quarterly average total assets (defined
net of the allowance for loan and lease losses) reported on the organization's Consolidated Financial Statements
(FR Y-9C Report), less goodwill; amounts of purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card
relationships that, in the aggregate, are in excess of 50 percent of tier 1 capital; amounts of purchased credit card
relationships in excess of 25 percent of tier 1 capital; all other intangible assets; any investments in subsidiaries
or associated companies that the Federal Reserve determines should be deducted from tier 1 capital; and deferred
tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of their valuation allowance, in excess of the limitation
set forth in section II.B.4 of this Appendix A.
 





c. Whenever appropriate, including when an organization is undertaking expansion, seeking to engage in new activities
or otherwise facing unusual or abnormal risks, the Board will continue to consider the level of an individual organization's
tangible tier 1 leverage ratio (after deducting all intangibles) in making an overall assessment of capital adequacy.
This is consistent with the Federal Reserve's risk-based capital guidelines an long-standing Board policy and practice
with regard to leverage guidelines. Organizations experiencing growth, whether internally or by acquisition,
are expected to maintain strong capital position substantially above minimum supervisory levels, without significant
reliance on intangible assets.

ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Airbus Industrie Model A300, A300-600, A310, and A320 series airplanes, that 
requires inspection of certain landing gear brakes for wear and replacement if the wear 
limits prescribed in this AD are not met, and incorporation of the specified wear limits 
into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This amendment is prompted 
by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO) 
and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of 
allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes. The actions specified by 
this AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A300, A300-600, A310, and A320 series airplanes was
published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7228). That action proposed to require inspection of certain landing gear brakes for wear
and replacement if the wear limits prescribed in this AD are not met, and incorporation of the specified wear limits
into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposed rule. 

One commenter, BFGoodrich, requests that the tables contained in the proposal 
that list maximum brake wear limits for the affected airplanes be revised. BFGoodrich 
indicates that the airplane model/series listed for BFGoodrich series 2-1526 brake part 
numbers should be ``A320,'' instead of ``A320-220'' and ``A320-200.'' The commenter 
also indicates that three additional part numbers for BFGoodrich brakes should be listed 
in the tables for Model A320 series airplanes: Part numbers 2-1526, 2-1526-5 (both with 
maximum wear limits of 1.97
'
'), and 2-1572 (with a maximum wear limit of 2.68
'
'). 

While the FAA agrees with the commenter's remarks, inclusion of the three 
additional part numbers specified by the commenter would necessitate (under the 
provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the 
period for public comment, considering additional comments received, and eventually 
issuing a final rule; the time required for that procedure may be as long as four additional 
months. In the interest of issuing this final rule, and in consideration of the amount of 
time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original notice, the FAA has 
determined that further delay of this final rule action is not appropriate. However, the 
FAA may consider further rulemaking on this issue to address the three additional part 
numbers discussed by the commenter. 

The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its 
members, suggests that measuring the maximum length of the wear pin may not be as 
effective as measuring the total length of the wear pin or controlling the carbon thickness 
of the brake. The commenter points out that, due to human error, it is possible to have a 
thinner disc with the same amount of wear pin length showing. 

The FAA does not concur. The FAA infers from the commenter's remarks that it 
is referring to controlling the carbon thickness of the brakes by direct measurement of the 
thickness of the brake stack. The FAA finds that measuring the thickness of the brake 
stack would only be useful when specifying the brake assembly configuration and the 
thicknesses of new, refurbished, or overhauled individual discs. Otherwise, a brake disc 
that is too thin also could be installed in a brake stack having a wear limit that is 
controlled by measuring the stack thickness. Further, it would not be practical to 
routinely measure the brake stack on the airplane as all of the wheels attached to the 
brakes would have to be removed to allow access to accomplish the measurement. The 
FAA considers that this would pose an unwarranted burden on operators. Currently, only 
the wear pin must be monitored while the brake is installed on the airplane. If an operator 
reduces the wear limit, the pin could be shortened or the operator could devise a method 
of accounting for the reduced wear using the existing wear pin as opposed to removing 
the wheel and measuring the brake stack. (Thus, the wheels would not have to be 
removed from the airplane since the wear pin can still be used to monitor brake wear.) 

The wear limits specified in this AD, which are used to establish wear pin lengths, 
are interdependent with the brake configuration and minimum disc and stack thicknesses. 
The stack and disc thicknesses are specified for new, refurbished, or overhauled brakes in 
the airplane maintenance manual (AMM), the component maintenance manual (CMM), a 
service bulletin, or the brake manufacturer's assembly drawings. These minimum brake 
stack and disc thicknesses have been established by tests and in-service wear data and 
analysis such that monitoring a wear pin should not allow the stack or disc minimum 
limits to be exceeded. 

The ATA also questions the need for the proposed AD, and requests that a 
provision be included in paragraph (a)(2) of the AD to state that the AD would no longer 
be applicable to operators that have acceptably revised their maintenance programs, and 
that operators choosing this provision could use an alternative recordkeeping method in 
lieu of that required by   91.417 or 121.380 of the Federal Aviation Regulations 
(14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal 
Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing this alternative. 

The ATA states that if its suggested provision is not included, confusion will 
always exist as to what records should be maintained for the duration A300/A320 
operations. The ATA maintains that once an operator incorporates the criteria (brake 
wear limits) specified in the proposal into the maintenance program, the AD should be 
signed off as complete, since such incorporation is the stated purpose of the AD. The 
ATA is aware of an FAA concern that the proposed type of rule must continue 
indefinitely because operators may otherwise escalate intervals through their reliability 
programs. The ATA states that adjustments to operators' programs are accomplished 
with substantiation and with the approval of FAA Flight Standards District Offices 
(FSDO). The ATA maintains that FAA FSDO's have sufficient authority to ensure that 
operators maintain the brakes on their Model A300/A320 series airplanes once the 
proposed criteria (brake wear limits) have been incorporated into an operator's 
maintenance program.

The FAA does not concur. The intent of this AD is that operators incorporate maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program, and that all brakes be inspected once for wear and replaced, if necessary. Once an
operator has complied with the requirements of this AD, the FAA does not intend that operators subsequently record
the accomplishment of this AD each time a brake is inspected or overhauled in accordance with that operator's FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program. ``NOTE 2'' has been added to paragraph (a) of the final rule to clarify this intent.
Operators should coordinate recordkeeping for accomplishment of the actions required by this AD with the cognizant
Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI). 

One ATA member requests that carbon brakes be excluded from the applicability of the proposed rule. Airbus adds its
concurrence with the ATA member's request, and has advised the ATA that all carbon brakes installed on airplanes manufactured
by Airbus are capable of sustaining a maximum energy rejected takeoff (RTO) in a 100 percent worn brake configuration.
Airbus also states that no unsafe condition has been identified for airplanes having carbon brakes. 

Airbus also indicates that issuance of an AD to require implementation of existing CMM limits would impose unnecessary
inspections (with associated costs) and would create an unnecessary paperwork burden on operators. Airbus states
that, if the proposed rule is adopted, then an inspection would be required for all airplanes, not just the 28 airplanes
specified in the economic impact information of the proposal. 

The FAA does not concur. As discussed in the preamble of the proposal, this AD, as well as other previously issued AD's
to mandate specific maximum brake wear limits on transport category airplanes, was prompted by an accident in 1988
involving worn brakes on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 series airplane. During the process of promulgating
those AD's, the FAA became aware that not all operators were following the manufacturer's recommended brake wear
limits. The FAA acknowledges that the wear limits for carbon brakes have not changed. However, the purpose of this
AD is simply to establish the correct brake wear limits for the affected airplanes, including those on which carbon
brakes having unchanged brake wear limits, are installed. 

The FAA acknowledges that operators of airplanes having carbon brakes will be required to confirm that inspections
are being accomplished and to record compliance with this AD. However, if an operator already operates in accordance
with the wear limits specified in this AD, as implied by ATA and Airbus, then only the costs associated with confirming
compliance with the AD and recording such compliance are necessary. The economic impact information specified below
addresses 46 airplanes that will be required to accomplish the inspection specified in this AD. (This number, 46,
has been revised from the 28 airplanes specified in the proposal; the FAA's latest information is that 46 airplanes
will be affected by the inspection requirement.) However, carbon brakes may be installed on some of those airplanes;
therefore, some of the 46 airplanes addressed in this AD already may be operated in accordance with its provisions.
Therefore, the actual total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators may be less than the cost reflected in the cost estimate
information, below. 

One commenter requests that the brake wear limit specified in the proposed rule for brake part numbers 2-1526-3
and 2-1526-4 should be revised to read 2.68
'
' (68 mm), rather than 1.97
'
' (50 mm). The commenter indicates that the maximum brake wear limit of 1.97
'
' (50 mm) is already standard for brake part numbers 2-1526-1 and 2-1526-2, whereas
a wear limit of 2.68
'
' (68 mm) is specified in the CMM for brake part numbers 2-1526-3 and 2-1526-4 due to a
different configuration that allows greater wear pin length and still maintains RTO performance at the maximum wear
limit. 

The FAA finds that no change to the final rule is necessary in this regard. The proposed rule, as published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 15, 1994, specified the correct brake wear limit of 2.68
'
' (68 mm) for brake part numbers 2-1526-3 and 2-1526-4. That same brake wear limit is
contained in this final rule. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour.
The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.
In addition to the number of affected airplanes of U.S. registry that will be required to accomplish the inspection
(as discussed previously), the FAA has updated the total number of airplanes of U.S. registry and the number of affected
U.S. operators to reflect the latest information available. 

The FAA estimates that 165 Model A300, A300-600, A310, and A320 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 7 U.S. operators
will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20 work hours per operator, at an average labor rate of $60
per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the revision of its FAA-approved maintenance inspection program.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,400, or $1,200
per operator. 

The FAA also estimates that it will take 15 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour, to accomplish
the required inspection. The cost of required parts to accomplish the change in wear limits for these airplanes (that
is, the cost resulting from the requirement to change the brakes before they are worn to their previously approved
limits for a one-time change) will be approximately $2,236 per airplane. The FAA estimates that 46 of the 165 affected
airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish the inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of that requirement on U.S. operators of these airplanes is estimated to be $144,256, or $3,136 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no affected operator has accomplished all
of the requirements of this AD action, and that no affected operator would accomplish all of those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Issued December 15, 1994.




I. Introduction 





On October 14, 1994, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI)

1

 filed a petition under section 207 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure

2

 requesting issuance of a Policy Statement regarding the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances in coordination
transactions under the Federal Power Act. The acid rain control title (Title IV) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, Pub. L. No. 101-549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990) (CAAA), provides for the issuance of emissions
allowances as a means to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions levels. EEI proposes that emission allowances be included
in rates at the allowance's incremental cost

3

 with customers having the choice of two options to compensate the seller of allowances. Either the customer may return,
or transfer, emissions allowances in kind or it may compensate the seller for its incremental cost of emissions allowances.
EEI proposes that the seller be allowed to use a particular price index selected by the seller or an average of several
price indices to determine the current cost to replace an allowance. EEI requests issuance of the Policy Statement
by January 1, 1995, when Phase I of the CAAA becomes effective. 







The Commission agrees with EEI that issuance of a Policy Statement on the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances
in coordination transactions is necessary at this time. The primary goal of the allowance trading program is to encourage
utilities to implement the lowest overall cost actions to comply with the cap on sulfur dioxide emissions contained
in the CAAA. The development of a national and open allowance trading market, the Commission believes, depends in
part upon regulators sending public utilities a clear signal on how allowance trades and CAAA compliance costs will
be treated for ratemaking purposes. Accordingly, the Commission hereby issues a Policy Statement adopting EEI's
proposal, with various modifications discussed below. The Commission also hereby issues an Interim Rule implementing
the guidelines set forth in this Policy Statement.

II. Public Reporting Burden 


The Policy Statement and Interim Rule would clarify how existing filing requirements apply to utilities filing amendments
to coordination rate schedules to provide for the recovery of emissions allowance costs and to recover them in a timely
fashion. Because this Policy Statement and Interim Rule only clarify how existing requirements are to be implemented,
the public reporting burden for these information collections (including the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information) is not estimated to increase the number of hours per response for each utility currently involved
in the filing of rate schedule amendments. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these
collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services
Division, (202) 208-1415], and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and
Budget, Washington D.C. 20503 (Attention: Desk Officer for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), FAX: (202)
395-5167. 


III. Background 


The CAAA and Allowance Trading 


The acid rain control title of the CAAA sets forth a comprehensive regulatory mechanism designed to control acid rain
by limiting sulfur dioxide emissions by electric utilities. The CAAA require reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions
in two phases. Phase I begins on January 1, 1995, and applies to 110 mostly coal-fired utility plants containing about
260 generating units specifically listed in the statute. These plants are owned by about 40 jurisdictional utility
systems that are expected to reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by as much as 4.5 million tons. Phase II begins
on January 1, 2000, and applies to virtually all existing steam-electric generating utility units with capacity
exceeding 25 megawatts and to new generating utility units (generally those commencing operation after November
15, 1990) of any size. Phase II permanently caps sulfur dioxide emissions at 9 million tons annually. The Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) issues to the owners of generating units allowances (defined as an authorization to emit,
during or after a specified calendar year, one ton of sulfur dioxide)

5

 equal to the number of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions authorized by the CAAA. EPA does not assess a charge for the allowances
it awards. 




The allowances are not unit-specific and can be sold or traded. Utilities have incentives to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions so that they can use allowances to cover load growth, to make additional off-system sales or to sell or trade
allowances on the open market, offsetting the costs of compliance. Utilities that reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide
emitted below their authorized level (

e.g.

, by switching to a lower sulfur coal, switching to a new fuel, installing scrubbers, repowering a unit, or using demand
side management (DSM)) may bank their allowances (

i.e.

, hold and use them in another year) or sell or trade them to other utilities that expect to exceed their authorized emission
level or other allowance market participants such as marketers. 
Congress created the allowance trading system in Title IV of the CAAA to enable sulfur dioxide emissions reductions
to occur at the lowest cost, by creating a national market for emissions allowances. Basically, the emissions allowance
trading system works in the following manner. Title IV of the CAAA established guidelines for the EPA to implement
a system for issuing, recording and tracking allowances.

6

 Allowance usage at each affected unit is recorded by EPA quarterly. There is a national cap on the total number of allowances
issued by EPA each year.

7

 After the end of each year, EPA determines whether companies have the right number of emissions allowances of appropriate
vintage on hand for each ton of sulfur dioxide emitted during the year. The penalty for not having the requisite number
of allowances on hand is $2,000 per ton plus surrender of an emissions allowance equivalent in the following year,
plus other possible punishments depending on the degree of violation.

8

 The CAAA also require EPA to withhold for direct sale and auction 2.8 percent of the annual allowance allocations.

9

 The allowances are not property rights,

10

 and are not unit-specific.

Whatever steps a utility takes to comply with the CAAA will affect the cost of electric service, 

e.g., 

if a utility installs new equipment, its capital costs will change; if a utility purchases low sulfur fuel, its energy
costs will change; and if a utility buys emission allowances, its operating expenses will change. 
In Docket No. RM92-1-000, 

Revisions to Uniform Systems of Accounts to Account for Allowances under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and Regulatory-Created
Assets and Liabilities and to Form Nos. 1, 1-F and 2-A

, Order No. 552, III FERC Statutes and Regulations, Regulations Preambles  30,967, 58 FR 17982 (April 7, 1993),
the Commission amended its Uniform Systems of Accounts for public utilities, licensees and natural gas companies
to establish uniform accounting requirements for allowances for the emission of sulfur dioxide under the CAAA, and
to establish generic accounts to record assets and liabilities created through the ratemaking actions of regulatory
agencies. While acknowledging the need for the eventual development of a ratemaking framework for allowances, the
Commission declined to expand the scope of the accounting rule to address rate 
issues.

12

 




The EEI Petition 


EEI requests that the Commission now provide guidance on the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances in coordination
transactions so that the CAAA emissions allowance program will work as Congress intended. EEI states that such guidance
is urgently needed in view of the imminent onset of Phase I. EEI states that the allowance market is rapidly evolving,

13

 and EEI expects this market to become even more active when utilities operating the Phase I generating units begin
to use emissions allowances. 




EEI requests the Commission to: (1) Provide for costing emissions allowances at their incremental cost in coordination
rates, determined on the basis of a leading index or combination of indices of the current price of emissions allowances,
such index or combination of indices to be selected by the seller of the power; (2) compensate coordination sellers
by permitting power purchasers at their option either: (a) To transfer or return emission allowances in kind

14

 or (b) compensate the seller for its incremental cost of emission allowances, and (c) declare that purchasers who
provide emissions allowances do not need to make filings with the Commission; (3) find that the cost of emissions allowances
may be recovered under provisions in coordination rate schedules as ``out-of-pocket'' costs; (4) give utilities
up to 45 days after the Commission issues a policy statement to file amendments to rate schedules to allow recovery
of emissions allowance costs beginning January 1, 1995, provided that each utility gives its customers notice of
the emission allowance recovery methodology it will be using when energy is scheduled (the Commission would reserve
the ability, as a condition of making the policy effective January 1, 1995, to order refunds); (5) clarify that the
transfer of emission allowances is not subject to a Section 205 filing and determine that sales of emissions allowances
are not jurisdictional under Section 203 or 205 of the FPA;

15

 and (6) declare that the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances endorsed in this Policy Statement does not
preclude other approaches proposed by individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. 





EEI notes that use of incremental costs as a basis for emission allowance costing is consistent with the cost basis
used for other variable expenses (

e.g., 

fuel) related to coordination transactions and dispatch decisions. According to EEI, many utilities operate under
existing rate schedules that include specific provisions allowing the tracking of incremental costs.

16

 EEI requests that utilities with these types of rate schedules not be required to amend their agreements, but only
be required to supplement their rate schedules with specific details regarding the recovery of the incremental cost
of emissions allowances in their rates.

17

 





Since there may be different ways of determining the incremental cost of emissions allowances, EEI proposes that
utilities be required to submit the following company-specific details. First, EEI suggests that utilities should
be required to choose a leading national index or combination of indices to determine the incremental cost of emission
allowances at the time of the allowance's consumption and be required to use that index until they identify some other
acceptable index in a filing with the Commission. Second, EEI suggests that each utility be required to explain the
method of calculating its emission allowance dispatch value. EEI indicates that the use of incremental costing for
emissions allowances should be consistent with the use of incremental costing for economic dispatch decisions.
EEI proposes that any differences between the incremental costing for coordination sales of emissions allowances
and dispatch decisions regarding emissions allowances be explained and reconciled. Third, EEI suggests that utilities
be required to explain how they will quantify the amount of emission allowances attributable to each transaction.
Fourth, EEI suggests that, with respect to longer-term transactions, utilities be required to specify the timing
of opportunities for buyers to stipulate whether they will purchase or provide the emissions allowances.

18

 Fifth, EEI suggests that utilities be required to identify any other factors that could impact pricing, such as rates
tied to units other than the incremental unit used for the sale.

Interventions and Comments



Notice of the EEI filing was published in the 

Federal Register

,

19

 with comments due on or before November 14, 1994. Tellus Institute for Resource and Environmental Strategies (Tellus),
Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Wisconsin Electric), the Office of the Consumers' Counsel, State of Ohio (Consumers'
Counsel), Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO), Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company (CG&E) and PSI Energy,
Inc. (PSI), Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy Services), EPA, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA),
the City of Cleveland, Ohio (Cleveland), Florida Power & Light Company (Florida Power), and the American Public
Power Association (APPA)

20

 filed timely motions to intervene and/or comments. Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington
Commission), the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California (California Commission) and the Indiana
Utility Regulatory Commission (Indiana Commission) filed notices of intervention and/or timely comments. On November
21, 23, 25 and 30, 1994, Clean Air Capital Markets (Clean Air), Emissions Exchange Corporation (Emissions Exchange),
Cantor Fitzgerald Brokerage, L.P. (Cantor Fitzgerald), and Southern Company Services, Inc. (Southern) filed untimely
motions to intervene and comments. On November 28, 1994, EEI filed reply comments. EEI does not oppose any of the motions
to intervene and welcomes comments on the issues raised in this proceeding. 






Under Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.214, the timely, unopposed motions
to intervene of Tellus, Wisconsin Electric, the Consumers' Counsel, PEPCO, CG&E, PSI, Entergy Services, IPAA,
Cleveland, Florida Power, EPA and APPA and the notices of intervention of the Washington Commission, the California
Commission and the Indiana Commission serve to make them parties to this proceeding. Furthermore, we find that good
cause exists to grant the untimely interventions of Clean Air, Emissions Exchange, Cantor Fitzgerald and Southern,
given the interests they represent, the early stage of this proceeding, and the apparent absence of undue prejudice
or delay. 

Finally, we will accept EEI's reply comments. While responses to protests or answers normally are not permitted under
the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.213(a)(2), responses to intervention requests are

permitted.

21

 Moreover, these reply comments are necessary in order to clarify issues in this proceeding,

22

 provide a more complete record on which the Commission can base its decision,

23

 and assist in the understanding of the parties' positions with respect to certain factual and legal matters.









IV. Rate Issues



Positions of Intervenors and Commenters


CG&E, PSI, Entergy Services, IPAA and Cleveland take no position on the merits of EEI's proposal. The Washington
Commission, the Indiana Commission, PEPCO, and Southern generally express support for the proposal. The remainder
of the intervenors and commenters indicate concerns with various aspects of the proposal, as discussed below. 

The California Commission supports EEI's request that alternative proposals for emissions allowance ratemaking
treatment not be precluded and that such proposals be considered on a case-by-case basis.

EPA supports EEI's request for incremental pricing for allowances and use of an index to establish the incremental
price. However, EPA requests the Commission to address ratemaking for all wholesale transactions at this time. EPA
also seeks a uniform approach for costing and rate treatment of allowances. Thus, EPA requests that the Commission
adopt one index option for use by all public utilities. EPA suggests that its auction presently provides the most reliable
price index. EPA also raises concerns about EEI's proposal to allow alternate ratemaking proposals on a case-by-case
basis. EPA states that utilities should bear the burden of showing that any different approach is justified and will
not result in an unfair competitive advantage in electric power markets. 

Emissions Exchange, Clean Air and Cantor Fitzgerald state that EPA auction prices have consistently been artificially
low and that the EPA auction price is not representative of the open market because the auction is held just once a year
and does not track the current price and availability of allowances. Emissions Exchange asks that the Commission
refrain from dictating use of any particular price index. Instead, Emissions Exchange proposes that this Commission
permit each utility to choose its market price index from a list which includes, but is not limited to, the allowance
price indicators published by Cantor Fitzgerald.

In addition to the problems it sees with the EPA auction, Clean Air maintains that commercial bulletin board services
are also unreliable sources for allowance price information. It argues that bulletin board bid/ask prices may not
reflect actual allowance transactions and could subject market participants to inaccurate price signals, gaming
and manipulation. Clean Air opposes allowing the selling utility to cost emissions allowances at a market index of
its own choosing because this presents the danger of the selling utility picking a price based on the highest-cost
index, with no demonstration that this price reflects the realities of the market. Clean Air also opposes the selection
of a single index by the Commission, stating that the Commission would risk sending misleading price signals. Clean
Air suggests that, in addition to requiring sellers of allowances to inform buyers of the price of allowances and the
number of allowances to be provided, the seller should notify the buyer that there is a third party who will provide
the allowances at a stated price. Clean Air also proposes that the Commission require sellers to report the volume
of allowances transferred, their price and the name of any third parties supplying the allowances. Clean Air states
that this Commission should publish these reports to provide buyers with greater market information. 
The Consumers' Counsel and Tellus state that this Commission should expand the scope of this proceeding to include
the ratemaking treatment of allowances for all wholesale transactions. The Consumers' Counsel also states that
it would be more efficient for a policy statement to recognize other valuation methods in addition to incremental
costs, such as a cost-of-compliance approach, and to specify when that method would be more appropriate.

26

 Additionally, the Consumers' Counsel suggests that the Commission should establish a single monthly market price
for allowances and should develop a standard method of allocation of EPA-granted allowances between wholesale and
retail customers and between affiliates. 





Wisconsin Electric argues that EEI's pricing policy is contrary to the CAAA because it will cause generation to shift
from Phase I units to non-Phase I units. This is because a requirement that utilities charge the full incremental cost
of allowances will result in an increase in the operating cost of Phase I units and result in those units being underutilized.
It is possible, Wisconsin Electric argues, that if a Phase I unit is not utilized at ``baseline'' (1985-1987)
levels, the utility may be required by the CAAA to forfeit allowances.

27

 For these reasons, Wisconsin Electric suggests, the Commission, in its Policy Statement, should allow utilities
with Phase I units the flexibility to charge ``up to'' the incremental cost of a Phase I allowance. Wisconsin Electric
argues that achieving least cost dispatch, in light of complexities such as reduced utilization of Phase I units,
may require use of a dispatch emissions value that differs from incremental cost. 





Florida Power seeks to ensure that the Policy Statement not predetermine the issues raised in 

Southern Company Services, Inc., 

Docket No. ER95-59-000, now pending before this Commission. Florida Power also seeks clarification
that only Phase I utilities need to file the details of their emission allowance recovery method within 45 days, because
it would be premature for Phase II utilities to make such filings now. 

APPA argues that the proposed policy statement would grant excessive discretion to utilities and would open the door
to inconsistent ratemaking treatment. APPA complains that EEI's proposal contains no clear requirement that the
selling utility be consistent in its ratemaking treatment on simultaneous transactions and does not require a utility
to adhere to any particular methodology once adopted. Further, APPA argues, EEI's petition does not define how the
revenues from emissions allowances included in rates will be credited to various customer classes. Moreover, APPA
argues, EEI's proposal that this Commission allow utilities with existing incremental cost rate provisions to file
emission allowance pricing information without revising their rate schedules will authorize utilities to redefine
contract terms unilaterally. APPA contends that EEI's proposal does not clearly define the scope of transactions
to which the Policy Statement will apply. APPA maintains that the Commission should afford affected parties the opportunity
to challenge application of whatever policy is adopted in this Policy Statement on a case-by-case basis. APPA also
believes that this Commission should establish a standard market price for allowances or provide a forum for review
to ensure the justness and reasonableness of indices or methodologies to be used by a selling utility. 

Tellus also states that since several utilities recently have filed differing proposals for emissions allowance
cost recovery in affiliated transactions, this Commission must act promptly to establish generic ratemaking policies
for each type of wholesale arrangement. Tellus further urges the Commission, either in this or in a separate proceeding,
to address the ratemaking treatment of costs of compliance with the CAAA, in addition to allowance costs. Tellus suggests
that this Commission establish its own monthly market index price for emissions allowances, determine how the profits
should be credited to and among wholesale and retail customers, develop a standard method for allocating allowances
obtained from EPA at no cost between wholesale and retail customers, and establish generic policies regarding the
adequacy and appropriateness of current wholesale rate designs for passing CAAA costs through to wholesale customers.
Tellus suggests that average inventory costs might be a valid basis for determining the cost of emissions allowances.

EEI, in reply, again urges issuance of a policy statement by January 1, 1995. EEI argues that the policy guidance requested
is appropriately limited to coordination transactions. EEI argues that coordination transactions are a distinct
category of voluntary transactions and that the treatment it proposes is consistent with Commission precedent for
other out-of-pocket costs incurred in such transactions. EEI submits that the guidance it requests here, while appropriate
for coordination transactions, cannot accommodate the varying circumstances and cost allocation issues involved
in wholesale requirements service or transactions among affiliated companies. EEI also notes, in reply, that the
Commission, in Regulation of Electricity Sales for Resale and Transmission Service, Notice of Inquiry, IV FERC Stats.
and Regs.  35,518 at 35,628 (1985), order terminating docket, 61 FERC  61,371 (1992), defined the term
``coordination transactions,'' and distinguished coordination transactions from requirements transactions.

EEI opposes case-by-case treatment of rate recovery of emissions allowances in coordination transactions. It argues
that a case-by-case approach would unduly burden the Commission with hundreds of virtually identical proceedings
that can be more efficiently addressed through the policy statement approach it advocates here. EEI maintains that
it is not seeking to expand the meaning of defined contract terms, but simply to include in existing contract terms
costs that are reasonable and contractually permissible. EEI recognizes the need for special treatment of generating
units subject to the requirements of reduced utilization in the CAAA, and that exceptions to the use of the full incremental
costs of emissions allowances associated with those generating units may take place. However, EEI believes that
its proposal adequately responds to Wisconsin Electric's concerns in this area because it allows exceptions to full
incremental costs as long as dispatch criteria and the coordination rates are consistent. 

EEI further states that the Commission should not designate any specific index because such action would hinder market
competition in allowance trading. It characterizes as unnecessary and burdensome Clean Air's proposals that energy
sellers certify an unaffiliated third party to provide allowances to a power purchaser, and that utilities be required
to report the volume and price of allowance trades for publication by this Commission. Finally, EEI argues that this
is not the appropriate proceeding to specify particular revenue credit treatment of allowance-related revenues.
EEI submits that revenue credits with respect to coordination transactions are specified either in agreements between
retail and wholesale customer groups and utility companies or are required under the retail and wholesale practices
of state commissions or this Commission. Thus, EEI argues, revenue credits are appropriately dealt with in rate cases,
rather than in a policy proceeding. 



Discussion 



Use of Incremental Costs 



We will allow the recovery of incremental costs of emission allowances in coordination rates whenever the coordination
rate also provides for recovery of other variable costs on an incremental basis. EEI's proposal that the incremental
cost of emissions allowances be recovered in coordination rates will ensure, under many coordination rate schedules,
consistency with the way in which other costs (

e.g.

, fuel) are recovered and with dispatch decisions. In response to APPA's concern that the scope of the transactions
affected by the Policy Statement is not clearly defined in EEI's proposal, the Commission wishes to make clear that
the policy adopted here will apply only when a coordination rate expressly provides for the recovery of incremental
costs or if stated rates are designed to recover incremental costs. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental
cost pricing for other costs (

e.g.

, coordination transactions that are designed as unit sales where the rates track the costs of a particular unit or
coordination rates that are designed to recover average costs), the Commission will require the seller to propose
an alternative costing method for emissions allowances, or demonstrate that any inconsistency between the proposed
costing method and the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission finds that the cost
to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish incremental cost.

29

 





Use of Indices 



We will adopt EEI's proposal that sellers be permitted to choose their own index or a combination of indices. Because
the emission allowance markets are still developing, the Commission cannot, at this time, conclude that any particular
index should be utilized. Our primary concern in allowing the selling utility to choose the index or indices is that,
if there are variations in the available indices, the seller will select the one with the highest price at the time of
the transaction, rather than the index that best reflects the incremental cost. EEI's proposal guards against this
practice because it provides the customer with the option to supply its own allowances rather than purchase allowances
from a selling utility. 



Dispatch 



EEI's proposal is based on sellers' use of the same index for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions.
If the seller does not use the same index for both purposes, EEI proposes that the seller be required to reconcile the
differences. 

The Commission will adopt this proposal. The purpose of any dispatch criterion is to meet each increment of load from
the increment of generation with the lowest running costs (fuel, other variable operating expenses and, now, emissions
allowances). If the seller is not using the same cost index in its dispatch decisions as it is proposing for pricing
its coordination sales, we cannot rely upon the index to reflect incremental cost.

30

 Accordingly, sellers must explain and justify any differences in their use of different incremental cost references
for dispatch and pricing.

Calculation of Amount of Emissions Allowances Associated With a Transaction 



The Commission will also adopt EEI's proposal that sellers explain how they will compute the amount of emissions allowances
that will be attributed to each coordination transaction. The amount of emissions allowances related to a coordination
sale will vary based on the unit used for pricing, the amount of energy generated and the type of fuel used. The Commission
expects that the generating unit used to compute the emission allowance amount would be the same unit that is used to
price the incremental fuel component of the coordination rate. Also, the seller should explain how fractional amounts
will be handled. While a customer choosing the cash compensation method could pay for part of an allowance, the customer
cannot choose to return part of an allowance. To resolve this problem, utilities could adopt a ``rounding'' approach,


i.e.

, rounding up to the next whole number if the fraction is greater than one half, or down if the fraction is less than one-half.
If a rounding approach is used for the return of allowances in kind, it should also be used for cash settlements so that
there is no bias for or against the return in kind option. 



Timing 



The Commission also adopts EEI's proposal that utilities provide details on the timing of opportunities to return
allowances or stipulate whether they will purchase or return allowances. Customers should be able to take advantage
of possible cost savings resulting from the timing of allowance settlements.

32

 This can be accomplished by allowing customers that choose to provide allowances in kind to do so by the appropriate
EPA reporting date

33

 rather than at the time of the transaction, 

i.e.

, a ``timing option.'' Thus, allowance customers will have the same opportunities as allowance sellers and face the
same consequences, 

i.e.

, possible cost savings or additional costs.

34

 







We note, however, that EEI's proposal addresses timing options only with respect to longer-term transactions. In
our opinion, timing options should be available for all transactions since the seller's timing flexibility is the
same regardless of the length of the transaction. 



Other Factors That Impact Rates 



The Commission adopts EEI's proposal that sellers specify any other factors that may affect pricing. For example,
many utilities have coordination rates that allow a reservation charge based on a unit other than the unit used to generate
energy as long as the total revenues do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of the unit used for pricing.

35

 Utilities which operate under this type of ceiling will have to clarify that the variable cost component includes
the emissions allowance amount associated with the unit used to establish the ceiling. 





Other Rate Issues Raised by Intervenors 



The Commission will not expand the scope of this Policy Statement beyond what EEI has proposed. The ratemaking treatment
for coordination, requirements and affiliated pooling arrangements must recognize the differences in the character
of the service arrangements. Furthermore, the timing of any ratemaking implementation will, of necessity, be different.
For instance, because in requirements service the cost of emissions allowances will be a very small percentage of
a utility's overall costs, a utility may choose not to address emissions allowance costs in requirements rates until
it files its next general rate case. 

Also, since requirements customers typically pay a 

pro rata 

share of all of a utility's prudently incurred costs and utilities may choose various methods to comply with the CAAA,
it would be difficult, if not impossible, to establish a generic policy that would be appropriate for all requirements
service. Likewise, since operating agreements between affiliate utilities are not uniform, it would be difficult
to establish a generic ratemaking policy for affiliated pooling arrangements. Affiliate agreements also may reflect
compromises to satisfy the concerns of state regulators.

36

 





Conversely, the pricing of coordination transactions is fairly standardized, generally reflecting an energy charge
equal to incremental costs and a reservation charge providing a contribution to the fixed costs of the units used to
price the energy. Thus, the treatment of emissions allowances in coordination rates can be readily addressed in a
generic fashion. 

In accordance with Florida Power's request, we state that Phase II utilities are not now required to make rate filings
detailing their emission allowance treatment for coordination transactions that will not be affected until the
year 2000. Such filings would be due no more than 120 or less than 60 days prior to Phase II. 

The intervenors have raised concerns regarding the crediting of allowance related revenues to requirements rates
or the allocation of emissions allowances between retail and wholesale requirements jurisdictions. It will be our
policy to treat the revenues from allowances sold as part of coordination sales the same way we treat other revenues
from coordination sales. In other words, to the extent, and in the same way that, the latter revenues are credited to
jurisdictional customers, so should the former revenues. However, we will address implementation of this policy
in the context of individual requirements rate proceedings, or, if appropriate, complaint proceedings. In section
205 proceedings, utilities will be expected to fully support their test year projections for emission allowances
associated with coordination sales. 

We reject Clean Air's requests that the Commission require sellers to report the volume and price of allowances transferred
and publish this information, and that sellers certify unaffiliated third parties to provide allowances to a customer.
Sellers must, of course, be prepared to document the calculation of all aspects of their rates, including the emissions
allowance component. However, an extensive reporting requirement and third-party certification would be costly
and time consuming, and there is no basis to conclude that imposition of this burden on utilities would enhance the
development of the emission allowance trading markets. 



Use of Alternate Rate Treatments 



Finally, the Commission notes that this Policy Statement contains general guidelines on ratemaking treatment in
coordination rates for the cost of emissions allowances. It is not intended to preclude utilities or other interested
parties, such as state commissions, from proposing alternate rate treatments for consideration on a case-by-case
basis.

V. Implementation Procedures 


In the Interim Rule accompanying the Policy Statement, the Commission also adopts EEI's proposal that if utilities
have rate schedules on file that expressly provide for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, these
utilities should be allowed to make abbreviated rate filings, limited to detailing how they would recover emissions
allowance costs. These filings should include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used, the method
by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated, timing procedures, how inconsistencies, if any, with
dispatch criteria will be reconciled, and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. These filings would constitute
rate schedule amendments under FPA section 205 since they would describe how the rates are computed. Utilities making
such abbreviated filings should: (1) clearly identify the filing as being limited to amendments to coordination
rates to reflect the costs of emissions allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying
the filing, (2) submit a document that can be inserted into each rate schedule and (3) identify each rate schedule to
which the amendment applies. Finally, the abbreviated filing should apply consistent treatment to all coordination
rate schedules or the filing utility should justify its failure to do so. 

Regarding coordination rates that do not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs,
 we conclude that the seller may include rate schedule amendments together with the abbreviated filing discussed
above if the customer agrees to the rate change. If the customer does not agree to revise such rates, the utility should
tender its emission allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal. This
will ensure that the processing of uncontested rate filings is not delayed by disputes over individual agreements.






Finally, APPA expresses concern that affected parties be afforded an opportunity to challenge application of the
policy announced herein on a case-by-case basis. APPA's concerns are satisfied because, in all cases, the filings
would be noticed and customers provided an opportunity to comment. 



45-Day Amendment Period 



The Commission adopts EEI's proposal that utilities be allowed to implement the policy announced herein on January
1, 1995, but make the filings discussed above within 45 days after the Commission issues an order in this proceeding.
In return for granting waiver of notice, the utilities must agree that revenues will be collected subject to refund
pending Commission action. Utilities making such filings should include a statement in the first paragraph of their
transmittal letter agreeing to the refund condition with respect to allowance-related charges assessed between
January 1, 1995, and the date the Commission issues an order accepting the filing without investigation or hearing.




VI. Information Collection Statement 



The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13 require that OMB approve certain information
and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements in this policy statement
are contained in FERC-516 ``Electric Rate Schedule Filings'' (1902-0096). 

The Commission is issuing this Policy Statement and Interim Rule with the information requirements to carry out its
regulatory responsibilities under the Federal Power Act to determine the appropriate ratemaking treatment of sulfur
dioxide emissions allowances in coordination transactions. 

The Policy Statement and Interim Rule provide guidance to public utilities on the ratemaking treatment of emissions
allowances in coordination transactions in order that the CAAA emissions allowance program will be implemented
in accordance with the Congressional mandate. The Commission's Office of Electric Power Regulation uses the data
for determination for the reasonableness and justness of costs for emissions allowances when a public utility seeks
to pass through its costs in wholesale rates. These collections of information are intended to be the minimum elements
needed for utilities to file amendments to their rate schedules. 

The Commission is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget a notification of these proposed collections
of information. Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information
Services Division, (202) 208-1415]. Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, D.C. 20503, (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)
FAX: (202) 395-5167. 




VII. Public Comment Procedures 






The Commission invites interested persons to submit additional written comments on the matters addressed in this
Interim Rule. An original and 14 copies of the comments must be filed with the Commission no later than January 23, 1995.
Comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, and should refer to Docket No. PL95-1-000. 

All other written comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for public inspection
in the Commission's Public Reference Room at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20426, during regular
business hours. 






VIII. Effective Date 






This Policy Statement and Interim Rule are effective January 1, 1995. Because Phase I of the CAAA begins January 1,
1995, public utilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction need to have in place as of that date a method of recovery
in rates of the cost of emissions allowances used in coordination transactions. For that reason the Commission finds
good cause to make the Interim Rule effective without prior notice and comment, and finds good cause to make the Interim
Rule effective on less than 30 days' notice.

In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission amends Part 2 and Part 35 of Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations
as set forth below. 


PART 2_GENERAL POLICY AND INTERPRETATIONS 


1. The authority citation for Part 2 continues to read as follows: 






Authority: 

15 U.S.C. 717-717w, 3301-3432; 16 U.S.C. 792-825y, 2601-2645; 42 U.S.C. 4321-4361,
7101-7352. 




2. Part 2 is amended by adding  2.25, to read as follows: 


 2.25 

Ratemaking Treatment of the Cost of Emissions Allowances in Coordination Transactions. 


(a) 

General Policy. 

This Statement of Policy is adopted in furtherance of the goals of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub.
L. 101-549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990). 
(b) 

Costing Emissions Allowances in Coordination Sales. 

If a public utility's coordination rate on file with the Commission provides for recovery of variable costs on an incremental
basis, the Commission will allow recovery of the incremental costs of emissions allowances associated with a coordination
sale. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental costs, the public utility should propose alternative allowance
costing methods or demonstrate that the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission
finds that the cost to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish the incremental cost. 
(c) 

Use of Indices. 

The Commission will allow public utilities to determine emissions allowance costs on the basis of an index or combination
of indices of the current price of emissions allowances, provided that the public utility affords purchasing utilities
the option of providing emissions allowances. Public utilities should explain and justify any use of different incremental
cost indices for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions. 
(d) 

Calculation of Amount of Emissions Allowances Associated With Coordination Transactions. 

Public utilities should explain the methods used to compute the amount of emissions allowances included in coordination
transactions. 
(e) 

Timing. 

Public utilities should provide information to purchasing utilities regarding the timing of opportunities for
purchasers to stipulate whether they will purchase or return emissions allowances. 
(f) 

Other Costing Methods Not Precluded. 

The ratemaking treatment of emissions allowance costs endorsed in this Policy Statement does not preclude other
approaches proposed by individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. 


PART 35_FILING OF RATE SCHEDULES 


1. The authority citation for Part 35 continues to read as follows: 






Authority: 

16 U.S.C. 791a-825r, 2601-2645; 31 U.S.C. 9701; 42 U.S.C. 7101-7352. 




2. Section 35 is amended by adding Section 35.23, to read as follows: 


 35.23 

General Provisions. 


(a) 

Applicability. 

This subpart applies to any wholesale sale of electric energy in a coordination transaction by a public utility if
that sale requires the use of an emissions allowance. 
(b) 

Implementation Procedures. 

(1) If a public utility has a coordination rate schedule on file that expressly provides for the recovery of all incremental
or out-of-pocket costs, such utility may make an abbreviated rate filing detailing how it will recover emissions
allowance costs. Such filing must include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used; the method
by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated; timing procedures; how inconsistencies, if any, with
dispatch criteria will be reconciled; and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. In addition, a utility making
an abbreviated filing must:
(i) clearly identify the filing as being limited to an amendment to a coordination rate to reflect the cost of emissions
allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying the filing;
(ii) submit revised pages that can be inserted into each rate schedule; and
(iii) identify each rate schedule to which the amendment applies.
(2) The abbreviated filing must apply consistent treatment to all coordination rate schedules. If the filing does
not apply consistent rate treatment, the public utility must explain why it does not do so. 
(3) If a public utility wants to charge incremental costs for emissions allowances, but its rate schedule on file with
the Commission does not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, the selling public utility may submit an
abbreviated filing if all customers agree to the rate change. If customers do not agree, the selling public utility
must tender its emissions allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal.

Sulfiting Agents; Withdrawal of Regulation Revoking Gras Status for Use on ``Fresh'' Potatoes Served or Sold Unpackaged
and Unlabeled to Consumers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing a final rule that revoked the generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
listing of sulfiting agents (i.e., sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium and potassium bisulfite, and sodium and
potassium metabisulfite) on ``fresh'' potatoes that are intended to be served or sold unpackaged and unlabeled to
the consumer. The agency is revising its regulations in accordance with the withdrawal. This action is being taken
in response to a court ruling.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 15, 1990 (55 FR 9826), FDA published a final rule that amended the GRAS regulations to revoke GRAS status for
the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes. The rule was challenged by the ``fresh'' potato industry and invalidated
by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on procedural grounds; subsequently, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, i.e., the full court, heard the case and, by an equally divided
vote, let the district court's decision stand. In accordance with the court's ruling, the agency is withdrawing the
revocation of GRAS status for the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes and is revising 
  182.3616, 182.3637, 182.3739, 182.3766, 182.3798, and 182.3862 (21 U.S.C. 182.3616, 182.3637, 182.3639,
182.3766, 182.3798, and 182.3862) accordingly. 




Because the issuance of this document is in response to a court order, FDA finds that providing notice and public comment
prior to the publication of this final rule is unnecessary and may therefore be dispensed with for good cause under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Therefore, publication of this rule withdrawing the revocation of GRAS status for use of sulfiting
agents on ``fresh'' potatoes constitutes final action. The agency advises, however, that it has continuing concerns
about the safety of this use of sulfiting agents and is considering further action.

ACTION:

 Temporary regulations. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains temporary regulations relating to the income tax withholding requirement on distributions
of profits from certain gaming activities made to members of Indian tribes under section 3402(r) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986. The regulations reflect changes to the law made by section 701 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Those
affected by the regulations are persons, including Indian tribes, making payments to members of Indian tribes from
net revenues of certain gaming activities conducted or licensed by the tribes. Also affected are members of Indian
tribes who receive the payments. The text of these temporary regulations also serves as the text of the proposed regulations
set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking on this subject in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the 

Federal Register

.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


This document contains amendments to the Employment Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 31) under section 3402(r). Section
3402(r) was added by section 701 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which approved the trade agreements resulting
from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) and the Statement of Administrative Action to implement the Agreements. 
Section 3402(r) requires that persons, including Indian tribes, making payments to members of Indian tribes from
the net revenues of certain gaming activities conducted or licensed by the tribes deduct and withhold income taxes
from those payments. These regulations provide guidance on how to comply with the new withholding requirement. 


Explanation of Provisions 


Net revenue from certain gaming activities conducted or licensed by an Indian tribe may be used to make taxable distributions
to members of the Indian tribe. The tribe must notify its members of the tax liability at the time the payments are made.
25 U.S.C. 2710(b)(3) and (d)(1). Under prior law, the tribe was not required to withhold on such payments except to
the extent backup withholding rules applied under section 3406. 
Distributions of net revenues from gaming activity by an Indian tribe may result in significant tax liability to the
tribe's members. Withholding on such payments is intended to approximate ultimate tax liability. For some tribal
members, this withholding may eliminate the need to make quarterly estimated tax payments. For others, it will reduce
the likelihood that they will face penalties for underpayment of tax. 
Section 3402(r) generally requires that, for payments made after December 31, 1994, persons, including Indian tribes,
making payments to members of Indian tribes from the net revenues of certain gaming activities conducted or licensed
by the tribes deduct and withhold income taxes from those payments. 
This regulation provides for the amounts to be withheld to be determined under the applicable table. Upon publication
of this regulation, the IRS will make available tables for withholding on distributions to tribal members in 1995.

Section 3402(r)(5) requires that payments be placed on an annualized basis under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
While these regulations provide a method for placing payments on an annualized basis, it will ordinarily not be necessary
to annualize the payments, because the tables provided by the IRS reflect the annualized payment in prescribing the
amount to be withheld. 
Section 3402(r)(6) provides that, at the election of an Indian tribe, the tax imposed by section 3402(r) on any payment
made by such tribe shall be determined in accordance with such tables or computational procedures as may be specified
in regulations. This regulation allows withholding under section 3402(r) pursuant to any tables or procedures,
provided that the amount of tax withheld is substantially the same as it would be using the tables provided by the IRS
pursuant to section 3402(r). No written election is required. 
Section 3402(p)(2) authorizes the Secretary to provide in regulations for withholding from payments other than
wages if the person making the payment and the person receiving the payment agree to the withholding. This regulation
provides that additional withholding is permitted where a tribal member and a tribe enter into a voluntary withholding
agreement. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on their impact on small business.

The principal author of the regulations is Rebecca Wilson, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits
and Exempt Organizations). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their
development. 



List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 31 



Employment taxes, Income taxes, Penalties, Pensions, Railroad retirement, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,
Social security, Unemployment compensation. 



Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations 



Accordingly, 26 CFR part 31 is amended as follows: 



PART 31_EMPLOYMENT TAXES AND COLLECTION OF INCOME TAX AT SOURCE 





Paragraph 1. 

The authority citation for part 31 is amended by adding an entry in numerical order to read as follows: 






Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * 




Section 31.3402(r)-1T also issued under 26 U.S.C. 3402 (p)(2) and (r). * * * 



Par. 2. 

Section 31.3402(r)-1T is added to read as follows: 

 31.3402(r)-1T Withholding on distributions of Indian gaming profits to tribal members (temporary).


(a)(1) General rule. 

Section 3402(r)(1) requires every person, including an Indian tribe, making a payment to a member of an Indian tribe
from the net revenues of any class II or class III gaming activity, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 2703, conducted or licensed
by such tribe to deduct and withhold from such payment a tax in an amount equal to such payment's proportionate share
of the annualized tax, as that term is defined in section 3402(r)(3). 

(2) 

Withholding tables. 

Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the amount of a payment's proportionate share of the annualized
tax shall be determined under the applicable table provided by the Commissioner. 

(3) 

Annualized amount of payment. 

Section 3402(r)(5) provides that payments shall be placed on an annualized basis under regulations prescribed by
the Secretary. A payment may be placed on an annualized basis by multiplying the amount of the payment by the total number
of payments to be made in a calendar year. For example, a monthly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount
of the payment by 12. Similarly, a quarterly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount of the payment by 4.


(4) 

Alternate withholding procedures

_(i) 

In general. 

Any procedure for determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under section 3402(r) may be used, provided that
the amount of tax deducted and withheld is substantially the same as it would be using the tables provided by the Commissioner
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. At the election of an Indian tribe, the tax imposed by section 3402(r) shall
be determined in accordance with this alternate procedure. 

(ii) 

Method of election. 

It is sufficient for purposes of making an election under this paragraph (a)(4) that an Indian tribe evidence the election
in any reasonable way, including use of a particular method. Thus, no written election is required. 

(5) 

Additional withholding permitted. 

Consistent with the provisions of section 3402(p)(2), a tribal member and a tribe may enter into an agreement to provide
for the deduction and withholding of additional amounts from payments in order to satisfy the anticipated tax liability
of the tribal member. The agreement may be made in a manner similar to that described in  31.3402(p)-1 (with
respect to voluntary withholding agreements between employees and employers). 

(b) 

Effective date. 

This section applies to payments made after December 31, 1994.

28 CFR Part 2 
Paroling, Recommitting, and Supervising Federal Prisoners: Salient Factor Scoring 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Parole Commission, Justice. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Parole Commission is clarifying its paroling policy guidelines on using a prior conviction for determining
a prisoner's salient factor score, when the prisoner claims the conviction was obtained in violation of his right
to counsel, and the records of the conviction are not available. This amendment of the salient factor score instructions
was published as an interim rule on March 10, 1994. 59 FR 11185-86. The final version of the rule is almost identical
to the interim rule. The rule provides that the prisoner must demonstrate that the allegedly invalid conviction must
have occurred prior to Supreme Court decisions establishing the right to counsel for felony and misdemeanor/petty
offense convictions. Otherwise, the Commission will presume that the prior conviction was validly obtained and
will count the conviction even if records of the conviction are no longer available. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The rationale for this revision of the salient factor scoring manual is provided in the supplementary information
for the interim rule. 59 FR 11185-86. Several comments were received in response to the publication of the interim
rule. One federal defender argued that the interim rule was unfair because if the records of the prior conviction are
not available, the limited information the Commission had about the prior conviction was presumptively unreliable.
But the mere fact that the records of the conviction are no longer available should not lead to the inference that the
conviction did not occur or was obtained using invalid procedures. More likely, the absence of the records would be
caused by their destruction or retirement according to a practice of purging court files on a regular schedule. Another
person asked the Commission to postpone action on the new rule until it assessed to what extent tribal courts have implemented
a defendant's right to counsel. The Commission decided that the promulgation of this rule_which was intended to promptly
clarify its salient factor scoring instruction at Item A, paragraph A.8_should not be deferred for the task of re-examining
tribal court procedures and determining whether a change in a separate instruction at paragraph A.10 should also
be made. 



Several editorial changes were made in the interim rule. Also, in the final rule the Commission clarifies that the
prisoner would have to claim that he served a jail term for a non-felony, pre-1973 conviction before the Commission
would decline to count such a conviction in salient factor scoring. If the prisoner had not served a jail term for such
a conviction, the conviction would be constitutionally valid even if obtained in violation of his right to counsel.

v.

 Hamlin,

 407 U.S. 25 (1972). 



Implementation 



This rule will be applied at all hearings and record reviews (including reviews of appeals to the National Appeals
Board), conducted on or after the effective date. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Statement 



The U.S. Parole Commission has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of
Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This
rule will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities, within the meaning of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

<DOCTITLE>Paroling, Recommitting, and Supervising Federal Prisoners: Sex Offenses Against Minors Age 12 and Older</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Parole Commission, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Parole Commission is adding to its guidelines, under the heading of ``Carnal Knowledge or Sodomy Involving
Minors'' a provision increasing the offense severity rating from Category Four to Category Seven for any crime involving
an adult offender who has abused a position of trust (

e.g.

, teacher, counselor, or physician), or who has engaged in predatory sexual behavior. The purpose of this guideline
amendment is to clarify the aggravated nature of such crimes in relation to all other offenses that involve non-forcible
sexual relations between an adult and a minor age 12 or older. This item was published as a proposed rule on May 20, 1994.
59 FR 26466. The guideline increase follows a Congressional directive that, when the Commission frequently exceeds
the guidelines in a particular type of case, the guidelines should be amended to provide for consistency in such decisions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Federal parole laws remain in effect until November 1, 1997, for prisoners and parolees who committed their crimes
prior to November 1, 1987, and whose sentences place them under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Parole Commission. See
Section 235(b) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1987, Public Law 98-473 (as amended) and 18 U.S.C. 4201 through
4218. The Paroling Policy Guidelines at 28 CFR 2.20 provide consistency in Parole Commission decision-making for
such offenders. 



The proposed rule would increase the prison time to be served in cases where the adult has committed such an offense
through an abuse of a position of trust, or through predatory behavior. Whereas ordinary offenses involving non-forcible
sexual relations between adults and minors age 12 or older are rated Category Four on the guidelines, offenses involving
abuse of trust or predatory behavior were proposed for a Category Seven rating. One public comment was received on
this proposal from the U.S. Probation Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina supporting the proposal.


After a careful review of its decision-making practices, the Commission has decided that the proposal merits adoption
as a final rule. The increase to Category Seven reflects optimum Commission decision-making practice, which is to
order an upward departure from the guideline range for a Category Four offense if the offender has abused a significant
position of trust or has behaved in a predatory manner toward multiple victims. Such circumstances would constitute
good cause to exceed the guidelines pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4206(c). An abuse of trust would be exemplified by a child
psychiatrist who engages in sodomy with youthful patients under his care, a high school teacher who seduces a student
in his classroom, or a religious counselor who has sexual relations with teenage members of his congregation. Predatory
behavior is defined as the repeated use of tricks or other devices to lure unsuspecting youthful victims into sexual
relations with an adult offender. 



Implementation



This rule will be applied at all initial and revocation hearings held on or after the effective date. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Statement 



The U.S. Parole Commission has determined that this proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes
of Executive Order 12866, and the rule has therefore not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule
will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities, within the meaning of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 



List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 2

The Final Rule 



Accordingly, the U.S. Parole Commission makes the following amendment to 28 CFR Part 2:

Modifications to Role of National Labor Relations Board's Administrative Law Judges Including: Assignment of Administrative
Law Judges as Settlement Judges; Discretion of Administrative Law Judges to Dispense With Briefs, To Hear Oral Argument
in Lieu of Briefs, and To Issue Bench Decisions 

 

<AGENCY>

 National Labor Relations Board.

 

 </AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Experimental modification of rules. 

 



 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issues a document that it will begin a one-year experimental modification
of its rules with respect to the role that its Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) play in facilitating the expeditious
resolution of unfair labor practice proceedings. During the experimental period, the NLRB will amend its rules to
give the Chief Administrative Law Judge discretion to assign a judge other than the trial judge to conduct settlement
negotiations with the parties, and to give the settlement judge certain powers necessary to engage effectively in
those settlement efforts. The NLRB will also, during the experimental period, modify its rules to give ALJs assigned
to hear a case the discretion to dispense with briefs, to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs, and to issue bench decisions.
The rule changes will expire at the end of the one-year experimental period absent renewal by the Board.

 

 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 On September 8, 1994, the Board issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) which proposed certain modifications
to the Board's rules to permit the assignment of ALJs to serve as settlement judges, and to provide ALJs with the discretion
to dispense with briefs, to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs, and to issue bench decisions (59 FR 46375). The NPR
provided for a comment period ending October 7, 1994. 

 

The Board received eight written comments on the NPR. The comments were received from a variety of sources, including
unions, employer associations, practitioners, and the academic community. The comments were mixed, with some supporting
some of the proposals but not others, and others supporting none of the proposals. Having carefully considered these
comments, for the reasons discussed below, the Board has decided to implement the proposed changes with certain modifications
for a one-year experimental period. 

 

I. Settlement Judges 

 

The proposal on the use of settlement judges proposed to amend  102.35 of the Board's rules to include provisions
for the assignment of ALJs to serve as settlement judges. The comments on this proposal were mixed, with two comments
opposing the proposal, two comments supporting the proposal, and two comments suggesting that the proposal be modified
to require the agreement of the parties. (The other two comments made no comment on the proposal.) 

 The comments opposing the proposal generally expressed the view that the proposal was unneeded and unlikely to yield
significant benefits given the Agency's already high settlement rate. The comment submitted by the AFL-CIO
also expressed the concern that the proposal would diminish the availability of trial judges, cause the postponement
of hearing dates, and have a negative effect on settlement discussion at the Regional level. 

 The Board acknowledges that there are potential problems which could arise with the use of settlement judges. The
proposed rules, however, were drafted to minimize any such problems by requiring the assigning judge to consider,
among other factors, the likelihood that a settlement may occur, the good faith of any person making a request for assignment
of a settlement judge, and whether the assignment is otherwise feasible. The Board indicated in the NPR that among
the factors which the assigning judge could consider would be the effect of an assignment upon agency resources, whether
the assignment is being sought for, or would have the effect of, delaying the proceeding, and whether the assignment
might tend to undermine other pending settlement efforts. 

 As suggested by some of the comments, a further safeguard against abuse of the procedure would be to condition the use
of settlement judges on the agreement of all parties. The proposed rule did not include such a condition or otherwise
permit a party to veto the use of the procedure, but indicated that a party's opposition was a factor for the assigning
judge to consider in assessing whether to appoint a settlement judge. Having considered the comments, however, the
Board agrees that the rule should state clearly that the procedure should not be used unless the parties agree to it.
This should further minimize the potential for problems of the kind discussed by the AFL-CIO. 

 In view of the Agency's lack of experience with settlement judges, however, the Board has decided to implement the
procedure at this time for a one-year trial period. If significant problems arise with the procedure during that period,
those problems may be considered by the Board in considering whether to implement the changes permanently.

II. Briefs, Oral Argument, Recommendations, and Bench Decisions


As part of its ongoing review of ways in which unfair labor practice proceedings can be revamped to move the cases more
expeditiously, the Board proposed to give its ALJs the discretion, in appropriate cases, to dispense with post-hearing
briefs or proposed findings and conclusions, to hear oral argument, and to issue bench decisions. These changes were
proposed in the form of amendments to  102.35(j) (renumbered to  102.35(b)(10)),  102.42, and
 102.45(a) of the Board's Rules and Regulations.
Of the eight comments received, two generally supported or did not oppose these changes, while the remaining comments
generally opposed the changes. The comments opposing the changes generally expressed the concern that dispensing
with post-hearing briefs and issuing bench decisions would be prejudicial to respondents given the absence of pretrial
discovery in Board proceedings, and would result in lower quality ALJ decisions leading to further litigation.
As with the settlement-judge proposal, the Board recognizes that problems could arise under the proposed changes
if not properly utilized. As the Board noted in the NPR, many cases are not suitable for these expedited procedures,
and if inappropriate cases were selected, the resulting remands could delay the final disposition of the cases.
As indicated in the NPR, however, the Board believes that if ALJs choose the cases carefully, the benefits of expediting
those cases would outweigh any problems arising in other cases where the procedures are improvidently utilized.
In order to provide some guidance to the ALJs in this regard, the Board in the NPR suggested certain types of cases in
which it may be appropriate to dispense with briefs and/or to issue bench decisions, such as cases that turn on a very
straightforward credibility issue; cases involving one-day hearings; cases involving a well-settled legal issue
where there is no dispute as to the facts; short record single-issue cases; or cases in which a party defaults by not
appearing at the hearing. The Board indicates that in more complex cases, including cases with lengthy records, these
procedures would likely not be appropriate.

The Board continues to believe that the proposed changes would be beneficial if properly implemented in accordance
with the cautions and guidance expressed by the Board in the NPR. However, in view of the Agency's lack of experience
with such procedures, as with the settlement-judge proposal, the Board has decided to implement the procedure at
this time for a one-year trial period.
As the dissent states, the Board has held that a judge's issuance of an oral decision did ``not satisfactorily compl[y]
with the requirements of Section 10(c) of the National Labor Regulations Act, as amended, and Section 102.45 of the
Board's Rules and Regulations, as amended, with regard to the preparation of a written decision.'' See 

Local Union No. 195, Plumbers (Stone & Webster Engineering Corp.), 

237 NLRB 931, 931 (1978). See also 

Plastic Film Products Corp

., 232 NLRB 722, 722 (1977). It is clear, however, that it is the Board's regulations, and not Section 10(c) of the Act,
which has been the obstacle to such decision. See 

id

. at fn 1 in both cases (Member Murphy concurring). Indeed, in a subsequent case, a different panel of the Board, which
included one of our dissenting colleagues, upheld an oral decision by a judge. See 

Jumbo Produce, 

294 NLRB 998, 998-999 (1989) (rejecting General Counsel's contention that ALJ's dismissal of an 8(a)(1) allegation
at the hearing was ``procedurally incorrect'' under 

Stone & Webster 

``because he did not issue a written decision,'' inasmuch as the judge had allowed the General Counsel to present his
legal and factual arguments and had stated on the record the reasons for his findings). The rule changes which we adopt
today on an experimental basis are designed to remove any regulatory obstacle which may exist in light of the Board's
decisions in 

Stone & Webster 

and 

Plastic Film Products 

and are fully consistent with the Board's decision in 

Jumbo Produce

.
In any event, the new provisions on bench decisions do not violate Section 10(c). Section 102.45 of the rules, as amended,
provides that all decisions, including bench decisions, must contain findings of fact, conclusions, and the reasons
or basis therefor upon all material issues of fact and law, as well as a recommended order, including affirmative provisions,
all as required by Section 10(c). The amendments to  102.45 of the rules provide that the administrative law
judge will certify the accuracy of the pages of the transcript which contain the decision and shall cause those pages
to be served on the parties and filed with the Board. Thus, these provisions provide for a written decision, in the form
of a certified copy of the record pages containing the judge's full decision, which is served on the parties, in full
compliance with the provisions of Section 10(c) of the Act. To the extent that the decisions in 

Stone & Webster 

and 

Plastic Film Products 

suggest otherwise, we conclude that they are based on a misreading of the requirements of Section 10(c), and they are
overruled by the new provisions of the Rules.
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) the NLRB certifies that these rules will not have
a significant impact on small business entities.

2. Section 102.35 is revised to read as follows: 



 102.35 



Duties and powers of administrative law judges; assignment and powers of settlement judges. 



(a) It shall be the duty of the administrative law judge to inquire fully into the facts as to whether the respondent
has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice affecting commerce as set forth in the complaint or amended
complaint. The administrative law judge shall have authority, with respect to cases assigned to him, between the
time he is designated and transfer of the case to the Board, subject to the Rules and Regulations of the Board and within
its powers: 

(1) To administer oaths and affirmations; 

(2) To grant applications for subpoenas; 

(3) To rule upon petitions to revoke subpoenas; 

(4) To rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence; 

(5) To take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of justice would be served thereby; 

(6) To regulate the course of the hearing and, if appropriate or necessary, to exclude persons or counsel from the hearing
for contemptuous conduct and to strike all related testimony of witnesses refusing to answer any proper question;


(7) To hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties, but not to adjust
cases; 

(8) To dispose of procedural requests, motions, or similar matters, including motions referred to the administrative
law judge by the Regional Director and motions for summary judgment or to amend pleadings; also to dismiss complaints
or portions thereof; to order hearings reopened; and upon motion order proceedings consolidated or severed prior
to issuance of administrative law judge decisions; 

(9) To approve a stipulation voluntarily entered into by all parties to the case which will dispense with a verbatim
written transcript of record of the oral testimony adduced at the hearing, and which will also provide for the waiver
by the respective parties of their right to file with the Board exceptions to the findings of fact (but not to conclusions
of law or recommended orders) which the administrative law judge shall make in his decisions; 

(10) To make and file decisions, including bench decisions delivered within 72 hours after conclusion of oral argument,
in conformity with Public Law 89-554, 5 U.S.C. 557; 

(11) To call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses and to introduce into the record documentary or other evidence;


(12) To request the parties at any time during the hearing to state their respective positions concerning any issue
in the case or theory in support thereof; 

(13) To take any other action necessary under the foregoing and authorized by the published Rules and Regulations
of the Board. 

(b) Upon the request of any party or the judge assigned to hear a case, or on his or her own motion, the chief administrative
law judge in Washington, DC, the deputy chief judge in San Francisco, the associate chief judge in Atlanta, or the associate
chief judge in New York may assign a judge who shall be other than the trial judge to conduct settlement negotiations.
In exercising his or her discretion, the chief, deputy chief, or associate chief judge making the assignment will
consider, among other factors, whether there is reason to believe that resolution of the dispute is likely, the request
for assignment of a settlement judge is made in good faith, and the assignment is otherwise feasible. 

Provided,

 however, that no such assignment shall be made absent the agreement of all parties to the use of this procedure. 

(1) The settlement judge shall convene and preside over conferences and settlement negotiations between the parties,
assess the practicalities of a potential settlement, and report to the chief, deputy, or associate the status of settlement
negotiations, recommending continuation or termination of the settlement negotiations. Where feasible, settlement
conferences shall be held in person. 

(2) The settlement judge may require that the attorney or other representative for each party be present at settlement
conferences and that the parties or agents with full settlement authority also be present or available by telephone.


(3) Participation of the settlement judge shall terminate upon the order of the chief, deputy, or associates issued
after consultation with the settlement judge. The conduct of settlement negotiations shall not unduly delay the
hearing. 

(4) All discussions between the parties and the settlement judge shall be confidential. The settlement judge shall
not discuss any aspect of the case with the trial judge, and no evidence regarding statements, conduct, offers of settlement,
and concessions of the parties made in proceedings before the settlement judge shall be admissible in any proceeding
before the Board, except by stipulation of the parties. Documents disclosed in the settlement process may not be used
in litigation unless voluntarily produced or obtained pursuant to subpoena. 

(5) No decision of a chief, deputy, or associate concerning the assignment of a settlement judge or the termination
of a settlement judge's assignment shall be appealable to the Board.

(6) Any settlement reached under the auspices of a settlement judge shall be subject to approval in accordance with
the provisions of  101.9 of the Board's Statements of Procedure. 

3. Section 102.42 is revised to read as follows: 



 102.42 

Filings of briefs and proposed findings with the administrative law judge and oral argument at the hearing. 



Any party shall be entitled, upon request, to a reasonable period at the close of the hearing for oral argument, which
may include presentation of proposed findings and conclusions, and shall be included in the stenographic report
of the hearing. In the discretion of the administrative law judge, any party may, upon request made before the close
of the hearing, file a brief or proposed findings and conclusions, or both, with the administrative law judge, who
may fix a reasonable time for such filing, but not in excess of 35 days from the close of the hearing. Requests for further
extensions of time shall be made to the chief administrative law judge in Washington, D.C., to the deputy chief judge
in San Francisco, California, to the associate chief judge in New York, New York, or to the associate chief judge in
Atlanta, Georgia, as the case may be. Notice of the request for any extension shall be immediately served on all other
parties, and proof of service shall be furnished. Three copies of the brief or proposed findings and conclusions shall
be filed with the administrative law judge, and copies shall be served on the other parties, and a statement of such
service shall be furnished. In any case in which the administrative law judge believes that written briefs or proposed
findings of fact and conclusions may not be necessary, he or she shall notify the parties at the opening of the hearing
or as soon thereafter as practicable that he or she may wish to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs. 

4.  102.45, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows: 



 102.45 

Administrative law judge's decision; contents; service; transfer of case to the Board; contents of record in case.




(a) After hearing for the purpose of taking evidence upon a complaint, the administrative law judge shall prepare
a decision. Such decision shall contain findings of fact, conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, upon all
material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record, and shall contain recommendations as to what
disposition of the case should be made, which may include, if it be found that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging
in the alleged unfair labor practices, a recommendation for such affirmative action by the respondent as will effectuate
the policies of the Act. The administrative law judge shall file the original of his decision with the Board and cause
a copy thereof to be served on each of the parties. If the administrative law judge delivers a bench decision, promptly
upon receiving the transcript the judge shall certify the accuracy of the pages of the transcript containing the decision;
file with the Board a certified copy of those pages, together with any supplementary matter the judge may deem necessary
to complete the decision; and cause a copy thereof to be served on each of the parties. Upon the filing of the decision,
the Board shall enter an order transferring the case to the Board and shall serve copies of the order, setting forth
the date of such transfer, on all the parties. Service of the administrative law judge's decision and of the order transferring
the case to the Board shall be complete upon mailing.

Dissenting Opinion of Members Stephens and Cohen 



1. Introduction 



We are not opposed to the provision regarding settlement judges. We have some concerns that the provision may tempt
respondents to delay settlement talks with the Regional Offices and thereby upset the highly successful settlement
efforts of those offices. However, we are willing, in light of the one-year sunset provision, to join our colleagues
in promulgating this provision. 

We are strongly opposed, however, to the rules that give Administrative Law Judges (ALJs or Judges) the discretion
to dispense with briefs and to issue bench decisions. 



2. Statutory Issue 



As a threshold matter, we note that, under established Board law, the provision for bench decisions directly contravenes
the Act. In 

Plastic Film Products Corp., 

232 NLRB 722 (1977), the Board held that such decisions fail to comply not only with Section 102.45 of the Board's Rules
and Regulations, 

but also with Section 10(c) of the Act. Id. 

at 722. See also 

Local Union No. 195 (Stone & Webster Engineering Corp.), 

237 NLRB 931 (1978) (oral grant of motion for summary dismissal of complaint at close of hearing violates Section 10(c)
as well as Section 102.45 of Board's Rules and Regulations).
 Thus, the Board's new rule reverses established Board law.

In arguing to the contrary, our colleagues rely upon 

Jumbo Produce, 

294 NLRB 998. However, that case is readily distinguishable. In that case, the judge made an oral evidentiary ruling
on a single issue. He did not rule on the entire case. Indeed, the Board specifically noted this in distinguishing its
earlier ruling in 

Local Union 195. 

See 294 NLRB at 999 n.4. We have no quarrel with the traditional practice under which judges issue bench rulings on evidentiary
issues. But the instant rule goes far beyond that. It gives the judge the power to orally decide the entire case.

We recognize that, in 

Local Union 195, 

the judge did not read any findings and conclusions into the record. However, in 

Plastic Film Products, 

the judge did precisely that. Notwithstanding this, the Board found that the judge's decision violated Section 10(c)
of the Act.








In sum, the rules are at odds with Board law. Our colleagues, in apparent recognition of this fact, overrule Board law
to the extent necessary to accomplish their purpose. However, they set forth no rationale for this result other than
the assertion that the cases are based on a ``misreading'' of Section 10(c). They offer no support for this sweeping
assertion. Further, they may not have the power to overrule the extant cases. If the Board was correct in the prior cases,
i.e., if Congress did indeed intend to preclude bench decisions in enacting Section 10(c), then the Board is simply
without authority to establish a rule to the contrary. See 

Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 

467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984) (where intent of Congress is clear, agency must give effect to that intent).

Although the Board has now declared that it has the power to issue the rule, that declaration will not end the matter.
The statutory issue will undoubtedly be the subject of extended litigation in the federal courts. Thus, for this reason
as well as other reasons described 

infra, 

the rule is at cross-purposes with its stated goal: to expedite the final resolution of unfair labor practice cases.



3. Policy Considerations



We do not rest entirely, or even principally, on the statutory issue. Quite apart from the statutory issue, we oppose,
for policy reasons, the provisions giving ALJs the power to issue bench decisions and the related power to dispense
with written briefs. In our view, the rules sacrifice fundamental fairness, procedural due process and high-quality
decisionmaking. This sacrifice is said to be in the interest of speed. However, we are not convinced that the rules
will result in any overall savings of time. More importantly, to the extent that they might save some time, the price
is simply too high.

We first address the rule concerning briefs. Underlying much of our concern about this rule is one critical fact: NLRB
proceedings are conducted without pre-trial discovery. Thus, far from involving a rehash of previous deposition
testimony and jousting over the significance of documents long ago made available to the opposing side, Board trials
typically represent the first occasion on which the parties learn the details of their opponent's case.
 Notwithstanding this fact, the rule would require counsel, promptly upon the close of evidence, to marshal the pertinent
facts, spot all the factual and legal issues, cite the relevant authority, and articulate policy concerns_all in
a cogent and organized fashion. In our view, even the ablest of counsel cannot be expected to do an effective job under
these circumstances. Moreover, as some of the comments on the proposed rules have pointed out,
 counsel for respondents will be at a distinct disadvantage under this scheme. Armed with the information gathered
in the pre-complaint investigation, the General Counsel is in a much better position than respondent's counsel to
plot out in advance an oral presentation of the facts and the law.






The rule is otherwise flawed. Although it provides for a ``reasonable period'' for oral argument, it does not provide
such a period for the 

preparation 

of the argument. Further, even if a judge granted such a period, that would not cure the fundamental defect in this provision.
A recess period is simply no substitute for the time-honored practice of reading the transcript, researching the
issues by use of a library and computer technology, reflecting upon the law and the facts, and writing a cogent, organized
and persuasive brief.

Requiring counsel to throw together a presentation at the close of the trial also creates a real danger that relevant
points will be overlooked. The consequences of any such omission or oversight can be severe. If a party fails to raise
a point before the ALJ, it may well have waived its right to raise that issue before the Board. See, e.g., 

Local 520, IUOE (Mautz & Oren, Inc.)

, 298 NLRB 1098, 1098 n.3 (1990); 

Hydro Logistics, Inc., 

287 NLRB 602, n.1 (1987). Issues not raised before the Board, of course, cannot ordinarily be raised on appeal. See
NLRB Section 10(e).

For all of the reasons discussed above, we believe that dispensing with briefs is fundamentally unfair to the participants
in Board proceedings. We further believe that this practice will erode the quality of decision-making by ALJs. As
any decision-maker can attest, the decisional process is greatly facilitated by access to thorough and competent
written arguments on both sides of the issue. Substituting hasty and perhaps ill-considered oral presentations
for written briefs cannot help but make the job of the ALJ more difficult, as well as that of the Board members and federal
judges who must review the ALJ's decision.

The provision allowing ALJs to issue decisions from the bench is perhaps even more objectionable. First of all, the
threat to the quality of ALJ decisions posed by dispensing with briefing will only be compounded by the absence of a
written ALJ decision. In essence, the Judge will have just heard oral arguments, which were constructed without benefit
of time for assimilation, research, organization and reflection. The judge will thereupon render a decision, without
an independent opportunity for assimilation, research, organization and reflection. In our view, such a process
is not a recipe for excellence_or even quality_in decision-making.

The use of bench decisions, moreover, is bound to compound the Board's difficulties in the federal courts. In recent
years, reviewing courts have shown an increasing propensity to remand cases to the Board (or simply to reverse the
Board outright) on grounds that the Board has not adequately articulated the basis for its decision. Our colleagues
nonetheless wish to implement a rule that can only exacerbate this problem.

As the new rule recognizes, ALJ bench decisions are not exempt from the requirements of the Administrative Procedures
Act (APA), which provides that all decisions ``shall include a statement of * * * findings and conclusions,
and the reasons or basis therefore, 

on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record * * *.''

 5 U.S.C. Section 557(c) (1988) (emphasis added). Just as the most competent of counsel will have difficulty constructing
a cogent oral argument on the spot, so, too will even the ablest of ALJs have difficulty covering all the basis required
by the APA in a bench decision_especially one rendered without the benefit of written briefs. The question whether
the Judge's oral decision complies with the APA will thus, as noted in comments on the proposed rule,
 provide fertile ground for litigation before the circuit courts as well as the Board.





In addition, we are not convinced that resorting to bench decisions will result in any net savings of time_the driving
force behind this provision. Litigation over the adequacy of the Judge's oral findings is almost certain to add time
at both the Board and court levels. Indeed, the mere opportunity to litigate this procedural issue may result in the
appeal of cases that would not otherwise be taken up_for instance, Section 8(a)(3) cases that turn largely on the Judge's
factual findings. Moreover, where the Judge has indeed failed to make all the proper findings, the Board will have
to attempt, where possible, to supply the missing ingredients itself, or else remand the case for further findings_both
time-consuming processes. Further remands will be doubt occur at the circuit court level when the court disagrees
with the Board's determination regarding the adequacy of the findings.

Thus, litigation over the ``adequacy'' issue, and the necessity for remands in some cases, will add time to the process.
In our view, this additional time will likely be greater than the time saved by dispensing with a written decision.
 Whereas a remand will likely result in a minimum of several months of delay, requiring a written decision (after the
filing of briefs) should add at most several weeks to the decision time in a ``simple'' case_a period that can be kept
to a minimum by encouraging ALJs to set short briefing schedules in appropriate cases.





In this regard, we do not share our colleagues' apparent belief that remands can be avoided by carefully culling out
only relatively simple cases. The rule, of course, does not confine use of the procedure to any particular kind of case.
Even if ALJs attempt to abide by the ``suggestions'' put forth by the Board, there will undoubtedly be cases where the
prediction is not borne out. A case that appears ``simple'' may turn out not to be so simple after all. This is particularly
true, given the absence of discovery. The fact that the ALJ knows little about the case until the evidence unfolds at
trial increases the risk that a case that appears at first blush to require only a straightforward credibility determination
or the application of a well-settled principle of law may, upon reflection, turn out to involve much more.

4. The Comments




The concerns set forth above are shared by most of the persons and organizations submitting comments. The great bulk
of the comments submitted to the Board express strong opposition both to dispensing with briefs and to oral ALJ decisions.
 Indeed, the proposed rules are characterized in such terms as ``ill-advised'', ``unwarranted'', and as ``sacrific[ing]
accuracy, fairness and quality for expedience.''
 The sole comment that fully supports the proposed rule completely ignores one of our primary sources of concern (discussed
extensively in our earlier statement as well as in our dissent today)_the lack of discovery in Board proceedings.
The comment is thus unpersuasive.









5. Conclusion




Like our colleagues, we are in favor of expediting the Board's processes. The rules being implemented today, however,
are unlikely to achieve that end, and in any event would do so at a cost that is much too high to pay. That price includes:
a lack of fundamental fairness in Board proceedings, a decline in the quality of the agency's decisional product,
and increasing tension in our relationship with the federal courts.


In our quest for speed, we must be careful not to undermine the fundamental goals of fairness in our decisional procedure
and excellence in our decisional product. Because we believe that the rules approved by our colleagues will do just
that, we dissent.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains three corrections to the amendments to the hazard communication final rule, which were published
February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6126).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background


Amendments to OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) were published on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6126). The modified
final rule included a number of minor changes and technical amendments to further clarify the requirements of the
HCS published August 24, 1987 (52 FR 31852). The amendments included a new exemption to the standard's requirements.
Section (b)(6)(ii) intended to exempt any hazardous substance as such term is defined by the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 

et seq.

), only when subject to comprehensive regulations issued under the Act by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


Need for Correction


The language of the CERCLA exemption was patterned after the language of the Resources Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA) exemption that precedes it. However, this has led to possible misinterpretation because CERCLA, unlike
RCRA, regulates many chemicals in the limited circumstances of remedial and removal actions and does not pervasively
regulate those chemicals. It was OSHA's intent to exempt CERCLA-listed chemicals only in circumstances where they
are fully regulated by EPA, making OSHA's HCS requirements duplicative.
Consequently, OSHA is correcting the language to make this clear. The new language states that the exemption applies
to any hazardous substance as that term is defined by CERCLA when the hazardous substance is the focus of remedial or
removal action being conducted under CERCLA in accordance with EPA regulations.
This document also corrects a typographical error in section (c) of the standard and eliminates a confusing clause.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Park Service (NPS), in accordance with 
16 U.S.C. 460

l

-22, by this rule restricts the creation of 
new solid waste disposal sites in units of the National Park System 
and controls the operations of such sites, in existence as of 
September 1, 1984, so as to minimize adverse effects to the 
environment and visitor enjoyment in units of the National Park 
System.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 



In 1984, the Congress enacted legislation, Pub. L. 98-506 
(98 Stat. 2338) codified at 16 U.S.C. 460

l

-22(c) (the Act), to 
prohibit the operation of ``solid waste disposal sites'' within units 
of the National Park System except for those ``operating as of 
September 1, 1984,'' or those ``used only for disposal of wastes 
generated within that unit so long as such site will not degrade 
any of the natural or cultural resources'' of the unit. The Act 
went on to direct the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate 
regulations to ``carry out the provisions of this subsection, 
including reasonable regulations to mitigate the adverse effects of 
solid waste disposal sites in operation as of September 1, 1984, 
upon the property of the United States.'' The regulations 
implement those statutory provisions. Further authority for 
the restriction and controls on operations of existing solid 
waste disposal sites is found in the Act of August 16, 1916, as 
amended, (NPS Organic Act) codified at 16 U.S.C. 1 and 3. 



Summary of Comments 



These rules were published in proposed form for public comment on 
December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65141-65149) with a comment period of 
60 calendar days. The comment period closed at the end of 
business, February 11, 1994. The National Park Service received 
seven timely comments regarding the proposed regulations. 
Because Federal offices in Washington, DC were closed on February 
11, 1994 due to a snow emergency, and the NPS could not accept 
comments on that day, the NPS accepted comments received on 
Monday, February 14, 1994. Comments were received from two 
States, two individuals, one organization, and two offices within 
the National Park Service. Of the seven comments, three were 
either fully supportive of the rule or advocated further 
restrictions. The other four comments questioned both the 
scope and the meaning of the rule. 



Analysis of Comments 



Section 6.2 Applicability and Scope 



The regulations are generally applicable to any solid 
waste disposal site operated in, or proposed for operation in, 
units of the National Park System. Two comments sought 
clarification of this rule and how it coincides with State 
regulations. The States, under the overall aegis of the 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are the primary 
regulatory authorities for solid waste disposal sites on all 
lands within the boundaries of National Park System units, 
including Federal lands (See Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act at 42 U.S.C. 6961). This rule does not duplicate existing 
State regulatory controls for solid waste disposal sites in units 
of the National Park System. Rather, this rule governs the 
conditions under which a solid waste disposal site may exist within 
the boundaries of a National Park System unit, not whether the 
site meets the standards of EPA and State regulations. 

The National Park Service does not intend to displace the States by administering the standards of 40 CFR parts 257
and 258, Solid 
Waste Disposal Facility Criteria, to sites within the boundaries of 
National Park System units. 

One comment asked what action the National Park Service would take 
should the appropriate unit of State or local government fail to 
apply the standards at 40 CFR parts 257 and 258 to a solid waste disposal 
site within a National Park System unit. In such cases, the NPS 
Regional Director for the unit involved would notify the EPA and 
the appropriate States to secure enforcement of regulations by the 
proper entity. Where an operator of a solid waste disposal site 
is governed by a National Park Service permit under 36 CFR 6.4, 
6.5, or 6.6 of this part, the Regional Director may, among other 
things, revoke a permit to operate under  6.12 of this part for 
operator failure to comply with EPA or State regulations governing 
solid waste disposal. Language has been added to  6.12 of the 
final rule to include noncompliance with State regulations or 
standards at 40 CFR parts 257 and 258 as a basis for which permit 
revocation, forfeiture of bond, or penalties may be applied. 

One comment requested that the rule also apply to solid waste 
disposal sites adjacent to units of the National Park System. 
In the context of Pub. L. 98-506, the Service concludes that the 
regulation of existing sites and the prohibition of new sites apply 
only to lands and waters within the boundaries of a National Park 
System unit. Therefore, the final rule does not extend its reach 
beyond unit boundaries.

Three comments questioned whether the rule applies to nonfederal 
lands within the boundaries of National Park System units. 
The final rule, as does the proposed, applies to all nonfederal 
lands within such boundaries, without regard to title. 
Congress explicitly directed that the law apply ``* * * within the 
boundary of any unit of the National Park System.'' It is not 
within the authority of the National Park Service to rewrite an act 
of Congress and limit the rule's applicability to only ``Federal 
lands within the boundary.'' 

There are many statutes establishing National Park System units. A brief survey of these statutes disclosed that
the phrase 
``within the boundaries'' is commonly employed to refer to both 
Federal land and nonfederally owned land or interests in land 
within the outer boundaries a unit. The statute, Pub. L. 98-506, 
that mandates this final rule specifically uses the term ``

within 
the boundary 

of any unit of the National Park System.'' (Emphasis 
added) 

One comment from Alaska noted that 36 CFR 1.2 applies only 
certain regulations to nonfederal lands, and then, only in 
those units under the concurrent or exclusive legislative 
jurisdiction of the United States. However, the self-imposed 
limitation of 36 CFR 1.2(b) applies only to regulations at 36 
CFR parts 1 through 5 and 7. Because Congress specifically 
enacted a statute, Pub. L. 98-506, that applies to all lands within 
the boundaries of a unit, the regulations derived from that statute are not limited by 36 CFR 1.2(b). 

The situation most analogous to 36 CFR part 6 is 36 CFR part 9, 
subpart A, Mining and Mining Claims. The regulations at 36 CFR part 9A apply to all mining claims within a unit, both
patented and 
unpatented, and in all parks, even in those where the United 
States exercises neither concurrent nor exclusive legislative 
jurisdiction. Thus, for example, patented claims, which are 
private property in every sense of the word, in Death Valley 
National Monument, or the Kantishna area of Denali National Park 
and Preserve (areas of proprietary jurisdiction only) are 
governed by 36 CFR part 9 subpart A, notwithstanding 36 CFR 
1.2(b). The same principle applies to 36 CFR part 6. 

Three comments questioned whether the regulations apply to 
nonfederal lands within unit boundaries in units of the National 
Park System specifically in Alaska. (Alaska units of the National 
Park System contain approximately 2.7 million nonfederal acres of 
a total of over 54 million acres encompassed within their 
boundaries, or approximately 5% of the total acreage.) 

The basis for the comments from Alaska lies in section 103(c) 
of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) 
(16 U.S.C. 3103(c)). That language states:



 

Only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation 
system unit which are public lands (as such term is defined 
in this Act) shall be deemed to be included as a portion 
of such unit. No lands which, before, on, or after the date of enactment of this act, are conveyed to the State, 
to any Native Corporation, or any private party shall be 
subject to the regulations applicable 

solely

 to public lands within such units. If the State, a Native 
Corporation, or other owner desires to convey any such lands, the Secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with
applicable law (including this Act), and any such lands shall 

become part of the unit,

 and be administered accordingly. (Emphasis added)

 


The comments from Alaska cite this language to raise the 
significant issue of whether nonfederal lands within National Park System units in Alaska are part of the units at
all, and 
thus subject to any NPS regulations, including the final rule at 36 
CFR part 6. 



Section 103(c) language creates a question of statutory 
interpretation. Namely, does this section effectively render the 
solid waste site law (Pub. L. 98-506), and its implementing 
regulations, inapplicable to all nonfederal lands in National Park 
System units in Alaska? Or does it simply mean that the non-federal lands are not be to be administered as part of the

conservation unit in the same manner as the Federal lands? 
It is the Service's opinion that the language of section 103(c) 
does not render the final rule at 36 CFR part 6 inapplicable to 
nonfederal lands in units of the National Park System in Alaska 
because of the presence of the word ``solely.'' Since Pub. L. 98-506 
authorizes the regulation of solid waste disposal sites, and 
prohibits all but certain such sites, ``within the boundary of any 
unit of the National Park System,'' neither the law, nor its 
regulations apply ``solely'' to public lands within the units. 

The other possibility is that section 103(c) renders Pub. L. 
98-506 inapplicable by its own terms. Pub. L. 98-506 applies 
``within the boundary of any unit of the National Park System.'' 
The first sentence of section 103(c) specifies:





Only those lands within the boundaries of any 
conservation system units which are public lands 
(as such term is defined in this Act) shall be 
deemed to be included as a 

portion of such unit

. 
(Emphasis added)


 

Under this argument, since nonfederal lands are not ``a portion 
of'' a unit, they are not ``within the boundary of a National Park 
System unit'' and thus not subject to this regulation. The Service 
believes that the better view of the law negates this argument. 



Pub. L. 98-506 applies ``within the boundary of any unit of the 
National Park System.'' Words in a statute generally are to be 
given their common meaning. The common understanding of the words 
``within the boundary'' is that something be within the outer limits. 
It does not mean the same thing as ``a portion of.'' Perhaps the 
best indication of this analysis is the use of the word ``within'' in 
the Alaska Lands Act itself. Section 1301(b)(7) (16 U.S.C. 
3191(b)), refers to ``privately owned areas, if any, which are 


within such unit

.'' Thus, while there are no privately-owned areas 
which are ``a portion of'' the unit, the Alaska Lands Act recognizes 
that there are privately-owned areas ``within'' a unit. 

Section 103(c) itself speaks of ``only those lands within the 
boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public 
lands,'' thus implying the existence of non-public lands within 
those boundaries. The Service therefore concludes from the 
language of section 103(c) itself that nonfederal lands are ``within'' the boundaries of Alaska units of the National
Park System 
even if they are not ``a portion of'' the unit. 

The comments from Alaska offer an opportunity to further clarify 
the applicability of 36 CFR part 6 and illuminate the exceptions to 
this rule that are specifically aimed at small private 
residential inholders. Persons who either reside or farm within 
the exterior boundaries of a National Park System unit need not 
submit a request and obtain a permit from the Regional Director 
for the disposal of residential or agricultural wastes on their 
lands. 

The proposed rule at  6.2(c)(iii) stated that such waste could be 
disposed of ``on lands or waters'' that ``he or she owns or leases'' 
within the unit. In response to two comments, the final rule 
deletes the word ``waters'' since disposing of solid waste in water 
or wetlands may likely violate other laws. In the interest of 
gender neutrality, the word ``person'' is substituted for ``he or 
she.''

One comment noted that  6.2(d) exempts the NPS from its own rules 
at this part. Two comments asked how the NPS will ensure 
compliance with conditions of  6.4 for NPS-operated solid waste 
disposal sites, if the procedural, administrative, financial 
assurance and penalty provisions of the proposed regulations do 
not apply to NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. The NPS 
will adhere to the conditions of  6.4 (for a new, or 
expanded existing solid waste disposal site) and to the conditions 
of  6.5 (for existing NPS operated solid waste disposal 
sites) as a matter of policy and special directive. In addition, 
the NPS will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act 
(42 U.S.C. 4321, 

et seq.

) and, at a minimum, prepare an 
environmental assessment for any new, or expansion of any 
existing, solid waste disposal site that the NPS proposes. 
The final rule changes the word ``procedural'' at  6.2(d) to 
``permit'' for clarity. The reason why the permit, bond and 
penalty provisions do not apply to the NPS is that there is no 
means by which the NPS may be both the permitting agency and the 
permittee, the bond-poster and the bond-holder, the enforcer and 
the violator, simultaneously. 


Section 6.3 Definitions 


In response to one comment, note that the proposed, as well as the 
final, definition of the term ``agricultural waste'' includes waste 
resulting from the ``harvesting of . . . trees.'' 
One comment specifically sought clarification about whether 
concession operations in parks, whether under contracts or 
commercial use licenses are ``exempt'' from the regulations. 
This question is best answered by discussing the definition 
of the term ``National Park Service activities.'' There must be a 
necessary connection between the NPS and the establishment of a 
solid waste disposal site after the passage of the Act. ``National 
Park Service activities'' includes activities conducted by NPS 
contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees because such persons, under agreement with the NPS,
provide eating, 
lodging, transportation and other services to park visitors or to 
park management itself. Since the NPS may operate a new solid 
waste disposal site within a unit for NPS activities, the NPS may 
approve new sites for the disposal of solid waste generated by NPS 
contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees. Such 
persons may also dispose of solid waste in existing NPS operated or 
approved sites. 
While NPS contractors, concessionaires and commercial use 
licensees may dispose of solid waste on lands within a unit, any 
proposal by such a person to establish their own new site for solid 
waste disposal, or continue to operate and use their own existing 
solid waste disposal site, is fully governed by 36 CFR 6.4 or 6.5 
respectively. 
The disposal of solid waste by such persons, while permissible on 
lands within a National Park System unit, must be subject to full 
NPS scrutiny. The NPS has a fundamental obligation to ensure that 
contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees dispose 
of solid waste on lands within a unit, even the remote lands in 
Alaska, in an environmentally sensitive manner. 
``Residential waste,'' as defined in  6.3, means waste generated by 
the normal activities of a household. One comment suggested that 
the residential waste exception at  6.2(c) not include paper, 
plastic and metal. Since the  6.2(c) exception is intended to 
minimize the solid waste stream by providing an alternative 
disposal means for agricultural or residential solid wastes that 
are compostible, we have partially adopted the suggestion. The 
final rule defines ``residential waste'' to exclude plastic and metal 
waste, since these are not compostible. 
One comment appeared to confuse the ``residential waste'' exception 
of this part with the ``household waste exclusion'' that exists 
under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations 
at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1). The definition of ``residential solid 
waste'' used in this part comes from 40 CFR part 243. That 
definition means waste generated by the normal activities of 
households. This definition applies only to residences, not to 
commercial activities, such as lodges, motels or eating 
establishments. On the other hand, the EPA definition at 40 CFR 
261.4(b)(1) broadly excludes ``household waste'' from the legal 
meaning of hazardous waste. The 40 CFR part 261 meaning of 
``household waste'' includes waste generated by residences AND 
commercial lodging and eating establishments. It does not follow 
that because 36 CFR part 6 largely excludes residential waste from 
its control, that the NPS is also somehow excluding waste disposal 
from commercial lodging or eating establishments. The fact that 
wastes generated by such establishments are specifically excluded 
from the definition of ``hazardous waste'' under RCRA regulations 
does not make such wastes ``residential wastes'' for the purposes of 
this regulation. These two issues are unrelated and are addressed 
in separate sections of this regulation.

One comment suggested that the proposed definition of ``solid 
waste disposal site'' is so broad that it would encompass lands 
where the Exxon Valdez spilled oil. The Service agrees, and 
inserts language in the final definition of ``solid waste disposal 
site'' to make clear that 36 CFR part 6 does not govern discharges 
of materials, or substances into the environment that are covered 
by such laws as the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(3)) and the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation and 
Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601 

et seq.

). It was never the intent of 
the NPS to regulate such discharges or deposits as if they were 
``solid waste disposal sites.'' 




One comment suggested that this rule also govern ``transfer 
stations,'' since they are places where solid waste is deposited, 
albeit temporarily. Because such stations may be places of 
significant degradation to park resources resulting from noise, 
litter, visual intrusion, runoff and traffic, the Service has 
decided to include transfer stations in the definition of a ``solid 
waste disposal site.'' 



Section 6.4 Solid Waste Disposal Sites Not in Operation 
on September 1, 1984 





Note that the EPA's definition of ``hazardous waste'' at 40 CFR part 
261 excludes wastes generated by households (including single and 
multiple family residences, hotels and motels). In light of one 
comment, the Service reiterates that such waste is not ``legally'' 
hazardous. This ``household waste exclusion'' is mentioned here again because it is important to point out that the
prohibition at 
 6.4(a)(6)(i) and at  6.5(c)(3)(i) does not prevent the NPS from 
accepting for disposal at NPS-operated solid waste disposal sites, 
solid wastes such as used oil, grease, paints, solvents, cleaning 
agents, or pesticides that are generated by ``households.'' Such 
materials are not ``legally'' hazardous waste when discarded by 
households (including hotels, motels, restaurants, single or 
multiple family residences). 




Thus, as long as such waste is generated by National Park Service 
activities, such as garbage collection from park/concessionaire 
employees, they may be disposed of in an NPS-operated solid waste 
disposal site. 



Section 6.5 Solid Waste Disposal Sites in Operation on 
September 1, 1984 





In response to comments from the NPS Alaska Region, the Service 
points out that both the proposed and the final rule recognize 
that some communities may lie wholly within the boundaries of a 
unit of the National Park System in Alaska. Such communities may 
exhaust the capacity of their existing solid waste disposal 
site. Such communities may request that the Regional Director 
permit them to expand an existing site within the unit. The 
Regional Director must normally judge such a request under the 
conditions in  6.4. However, the Regional Director will instead 
judge a request for expansion of an existing site under the 
approval conditions of  6.5(c), if the operator shows that the solid waste is generated solely from within the
boundaries of the 
unit, the operator owns or leases the lands proposed for the 
expansion, and the solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail or 
adequate water access to any lands outside of the unit for all, or 
substantial, portions of the year. 



Section 6.6 Solid Waste Disposal Sites Within New Additions 
to the National Park System





One comment indicates that this section applies to units 
of the National Park System created in Alaska in 1980. Although 
the regulation plainly states it, the Service repeats that this 
section applies only to lands and waters that fall within the 
boundaries of a unit of the National Park System as a result 
of unit establishment or expansion after the effective date of 
the regulations as final. 



Section 6.7 Mining Wastes 





One comment asked how this part applies to operations on mining 
claims. This section is intended to clarify the relationship 
between the final regulations governing solid waste disposal and 
existing regulations at 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, that 
govern mineral operations. Without this section, this final 
regulation would govern solid waste disposal sites by all 
mineral operators. The NPS now regulates solid waste disposal 
by many mineral operators and does not intend to create a 
duplicate regulatory scheme for such operators. Thus, this 
section excludes from the permit and financial assurance provisions of the final regulations solid waste disposal
sites 
by operators that are, now or prospectively, governed by NPS 
regulations at 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral 
lease. 



Section 6.8 National Park Service Solid Waste Responsibilities 





One comment asked if the NPS would establish a household 
``harmful'' waste collection program for its inholders. The 
answer is ``No.'' Inholders may not dispose of their waste in NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. Nor is the NPS
in the 
business of collecting waste from inholders. Moreover, the NPS 
will establish collection programs for household waste that, 
though not legally hazardous, may be harmful, ONLY in those units 
where the NPS operates a solid waste disposal site. 




The same comment then seemed to suggest that since the 
regulations at 36 CFR 6.8(b) mandate the establishment of 
collection programs for ``household hazardous wastes'' ONLY for parks 
that operate solid waste disposal sites, then only such parks 
need have hazardous waste collection programs. This is 
incorrect. Every park that generates waste that is defined by 40 
CFR part 261 as hazardous, must collect, store, handle and manage 
that waste under the regulations governing such waste prescribed 
under Subtitle D of RCRA. To eliminate confusion, the final rule 
at  6.8(b) no longer refers to ``household hazardous waste'' which 
legally is not ``hazardous'' but to ``harmful wastes generated 
by residential activities.''

One comment asked why the requirements of  6.8(c) apply only to ``carbonated beverages in containers'' as opposed
to all beverage containers. The rule does not propose to go beyond 40 CFR part 244. Regulations at 40 CFR part 244 require
deposit systems only for containers holding ``carbonated beverages.''



Section 6.12 Prohibited Acts and Penalties



One comment asked if this section applies the penalties to solid waste disposal sites on ``private inholdings.''
The answer is yes, 36 CFR part 6, including its penalty provisions, applies to solid waste disposal sites on nonfederal
lands, insofar as such lands are within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System.



Section-by-Section Analysis


Section 6.2 Applicability and Scope


The regulations are generally applicable to any solid waste disposal site operated in, or proposed for operation
in, units of the National Park System. While the NPS is concerned with the disposal of all solid wastes on all lands and
waters within unit boundaries, the rule provides for certain exceptions. This final rule at  6.2(c) does not
require that all persons who either reside or farm within the exterior boundaries of a National Park System unit submit
a request and obtain a permit from the Regional Director for the disposal of residential or agricultural wastes on
their lands. Paragraph (c) provides that a person residing within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System
may dispose of certain solid wastes without a permit or penalty unless the person requires a State or local permit or
license to dispose of solid waste. The final rule enumerates conditions under which such persons may dispose of waste.
This exemption does not apply to the disposal of agricultural pesticides, pesticide equipment or containers.

This exception is intended to minimize the solid waste stream by providing an alternative disposal means for agricultural
or residential solid wastes that are compostible.

If the Superintendent of the affected unit determines that the disposal of agricultural or residential solid wastes
poses a reasonable probability of threat to public health or the environment, as described in the regulations at 40
CFR part 257, the Superintendent will notify the Regional Director and the resident that the request, permit, and
penalty provisions of 36 CFR part 6 are applicable.

Paragraph 6.2(d) explains the effect of the regulations on NPS operated sites. Existing and new solid waste disposal
sites operated or proposed by the NPS for administration of the National Park System must meet the standards prescribed
in 40 CFR subchapter I, specifically at 40 CFR part 241, Guidelines for the Land Disposal of Solid Waste; part 257, Criteria
for Classification of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities and Practices, and part 258 Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste
Landfills, and by appropriate State laws. The permit, administrative, financial assurance and penalty provisions
of the final rule do not apply to NPS operated landfills. However, the NPS will adhere to the conditions of  6.4
to establish a new, or expand an existing, solid waste disposal site for NPS activities. The NPS will also adhere to
the conditions of  6.5 to continue operations at existing NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. In addition,
the NPS will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321, 

et seq.

) and, at a minimum, prepare an environmental assessment for any new, or expansion of any existing, solid waste disposal
site that the NPS proposes.



Section 6.3 Definitions



The definitions section of the rule applies to terms that are not otherwise defined in 36 CFR part 1. The words defined
in the rule either come from the legislation on which the rule is based or are included to enhance the clarity and accuracy
of the rule. The primary purposes of the definitions are to make clear the reach and applicability of the rule for the
NPS and the regulated community and to ensure that actions taken under the rule are consistent and predictable. In
most cases, other statutes serve as the bases for the precise wording selected. These statutes are referred to in the
discussions of the definitions.

The term ``boundaries'' of any unit of the National Park System comes from the language of the statute. It is defined
in the final rule to include all lands within units of the National Park System, regardless of jurisdictional status
or ownership. Many units of the National Park System include nonfederal lands. Solid waste disposal on both Federal
and nonfederal lands within National Park System unit boundaries come under the purview of this rule.

Because there are no limitations on applicability to any class or type of lands in the statutory language, the rule
defines the term broadly. The definition includes waters as well as lands because of the breadth of the statutory language
and because the effects of such solid waste disposal sites are not limited to lands, but can also affect waters, particularly
groundwater.

The final rule adds a definition for the term ``compostible materials.'' The Service determines that facilities
for the management of compostible materials are not solid waste disposal sites for the purpose of these regulations.

Also defined is the term, ``National Park Service activities.'' It is explained for two reasons: First, to clarify
that there must be a necessary connection between the NPS and the establishment of solid waste disposal sites after
the passage of the Act; second, beginning one year after the effective date of the regulations, only persons engaged
in ``National Park Service activities,'' as defined herein, may dispose of solid waste in an NPS operated solid waste
disposal site. ``National Park Service activities'' thus includes activities conducted by NPS contractors, concessionaires
and commercial use licensees. Such persons, under agreement with the NPS, provide eating, lodging, transportation
and other services to park visitors. Since new solid waste disposal sites may be established in National Park System
units for NPS activities only, new sites may accept for disposal waste generated only by these persons. NPS contractors,
concessionaires, and commercial use licensees may also dispose of solid waste in existing NPS operated sites. ``National
Park Service activities'' do not include activities engaged in by Special Use Permittees (Form 10-114). Waste
disposal by Special Use Permittees and others is governed by all the substantive, permit, financial assurance and
penalty provisions of  6.4 for a new waste disposal site, or  6.5 for an existing site.

The word ``degrade'' also comes from the statute and is defined as ``to lessen in quantity, quality, or value.'' It
is included in the terms defined in the rule for the sake of clarity and predictability. Since the statutorily mandated
standard for any solid waste disposal site operating in a park unit is that the operation not ``degrade'' park resources,
this section provides guidance as to how the term degrade is to be used by the NPS in determining such effects.

The terms ``agricultural solid waste,'' ``residential solid waste'' and ``leachate,'' are defined as they are in
the regulations that govern solid waste under the authority of the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C.
6901 

et seq.

) and implemented at 40 CFR part 243, Guidelines for the Storage and Collection of Residential, Commercial, and Institutional
Solid Waste. The term ``hazardous waste'' refers to the definition of such solid waste prescribed at 40 CFR part 261,
Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes.

``Natural resources'' is defined here so as to provide a comprehensive inventory of the inherent attributes of National
Park System units that may be affected by solid waste disposal sites. The detailed listing of resource attributes
is designed to enable the agency and the regulated community sufficient consistency and specificity to evaluate
potential effects to the parks. The Report of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (House Report 98-1069)
that accompanied the Act said, ``the conditions of noise, air pollution, waste disposal in surrounding lands, rat
and other pest problems, and area disruption due to heavy truck use that are created by these waste disposal sites have
resulted in a deep concern over the degradation of park values.'' In another section, the Report stated ``The Committee
notes that the operation of solid waste disposal sites within units of the National Park System causes deterioration
of air and water quality, increases levels of mechanical noise, and has the potential to degrade land and water areas
that are in relatively natural condition and areas containing significant cultural values, and that the operation
of such disposal sites renders adjacent lands, and waters, unfit for full public use and enjoyment.'' In light of the
Committee's broad findings concerning what may constitute natural resources affected by solid waste disposal sites,
the drafters have chosen to provide a broad definition for this term.

The definition of the term ``National Park System,'' mirrors the statutory language of 16 U.S.C. 1c. The purpose in
including it here is that the term is used in the statute. Defining it in the rule clarifies the applicability of the
rule.

The definitions of the terms ``PCBs and PCB items'' and ``post closure care'' is the same as used by EPA. The terms ``PCBs
and PCB items'' are defined by regulations at 40 CFR part 761, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Manufacturing, Distribution
in Commerce, And Use Prohibitions. The terms ``closure'' and ``post closure care'' are described at 40 CFR part 258.

At the heart of this regulatory package are the management and control of ``solid waste.'' The National Park Service
defines the term similarly to that used in RCRA regulations at 40 CFR part 258. The broad definition of solid waste included
here is intended to ensure that all potential sources of adverse effects to National Park System units from such sources
come under the purview of the final rule. The rule also defines two classes of solid waste_
agricultural and residential_that may be exempt from the rule under clearly delineated circumstances.

Because the statute severely restricts the establishment of new ``(solid waste) disposal sites'' within units of
the National Park System and because the term is central to any regulatory activities under the framework of the statute,
it is defined in the rule. The definition is based on the statutory language in RCRA for the term ``disposal.'' The definition
explicitly states that such sites include land or waters where such solid waste may be placed.

The final rule governs solid waste transfer stations but not recycling centers, sewage treatment plants, septic
systems, or facilities for managing compostible materials.



Section 6.4 Solid Waste Disposal Sites Not in Operation on September 1, 1984



The regulation permits establishing new solid waste disposal sites after September 1, 1984, within units of the National
Park System, 

only

 with the approval of the Regional Director. This section does not apply to solid waste disposal sites in operation
on September 1, 1984.

The Regional Director may approve a permit for a new solid waste disposal site only under the stringent conditions
outlined in the rule that are derived from the statute. The Act states that any new sites must be ``* * *
used only for disposal of wastes generated within that unit of the park system * * *'' This is the basis
for the first approval condition. The drafters have included the phrase ``solely from National Park Service activities''
in recognition of the fact that the Congress acknowledged that the National Park Service might need to operate solid
waste disposal sites for its own management and associated activities. The Service believes that the statutory language
``wastes generated within that unit of the park system'' was meant to convey a nexus between the disposal sites and
activities of the NPS.

The second condition requires that there be no reasonable alternative for disposal outside the unit boundaries.

The third condition also is directly derived from the statute which says ``* * * so long as such site
will not degrade any of the natural and cultural resources of such park unit.'' The fourth and fifth conditions ensure
consistency and compliance with other Federal, State, and local regulatory programs. 
The sixth condition, that hazardous wastes may not be stored, handled, or disposed at solid waste disposal sites within
National Park System units, recognizes the unique resource values protected in the National Park System and the fundamental
incompatibility of the placement of hazardous wastes with protecting those resources. The final rule adds tires
to the list of wastes that may not be disposed of at a solid waste disposal site within the boundaries of a National Park
System unit. 
Note that the EPA's definition of hazardous waste at 40 CFR part 261 excludes wastes generated by households (including
single and multiple residences, hotels and motels). Thus, the sixth condition does not restrict disposal of household
wastes in NPS operated or other solid waste disposal sites in National Park System units, as long as the waste results
from National Park Service activities, such as garbage collection from park/concessionaire employees' residences.

The seventh condition, that such sites be located wholly on nonfederal lands, implements the policy of the National
Park Service articulated in its 

Management Policies

 (1988), page 9:6. As a consequence, no such sites may be established or expanded onto Federal lands in a unit, except
that the NPS may establish a new solid waste disposal site on Federal lands in a park where nonfederal lands do not exist,
or are otherwise unavailable or unsuitable. 
The eighth condition implements Executive Orders 11988 and 11990. The ninth and tenth conditions seek to clearly
specify precise categories of facilities and lands where solid waste disposal sites would be incompatible with NPS
management and visitor enjoyment. The eleventh condition limits the size of such sites and the twelfth condition
seeks to ensure that such sites will not degrade park resources and visitor enjoyment at a future date. 
The request for a permit forms the basis for the Regional Director's evaluation of whether the conditions for approval
listed above may be met. The Act states that its general purpose is to ``protect the air, land, water, natural and cultural
values of the National Park System and the property of the United States therein.'' Section 6.4(b) of the rule specifies
the minimum amount of information necessary, in the professional judgment of the NPS, to evaluate whether the air,
land, water, and cultural and natural resources of the National Park System can be protected if a proposed operation
is permitted. 
Finally,  6.4(c) requires that the Regional Director reject the request if the conditions for approval detailed
in paragraph (a) are not met. This section also requires that the Regional Director notify the requester of the rejection
and the reasons for the rejection. 


Section 6.5 Solid Waste Disposal Sites in Operation on September 1, 1984 


The NPS believes that solid waste disposal sites are not an appropriate use of lands within National Park System unit
boundaries. The long-term intent of the National Park Service is to eliminate, to the extent possible, such sites
from within unit boundaries. In the interim, the requirements of  6.5 are designed to ensure that any solid waste
disposal sites in operation on September 1, 1984, in units of the National Park System and continuously operated since
that time meet minimum standards for operation and do not degrade park resources and values. 
The term ``continuous operation'' requires clarification. The Service determines that a solid waste disposal site
existing on September 1, 1984, qualifies under  6.5, if that site has accepted solid waste for disposal at least
for some portion of each year after 1984. To be in ``continuous operation'' does not require that the site receive waste
on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. Often seasonal factors, such as weather, access, and fluctuations in waste
loads require that some existing sites may be used intermittently.

The approval conditions of  6.5 are designed to implement the 
section of the Act that requires the Secretary to promulgate 
regulations ``to mitigate the adverse effects of solid waste 
disposal sites in operation as of September 1, 1984, upon property 
of the United States.'' As a result of the statutory language, 
the first condition requires that there be adequate mitigation of 
adverse effects from the operation of the disposal site. The 
second condition requires compliance with all applicable Federal, 
State, and local laws and regulations. This section, like 
 6.4, requires that there be no hazardous waste disposal 
at any such sites because such activities are incompatible with 
the values and purpose of the National Park System and each unit 
thereof. 

Several solid waste disposal sites are currently operated by 
nonfederal parties in units of the National Park System. Most 
are on nonfederal lands within the unit boundaries, while others 
are on Federal lands within the units. The sites on Federal 
lands often exist because of agreements made as conditions to 
Federal acquisition of specific tracts of land. The regulations 
will not terminate any existing agreements that are in compliance 
with applicable local, State, and Federal laws. 

Section 6.5(c) prescribes the conditions under which the Regional Director may allow existing solid waste disposal
sites 
to continue operations. However, the NPS intends that existing 
solid waste disposal sites operated by nonfederal parties will 
not operate indefinitely. Under  6.5(e), a site that reaches its 
capacity may continue operation only if the site meets conditions 
applicable to new sites at  6.4(a). For the purposes of these 
regulations, the capacity of a solid waste disposal site is that 
area, volume, or height prescribed in the State-issued permit or 
other instrument. Any proposal to extend the capacity of an 
existing solid waste disposal site beyond that specified in the 
permit will be treated as a proposal for a new solid waste disposal 
site. Such a proposal is subject to the approval conditions in 
 6.4. 

It is conceivable that communities that lie wholly within the 
boundaries of a unit of the National Park System may exhaust the 
capacity of their existing solid waste disposal sites. Such 
communities may request that the Regional Director permit them to 
establish a new, or expand an existing, site within the unit. The 
Regional Director must judge such a request under the conditions 
prescribed in  6.4. However, the Regional Director will judge a 
request for expansion of an existing site under the approval 
conditions of  6.5(c), if the operator shows that: 

 The solid waste is generated solely from within the 
boundaries of the unit; and 

 The operator owns or leases the nonfederal lands proposed for the 
expansion; and 

 The solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail or adequate water 
access to any lands outside of the unit for all or substantial 
portions of the year. A substantial portion of the year consists 
of three or more consecutive months. 

The principles of this section govern the NPS. Should the 
NPS seek to expand an existing solid waste disposal site that has 
reached its capacity, such an expansion is to be judged as a ``new'' 
site, governed by the approval standards of  6.4(a). 

If the NPS meets the first and third conditions of  6.5(e)(2), the 
NPS may also expand an existing NPS-operated solid waste disposal 
site that has reached its capacity, under the standards of 
 6.5(c), rather than  6.4(a). 

The final rule includes a new section (f) to address concerns about 
solid waste incinerators and transfer stations. The proposed and 
final definition of ``solid waste disposal site'' included 
incinerators. The final rule defines solid waste disposal sites to 
also include transfer stations. The installation of an incinerator 
or a transfer station where there was no site for solid waste 
disposal on September 1, 1984 is governed by  6.4. Section 6.5(a) 
governs the continued operation of an incinerator or a transfer 
station where such a solid waste disposal site existed before 
September 1, 1984. Existing incinerators or transfer stations, 
just as any other solid waste disposal site, may continue to 
dispose of solid waste within the boundaries of a unit of the 
National Park System only after applying to the NPS under  6.5(a) 
and under the standards of  6.5(c). 

Because incinerators or transfer stations generally do not reach capacity and require expansion,  6.5(e)
does not apply to them. 
Rather  6.5(e) addresses conventional land-fill solid waste 
disposal sites. 

Section 6.5(f) is needed to address the conversion of an existing 
land-fill solid waste disposal site to a transfer station after the 
effective date of this rule. Without  6.5(f), an operator of an 
existing solid waste disposal site, approved under  6.5(c), may not 
realize that converting an existing solid waste disposal land-fill 
to a transfer station requires a request to the NPS Regional 
Director and further NPS review and approval. 



Section 6.6 Solid Waste Disposal Sites Within New Additions 
to the National Park System



This section is included in the final rule in recognition of the 
fact that solid waste disposal sites, either on Federal or 
nonfederal lands, may be added to the National Park System through 
addition of new units or the expansion of existing units. 


Management Policies

 state that solid waste disposal sites are not 
compatible with the purpose of the National Park System and the 
intent of Congress was to eliminate solid waste disposal sites from 
the National Park System in the future. 

Thus, solid waste disposal sites on Federal or nonfederal 
lands included within a unit boundaries must cease operations 
immediately upon expiration of the permit or license in effect on 
the date the lands were included within the boundaries of a 
National Park System unit. The NPS will grant no extensions. 
Paragraph (a) applies to solid waste disposal sites on both Federal 
and nonfederal lands included within a National Park System unit 
boundaries. 

In the interim, and until the expiration of the permit, permittees 
and/or operators of such sites on Federal or nonfederal lands 
within the boundaries must submit a permit request and 
environmental report. Thus, paragraph (b) states that an operator 
wishing to continue solid waste disposal must request a permit 
within 180 days of the site's designation as lying within the 
boundaries of a National Park System unit. 

The final rule modifies paragraph (c) to delete immediate closure 
as the NPS remedy under part 6 for an operator on Federal or 
nonfederal lands who disposes of solid waste on that land without 
requesting NPS approval as specified in paragraph (b). The final 
rule substitutes instead a broader selection of remedies and 
penalties as defined in  6.12. 

The final rule modifies paragraph (d) to make clear that 
while an operator of a solid waste disposal site on lands 
incorporated within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park 
System may continue to operate until the expiration of the permit 
or other license that existed on the date the lands were 
incorporated into the unit, such an operator may do so, only 
insofar as such operator meets the NPS approval standards of 
 6.5(c).

Section 6.7 Mining Wastes



This section is intended to clarify the relationship between the regulations governing solid waste disposal and
existing regulations at 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, that govern mineral operations.

Section 6.7 (b) and (c) address solid waste disposal by persons conducting mineral operations on the date these regulations
become effective. Section 6.7(b) addresses existing mineral operations within a unit of the National Park System
that are not governed by an NPS-approved part 9 plan of operations or terms of a Federal mineral lease. Such an operation
may continue to dispose of solid waste at a site within a unit only after following the procedures and conditions prescribed
in  6.5, posting financial assurance prescribed by the Regional Director, and obtaining a permit from the Regional
Director under  6.9.

Section 6.7(c) provides that an existing mineral operation, if governed by a plan of operations approved under 36
CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral lease, may continue to operate a solid waste disposal site within a unit of
the National Park System pursuant to the approved plan of operations or lease. In approving the plan of operations,
the Regional Director, under part 9, should have already prescribed conditions to ``* * * mitigate
the adverse effects of solid waste disposal on the property of the United States * * *'' associated
with the operation. Congress prescribed this standard as the basis for regulations that govern all existing solid
waste disposal sites.

Section 6.7(c) makes clear that where an existing mineral operation is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal
mineral lease, the Regional Director's approval of the plan of operations constitutes the permit for operation of
a solid waste disposal site in connection with the mineral operation. Financial assurance is not required, if a bond
has been posted under 36 CFR part 9 or the Bureau of Land Management regulations that govern Federal mineral lessees.

The final regulations allow new solid waste disposal sites by mineral operators within a unit only under the conditions
that Congress prescribed for solid waste disposal at 16 U.S.C. 460

l

-22. Thus, final  6.7(d) addresses solid waste disposal sites operated by persons proposing mineral
operations beginning after the effective date of these regulations. Such an operator is governed by the conditions
at  6.4(a) that preclude any new solid waste disposal sites within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park
System, unless the waste is generated solely by National Park Service activities. Thus, persons who begin mineral
operations after the effective date of the regulations, as all other persons, could not operate a new solid waste disposal
site within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System. Among the alternatives available to mineral operators
are disposing of the solid waste in appropriate facilities outside the unit boundaries, or in an existing solid waste
disposal site in a unit, whose continued operation has been approved by the Regional Director under  6.5 and
permitted under  6.9.

Section 6.7(d) applies to establishment of a solid waste disposal site by a prospective operator, whether the operator
is governed by regulations at 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral lease. Nonetheless, the Regional Director
must ensure that all persons, including those beginning mineral operations within a unit, obey the prohibition on
establishing a new solid waste disposal site on all lands within a unit's boundaries. This task will be relatively
simple where an operator is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or a Federal mineral lease. Where an operator is not so governed,
the Regional Director must inform the operator of, and enforce, the conditions that prohibit a new solid waste disposal
site. To ease the regulatory burden on a mineral operator, nothing in this part prohibits the temporary storage, or
stockpiling for return, or the return of mining overburden to the mine site for reclamation purposes. Such activity
does not constitute creation of a solid waste disposal site and will not be governed by the need to request or possess
a permit, the conditions at  6.4 and  6.5, or the financial assurance requirements of  6.9. This
exception applies only to mining overburden that is not hazardous under EPA regulations at 40 CFR part 261. However,
a mineral operator commencing operations after the effective date of this final rule will not be permitted to permanently
abandon spoil or overburden on their lands, including on patented claims, or other nonfederal lands in a unit. Such
an action constitutes creation of a new ``solid waste disposal site'' which Congress prohibited within the boundaries
of a National Park System unit. The Service recognizes that this requirement may increase the costs of conducting
mining in parks. However, the cost of conducting mining must also include the cost of reclaiming the solid waste remaining
after mining is completed. The NPS cannot reasonably implement congressional intent to prohibit new solid waste
disposal sites in National Park System units, and then allow mining operators to establish such sites in parks in connection
with mining.



Section 6.8 National Park Service Solid Waste Responsibilities



Paragraph (a) prohibits the disposal of solid waste in NPS-operated solid waste disposal sites by persons other than
those engaged in National Park Service activities. ``National Park Service activities'' are defined in  6.3
to include NPS contractors, concessionaires or commercial use licensees. In several instances, persons other than
contractors, concessionaires, or commercial use licensees now dispose of solid waste in NPS operated solid waste
disposal sites on Federal lands. This is an inappropriate use of Federal park lands that the regulations terminate
one year after the effective date of these regulations.

Paragraph (b) directs the NPS to set up special collection program to remove harmful substances from the household
waste stream where appropriate. While wastes generated by households (including hotels and motels) are not hazardous,
they may be harmful to NPS resources. Therefore the NPS, under  6.8, will establish a collection program to remove
such materials from the waste stream in units where the NPS operates a solid waste disposal site. The proposed rule
required that such collections be conducted every six months. The final rule requires it once each year. Each such
park has the latitude to establish a collection program that best meets its circumstances, ranging from a one-day
collection of certain wastes only (used oil, paints, thinners, etc.) to a continually open collection site for all
harmful wastes generated by park residents.

<DOCNO> FR941222-0-00088 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Paragraph (c) requires that the NPS strictly adhere to the regulations at 40 CFR part 244, Solid Waste Management Guidelines
for Beverage Containers. While some units may not be aware of the requirements at 40 CFR part 244 for deposit systems
on Federal facilities, nonetheless the requirements are longstanding. Note that the regulations require (not simply
``recommend'') that Federal facilities maintain deposit and return systems on containers in which ``carbonated
beverages'' are sold. Such containers may be plastic, glass, aluminum or steel. Parks, such as Grand Canyon National
Park, that have voluntary recycling programs are not exempt from final  6.8(c). Mandatory deposit and return
systems are not replaced by voluntary recycling efforts. Rather these two approaches complement each other. As part
of its environmental leadership responsibilities, the NPS seeks to address the solid waste issue with several tools,
including mandatory deposit and return systems for carbonated beverage containers sold by facilities on Federal
lands in units of the National Park System. Individual units that propose not to implement 40 CFR part 244 shall maintain
deposit and return systems while a fully-documented request for non-implementation is being considered.

The final rule inserts a new subsection (d) at  6.8 to address Executive Order 12873, 

Federal Acquisition, Recycling and Waste Prevention. 

That order mandates that all Federal agencies ``shall incorporate waste prevention and recycling in the agency's
daily operations and work.'' This requirement governs not only the NPS but also NPS concessionaires, commercial
use licensees and contractors.



Section 6.9 Permits



The final rule requires that a person proposing to continue, or begin operating a solid waste disposal site within
the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System must possess a permit issued under this part. The regulations exempt
only two classes of persons operating solid waste disposal sites from this permit requirement. They are persons who
reside or farm within a park under  6.2(c) and existing mineral operators described by  6.7(c).

Residents under  6.2(c) do not require a permit and the mineral operator's permit consists of an NPS-approved
plan of operations or Federal lease terms. Also note that  6.2(c)(3) and  6.7(e) exclude some substances
from the ambit of these regulations under certain conditions.

This section also governs the issuing of a permit for the operation of a solid waste disposal site and outlines the contents
of such permits. Section 6.9(b) requires that the Regional Director comply with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) and other pertinent laws and executive orders before issuing a permit.

The Regional Director may find that a proposal meets the conditions under which the NPS may approve a new, or continued
operation of an existing, site. If a proposal meets the conditions, the Regional Director shall then determine, through
preparation of an environmental assessment, whether the Service's approval constitutes a major Federal agency
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. When the Regional Director finds such an effect,
the NPS will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposal.

Section 6.9(d) makes clear that the issuance of a Special Use Permit is the method by which the Regional Director approves
a request and environmental report, and provides that the authority to issue a permit resides with the Regional Director.

Paragraph (e) sets forth the minimum requirements a permit may prescribe for operating a solid waste disposal site.
The requirements are aimed at reducing the potential adverse effects attributable to the operation of such sites
on the property of the United States.



Section 6.10 Financial Assurance



This section prescribes the procedures for financial assurance from a solid waste disposal site operator in a unit
of the National Park System.

The regulations at 40 CFR part 258 require that an operator of a solid waste disposal site for household and certain
other commercial and industrial solid wastes (not including hazardous wastes) must provide an estimate of costs
related to closure and post-closure care responsibilities of the site, and establish sufficient financial assurance
to meet those responsibilities. The NPS sees no need to require added financial assurance, in the form of cash or surety
bond guaranteeing payment or performance, where the operator has provided such a bond under regulations at 40 CFR
258.74(b). Nor will the NPS require financial assurance from an owner or operator of a site that is a State entity whose
debts and liabilities are the debts and liabilities of a State. There is also an exception that may apply to mineral
operators under  6.7(c).

The NPS will require financial assurance when issuing a permit for a new, or continued operation of an existing, solid
waste disposal site if the operator has not posted a bond under 40 CFR 258.74(b).

Section 6.11 Appeals 



This section establishes procedures under which an applicant for 
a new, or continued operation of an existing, solid waste 
disposal site may appeal a Regional Director's decision to the 
National Park Service Director. Among other issues, an aggrieved 
operator may appeal a Regional Director's rejection of a request 
for continued or new operations; or conditions that the Regional 
Director may attach to an approval; or the amount of the bond set 
by the Regional Director. 



Section 6.12 Prohibited Acts and Penalties 



This section of the rule clarifies that operating a solid waste 
disposal site within a unit of the National Park System without a 
permit is prohibited. Operating a site in violation of a term or 
condition of a permit, or in violation of 40 CFR parts 257 or 258, 
or in violation of the equivalent State law or regulation is also 
prohibited. Violations of these provisions subject operators to 
the penalty provisions of 36 CFR 1.3 and/or, where applicable, 
revocation of the permit and/or forfeiture of the bond or security 
deposit. These penalties apply to operators on nonfederal lands 
within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System. 



Federal Paperwork Reduction Act 



The collections of information contained in   6.4, 6.5 and 
6.6 of this rule have been approved by the Office of Management

Applicant reporting time for this collection of information is 
estimated to average 100 hours per response, including the time

Washington, DC 20503. 



Compliance With Other Laws 



In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), the NPS has prepared an environmental 
assessment (EA) of these regulations. The EA examines whether the 
implementation of the regulations will be a major Federal action 
that would have a significant effect on the quality of the human 
environment, requiring the preparation of an environmental impact 
statement. The EA was available for public inspection and comment 
at the National Park Service Office of Environmental Quality, 
located in the Department of Interior Building in Washington, DC 
for a period running concurrently with the comment period for the 
proposed regulations. The Director of the NPS has signed a Finding 
Of No Significant Impact (FONSI) declaring the implementation of 
this regulation not to be a significant Federal action. 

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-511), 
the NPS is requested to perform a regulatory flexibility analysis 
for all rules that may have a significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The NPS has determined that this action 
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small 
entities since the rule deals with the location of future solid 
waste disposal sites and the number of existing solid waste 
disposal sites is small. Consequently, there is no necessity for 
a regulatory flexibility analysis. 

This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review 
under Executive Order 12866. The NPS has reviewed this rule as 
directed by Executive Order 12360, ``Government Actions and 
Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights,'' to 
determine if this rule has ``policies that have takings 
implications.'' The NPS has determined that this rule does not have 
takings implications because the rule will not deny any private 
property owner all beneficial use of their land, nor will it 
significantly reduce their land's value.

 6.5



Solid waste disposal sites in operation on September 1, 1984. 



(a) The operator of a solid waste disposal site in operation 
as of September 1, 1984, within the boundaries of a unit of the 
National Park System, having been in continuous operation on 
January 23, 1995, and who wishes to remain in 
operation, must submit to the proper Superintendent for review by 
the Regional Director, within 180 calendar days of January 23, 1995, a permit request and an environmental 
report as described in  6.4(b) (1)-(9). 

(b) Any operator who fails to submit a request as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section will not be allowed to continue 
operations and must immediately fulfill all applicable closure and 
post-closure care requirements. 

(c) The Regional Director may approve a request to allow 
the continued use of a solid waste disposal site only if the 
operator has shown and the Regional Director finds that: 

(1) Adverse effects resulting from leachate, noise, odor, 
vehicular traffic, litter and other activities upon natural and 
cultural resources will be adequately mitigated; 

(2) The proposed operator meets all other applicable 
Federal, State and local laws and regulations, including permit

NPS-approved existing landfill solid waste disposal site may 
convert that site to a transfer station only after submitting a 
request under paragraph (a) of this section, and only after 
receiving approval from the Regional Director under paragraph (c) 
of this section. The Regional Director may approve such a request, 
if in addition to meeting the standards of paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Regional Director finds that the conversion to a 
transfer station better protects the unit's natural or cultural 
resources than the existing land-fill operation. 



 6.6 

Solid waste disposal sites within new additions to the 
National Park System. 



(a) An operator of a solid waste disposal site located on 
lands or waters added to the National Park System, by act of 
Congress or by proclamation, after January 23, 1995, 
will not be permitted to dispose of solid waste after expiration 
of the permit or license in effect on the date of the land's or 
water's designation as being within a National Park System unit's 
boundaries. The operator must then immediately fulfill all 
applicable closure and post-closure care requirements. 

(b) An operator of a solid waste disposal site located on 
lands or waters designated as being within the boundaries of a unit 
of the National Park System established or expanded after January 23, 1995, who wishes to remain in operation for 
the duration of the existing permit or license, must submit to 

the Regional Director, within 180 calendar days of the land's or 
water's designation as being within a National Park System unit 
boundaries, a permit request and environmental report as 
described in  6.4(b) (1)-(9). 

(c) Any operator who fails to submit a request as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section will be subject to the penalty 
provisions of  6.12. 

(d) If the Regional Director finds that the permit request and 
the environmental report do not meet the conditions for approval 
set forth in  6.5(c), the Regional Director will reject the 
request and notify the proposed operator of the reasons for the 
rejection. Within 90 calendar days of such notice, the operator of 
the solid waste disposal site must cease disposing of solid waste 
at the site. The operator may resume disposing of solid waste only 
upon submission and approval of a permit request and environmental 
report that the Regional Director determines meet the conditions 
set forth in  6.5(c). 



 6.7 

Mining wastes. 



(a) Solid waste from mining includes but is not limited to 
mining overburden, mining byproducts, solid waste from the 
extraction, processing and beneficiation of ores and minerals, 
drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated 
with exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas 
or geothermal energy and any garbage, refuse or sludge associated 
with mining and mineral operations. 

(b) A person conducting mining or mineral operations on January 23, 1995, and not governed by a plan of operations approved
under 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, or pursuant to the terms of a Federal mineral lease, may continue to operate
a solid waste disposal site within the boundaries of a 
unit only after complying with  6.5 and  6.10 and with a permit issued by the Regional Director under  6.9.

(c) A person conducting mining or mineral operations on January 23, 1995, and governed by a plan of 
operations approved under 36 CFR part 9 or pursuant to the terms 
of a Federal mineral lease may continue to operate a solid waste 
disposal site under the terms of the approved plan of 
operations or lease. Where an existing mining or mineral 
operation is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or a Federal mineral 
lease, an NPS-approved plan of operations will constitute the 
permit for solid waste disposal site operation otherwise required 
under  6.9. A bond required under 36 CFR part 9, or by the Bureau 
of Land Management for Federal lessees, will satisfy the 
requirements of  6.10. 

(d) A person proposing to initiate mining or mineral operations 
after January 23, 1995, within the boundaries of a 
unit of the National Park System, whether or not governed by a plan 
of operations approved under 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a 
Federal mineral lease, may not establish or operate a new solid 
waste disposal site within a unit.

Implementation of International Package Consignment Service 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 International Package Consignment Service (IPCS) is an international mail service designed for mail order companies
sending merchandise packages to other countries. The service will be available initially to Japan; Canada will be
added as a destination country in the near future. If feasible, other destination countries will be added as customer
needs dictate. To use IPCS, a customer will be required to mail at least 25,000 packages in 1 year to each country to which
it wants to use the service, and to agree to link its information systems with the Postal Service's so that the Postal
Service can extract certain information about the contents of the customer's packages for customs clearance and
other purposes. The implementation of IPCS will benefit U.S. mail order companies and other customers that export
goods by making it easier and less costly to do so; and all other users of the Postal Service by increasing the total contribution
to fixed costs realized by the Postal Service from its international operations. Interim implementing regulations
have been developed and are set forth below for comment and suggested revision prior to adoption in final form.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction 



With the exception of its International Surface Air Lift (ISAL) and International Priority Airmail (IPA) services
for small packets, which have 4-pound weight limits, and VALUEPOST/CANADA service for small packets, which has a
2-pound weight limit, the Postal Service currently does not offer any bulk international service for customers sending
packages containing merchandise to other countries. As a result, if those customers want to accomplish delivery
through the mail, their only option is to use one of the Postal Service's single-piece international services: Air
Parcel Post, Surface Parcel Post, or Express Mail International Service (EMS). These services are available to customers
mailing as little as one package from anywhere in the United States and are designed and priced accordingly. They provide
the features generally desired by household and small business mailers but do not necessarily provide the features
needed by medium- or large-size business mailers that actively solicit customers in other countries and require
a reliable and cost-effective means of sending large volumes of merchandise from the United States to their international
customers. 

During the past few years, many customers that traditionally have used international mail to send merchandise packages
to other countries have sought more convenient and/or less costly delivery methods. This has been especially true
for customers sending packages to Canada, where the combination of relatively cumbersome customs treatment for
U.S.-origin international mail and Canada Post Corporation's practice of encouraging U.S. businesses to freight
their merchandise packages to Canada and enter them as domestic mail has caused the Postal Service's existing services
to appear increasingly unattractive as delivery methods. 

Two factors in particular make customs clearance of U.S.-origin mail in Canada cumbersome for companies sending
merchandise packages. First, the value threshold at which Revenue Canada rates inbound merchandise packages for
duties and taxes is lower than the corresponding threshold used by most other industrialized nations' customs agencies.
Thus, a relatively high proportion of merchandise packages mailed from the United States to Canada are assessed for
duties and taxes. Second, as happens generally with international mail, any duties and taxes that have been assessed
are collected from the addressee at the time of delivery. However, in the case of Canada, Canada Post Corporation charges
the addressee a customs collection fee of $5 Canadian. In contrast, merchandise packages that clear Canadian customs
as freight can be delivered to the addressee completely prepaid, without the need to collect duties, taxes, and fees
at the time of delivery. 

In addition, customers exporting merchandise to Japan have seen their businesses there detrimentally affected
by the costs they must incur to send merchandise from the United States to Japan. Mail order companies that pass their
delivery costs directly on to their Japanese customers generally are less likely to receive orders as those costs
increase. As a result, even those customers that have continued to use the Postal Service to send merchandise packages
to Japan are continually searching for better and cheaper delivery methods.

Section 403(b)(2) of the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. 403(b)(2), makes it the responsibility of the Postal
Service ``to provide types of mail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail and mail users.'' One of
the most important manifestations of this responsibility in the international area are services that enhance the
ability of U.S. companies to do business in other countries. That can be accomplished both by simplifying the process
those companies use to prepare their packages for mailing and by reducing the costs those companies incur to mail merchandise
to other countries. However, the Postal Service's existing international services for merchandise packages require
those companies to pay the same postage rates as all other customers pay even though very different Postal Service
operations may be involved. 



II. International Package Consignment Service 



A. Rationale 



In order more closely to meet the needs of mail order companies and other customers that send merchandise packages
from the United States to multiple international addressees, the Postal Service is implementing a new international
service, International Package Consignment Service (IPCS). Initially, the service will be available only to Japan.
The Postal Service anticipates offering IPCS to Canada in the near future. To the extent feasible, the Postal Service
will expand the service to include other destination countries in response to requests from customers. In this regard,
the Postal Service specifically requests comments from customers regarding the need for IPCS to destination countries
other than Japan and Canada. 

In addition to making it easier and less costly for U.S. mail order companies and other customers to export goods, the
implementation of IPCS will benefit all users of the Postal Service's other services by decreasing the total revenues
that the Postal Service needs to recover from them. Offering IPCS makes all Postal Service customers better off because
the additional business generated not only covers the extra variable costs it causes, but also enables the Postal
Service to recover its fixed costs from a larger base of customers. 



B. Qualifying Criteria 



A customer that wants to use IPCS will be required to enter into a service agreement with the Postal Service providing
for the following. First, the customer must commit to mail at least 25,000 packages through the service during the
next 12 months to each destination country to which it wants to use IPCS. Second, the customer must designate the Postal
Service as its carrier of choice to each destination country to which it wants to use IPCS. Third, the customer must
agree to link its information systems with the Postal Service's so that (1) the Postal Service and the customer can
exchange data transmissions concerning the customer's packages, and (2) by scanning the customer-provided barcode
on each package, the Postal Service can extract, on an as-needed basis, certain information about the package. 

In general, the information that must be made available to the Postal Service includes: the order number; the package
identification number; the buyer's name and address; the recipient's name and address; the total weight of the package;
the total value of the package; the number of items in the package; and, for each item in the package, its SKU number,
its value, and its country of origin. The exact information required will vary, depending on the destination country
to which the packages are sent. In practice, this requirement means that the customer will have to begin the necessary
systems work by the time it begins using IPCS, and then will have to assist the Postal Service in completing and maintaining
the information systems linkages. The Postal Service will use the extracted information to prepare any necessary
customs forms and package labels, to accept the customer's mail and verify postage payment automatically, and to
provide user-friendly tracking and tracing. 

In addition to these required commitments, which must appear in all IPCS service agreements, arrangements between
the Postal Service and the customer that are technical in nature also may appear in the IPCS service agreement. For
instance, the service agreement may describe the EDI or proprietary file format that will be used to transmit data
between the customer and the Postal Service, as well as the frequency and schedule of transmissions. Similarly, the
service agreement may describe the formats and frequencies for any exception and performance reports that the Postal
Service will provide to the customer. 

The IPCS service agreement will not define the basic terms and conditions of the service, or the rates that the customer
will pay. As discussed below, IPCS is not a customized service. All customers that use IPCS will be offered the same
rates and will receive the same delivery services. New regulations in International Mail Manual (IMM) 620 establish
IPCS and make it generally available at published rates.

III. IPCS to Japan 



A. JFK Processing Facility 



Because of (1) the greater availability of direct air transportation to Japan from JFK International Airport compared
with that available from other airports; (2) the efficiencies created by the Postal Service's being able to process
all IPCS mail to Japan at a single facility designed for that purpose; (3) the efficiencies created by the Postal Service's
being able to dispatch all IPCS mail to Japan from a single facility designed for that purpose; and (4) general operational
and managerial considerations, the Postal Service has determined that all IPCS mail to Japan should be processed
at, and dispatched from, a dedicated facility located at JFK International Airport (the JFK Processing Facility).


If the plant at which the customer's packages originate is located within 500 miles of JFK International Airport,
the Postal Service will accept the packages at the plant and transport them by truck to the JFK Processing Facility
according to a schedule agreed upon by the Postal Service and the customer. If the customer's plant is located more
than 500 miles from JFK International Airport, the customer will be required to present the packages to the Postal
Service for verification at the plant and transport them as a drop shipment to the JFK Processing Facility according
to a schedule agreed upon by the Postal Service and the customer. The Postal Service is imposing this requirement because
the IPCS customer will be in a better position than the Postal Service to arrange for cost-effective air or long-haul
surface transportation that meets the customer's package preparation schedule and other operational requirements.
Although the Postal Service initially will require all IPCS mail to Japan to be brought to the JFK Processing Facility,
the Postal Service specifically requests comments from customers regarding the need for an additional processing
site in another part of the country, such as the Seattle or San Francisco metropolitan areas. 



B. Customs Forms 



Packages mailed to Japan through IPCS will not be required to bear customs forms when they are tendered to the Postal
Service. After scanning the customer-printed barcode on each package and correlating it with the package-specific
information transmitted by the customer, the Postal Service will print the necessary customs forms and then affix
them to the customer's packages as part of the processing operation at the JFK Processing Facility. However, during
the interim period in which the Postal Service and the customer are working together to establish the information
systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this, the customer will be required to prepare the necessary
customs forms on its own and affix the forms to the packages before tendering them to the Postal Service. 



C. Delivery Options 



Within the framework of IPCS to Japan, the Postal Service will offer three delivery options: Express Service, Standard
Air Service, and Economy Air Service. While the weight limit for Express Service and Standard Air Service packages
will be 44 pounds, the weight limit for Economy Air Service packages will be 4 pounds. 

Express Service will be the fastest option and will provide tracking and tracing and insurance at no additional cost.
The Postal Service will transport Express Service packages to Japan by air, where they will receive special handling
by Japan Post and expedited delivery. Each package sent by this option must bear a label identifying it as an Express
Service package (Label 11-B, 

Express Mail Service Post Office to Addressee, 

or an alternative label acceptable to Japan Post). Before or after scanning the customer-printed barcode on each
package and correlating it with the package-specific information transmitted by the customer, the Postal Service
will prepare the necessary labels and affix them to the customer's Express Service packages as part of the processing
operation at the JFK Processing Facility. However, during the interim period in which the Postal Service and the customer
are working together to establish the information systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this,
the customer will be able to use Express Service by preparing the necessary labels on its own and affixing the labels
to the packages before tendering them to the Postal Service. 

Standard Air Service will be the next fastest delivery option and will provide confirmation of dispatch from the United
States.

<DOCNO> FR941222-0-00099 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 
Insurance will be available for Standard Air Service packages weighing more than 1 pound at an additional cost. The
Postal Service will transport Standard Air Service packages by air to Japan, where they will enter Japan Post's domestic
airmail system for delivery. 



Economy Air Service will be the slowest delivery option and will provide confirmation of dispatch from the United
States. No insurance will be available for Economy Air Service packages. The Postal Service will transport Economy
Air Packages by air to Japan, where they will enter Japan Post's domestic surface mail system for delivery. 




D. Rates 





The base rates for the three delivery options are set forth below. The base rates may be reduced by any or all of four additive
annual discounts depending on how many packages the customer mails to Japan through IPCS. 



For each delivery option, the Postal Service will charge the base rates, at 1-pound increments, for the first 100,000
packages mailed by the customer during the 12-month period. Once the customer has mailed 100,000 packages, postage
for the customer's next 150,000 packages will be reduced by 4.75% from the base rates. Packages mailed through any
of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting the 100,000-package threshold. 



Once the customer has mailed 250,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's next 250,000
packages will be reduced by an additional 5.75% taking into account the first discount. That is, postage will be calculated
for these 150,000 packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, and then reducing that
total by a further 5.75%. Again, packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's
meeting the 250,000-package threshold. 



Once the customer has mailed 500,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's next 500,000
packages will be reduced by an additional 6.00% taking into account the first two discounts. That is, postage will
be calculated for these 500,000 packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, then
reducing that total by a further 5.75%, and then reducing that total by a further 6.00%. Again, packages mailed through
any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting the 500,000-package threshold. 



Once the customer has mailed 1,000,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's remaining
packages will be reduced by an additional 6.25% taking into account the first three discounts. That is, postage will
be calculated for the remaining packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, then
reducing that total by a further 5.75%, then reducing that total by a further 6.00%, and then reducing that total by
6.25%. Again, packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting
the 1,000,000-package threshold.

IV. Legal Issues 



On May 16, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled against the Postal Service in the case of


UPS Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. 

v. 

U.S. Postal Service 

and enjoined it from offering International Customized Mail (ICM) service. ICM was a new service in which the Postal
Service negotiated service features and rates with qualifying customers that entered into service agreements.
To qualify for ICM service, a customer had to be capable of annually tendering to the Postal Service at least 1 million
pounds of international mail or paying at least $2 million in international postage, and of tendering all of its mail
to the Postal Service at one location. ICM enabled the Postal Service to provide customer-specific service offerings
at rates that reflected the specific costs incurred in providing the service. Rates and services in any ICM service
agreement were available to any customer qualifying for the service that sent mail with similar characteristics
and that undertook the same preparation and work-sharing specified in the service agreement. 

The District Court first held that UPS, as a competitor of the Postal Service, had standing to challenge ICM service
even though it did not allege that ICM rates were predatory. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates violated
section 403(b)(2) of the Postal Reorganization Act (Act), 39 U.S.C. 403(b)(2), because ICM agreements were with
individual mailers and section 403(b)(2) limits the Postal Service to providing services and establishing rates
for categories of mail and mailers consisting of more than one mailer. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates
were unduly discriminatory because a mailer had to be capable of posting 1 million pounds of mail or paying $2 million
annually in postage to be eligible for the service, but did not have to tender those minimum volumes to the Postal Service
to receive ICM service. Under those circumstances, the Court concluded, different mailers could be paying different
rates for similar mail and mail services. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates inequitably apportioned
the costs of postal services because smaller mailers that could meet the minimum capabilities requirements did not
have access to ICM rates even if they mailed similar quantities of mail. Finally, the District Court concluded that
ICM rates were illegal because under section 407 of the Act, 39 U.S.C. 407, the Postal Service had to obtain the consent
of the President to establish international rates, and the Postal Service had not obtained Presidential consent
for ICM rates. 

The Postal Service is appealing the District Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and
is confident that it will prevail on appeal. Notwithstanding the appeal, however, the Postal Service recognizes
that it is obligated to comply with the terms of the District Court's injunction as long as it is in effect, and that IPCS
may be challenged under the same legal theories that UPS used to challenge ICM service. Consequently, when designing
IPCS, the Postal Service avoided those features of ICM service that the District Court found to be inconsistent with
the Act. 

First, IPCS will be available, under the same terms and conditions and at the same rates, to any customer that can meet
the qualifying criteria. All customers that use IPCS to mail packages to a particular country will receive the same
delivery services. Further, all IPCS customers will pay the same base rates and will be able to take advantage of the
same volume discounts. Thus, all customers using IPCS to Japan, even those that eventually mail 500,000 or more packages
during a 12-month period, will pay the same rates for their first 100,000 packages. Similarly, all customers will
pay the same rates for their next 150,000 packages. 

Second, the volume-based qualifying criteria will be based on the actual number of packages that the customer will
tender, not on the customer's potential volume. In selecting 25,000 packages per 12 months per country as the qualifying
threshold, the Postal Service struck a balance between its desire to provide the service to as many customers as practicable
and its need to be able to recover the costs associated with providing the service, including the costs of establishing
the necessary information system linkages. 

In light of the foregoing, the implementation of IPCS is fully consistent not only with the provisions of the Act that
govern international rates and services, but also with the District Court's decision in

 UPS Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. 

v. 

U.S. Postal Service. 



V. Conclusion 



Accordingly, the Postal Service hereby adopts IPCS to Japan, on an interim basis, at the rates set forth in the schedule
above. Although 39 U.S.C. 407 does not require advance notice and opportunity for submission of comments, and the
Postal Service is exempted by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the advance notice requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act regarding proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553), the Postal Service invites interested persons to submit written
data, views, or arguments concerning the interim rule.

627 Customs Forms Required 



The mailer is not normally required to affix customs forms to IPCS packages sent to Japan. The Postal Service prints
the necessary customs forms based on the package-specific information transmitted by the mailer, and affixes them
to the packages. However, during the interim period in which the Postal Service and the mailer are establishing the
information systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this, the mailer is required to affix the
appropriate customs forms to the packages, as follows: 

a. Express Service: Form 2966-A, 

Parcel Post Customs Declaration_United States of America. 

b. Standard Air Service: Form 2966-A, Parcel Post Customs Declaration_United States of America 

(packages weighing 1 pound or less must bear Form 2976, 

Customs_Douane C1

). 

c. Economy Air Service: Form 2976, 

Customs_Douane C1. 



628 Preparation Requirements 

628.1 Express Service 



Every package sent through Express Service must bear a label identifying it as an Express Service package. The mailer
is not normally required to affix this label. The Postal Service prints the necessary label and affixes it to the Express
Service package. However, during the interim period in which the Postal Service and the mailer are establishing the
information systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this, the mailer is required to affix Label
11-B, Express Mail Service Post Office to Addressee, 

or an alternative label as instructed by the Postal Service, to every Express Service package. 



628.2 Standard Air Service 



There are no Japan-specific preparation requirements for packages sent through Standard Air Service (packages
weighing 1 pound or less must bear the SMALL PACKET marking). See 264.21. 



628.3 Economy Air Service 



Packages sent through Economy Air Service must bear the SMALL PACKET marking. See 264.21.

<DOCTITLE>Revisions to Weight and Preparation Standards for Barcoded Letter Mail </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning the maximum weight of an automation-compatible
barcoded letter-size mailpiece. Subject to additional preparation requirements, certain barcoded mailpieces
weighing more than 3 ounces will be acceptable at Barcoded rates for a trial period of up to 1 year. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 14, 1994, the Postal Service published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 35873-35875) a proposed rule to amend the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards for the physical characteristics
of automation-compatible barcoded letter-size mail. For a period of up to 1 year, the Postal Service proposed to conduct
a live test of barcoded bulk third-class regular rate letter mail weighing between 3.0 and 3.3067 ounces, and First-,
second-, and bulk third-class nonprofit rate letter mail weighing between 3.0 and 3.3363 ounces. 



Although the Postal Service believes that this mail can benefit from barcoding (as the means of moving this mail into
an automated processing environment), it also believes that this benefit can be achieved only under specific standards
governing the construction and preparation of this ``heavy letter mail.'' Thus, the proposed new standards required
that each ``heavy letter'' mailpiece comply with the following: 

(1) Be part of a mailing that is 100 percent delivery point barcoded. 

(2) Have the barcode in the address block. 

(3) Be in an envelope that has no open windows. 

(4) Not be bound or have stiff enclosures. 

The Postal Service proposed to set the maximum weight for Barcoded rate letter-size mailpieces at 3.3363 ounces (or
3.3067 ounces for pieces mailed at regular bulk third-class rates), the break points between the bulk third-class
minimum per-piece rates and the two-part piece/pound rates then in effect. (These values increase to 3.3376 and 3.3071
ounces, respectively, when R94 rates are implemented on January 1, 1995. The increased values are used in the text
and DMM revisions appearing below.) If the maximum weight were set at 3.3 ounces, a small amount of letter-size minimum
per-piece mail would be excluded from the rates otherwise available to letter mail. For simplicity and consistency,
the maximum weight for First- and second-class barcoded letter mail was also proposed to be set at 3.3376 ounces. For
regular bulk third-class rate only, the maximum is set at 3.3071 ounces, which is its ``break point.'' If the proposed
test or changes in the ``break point'' indicate that this alignment is not in the best interest of the Postal Service,
the maximum weight will be adjusted accordingly. 

The Postal Service received 14 comments on the proposed rule, including three from mailing industry trade associations,
one from a mailing-related business, and 10 from companies and corporations. The specific topics covered in those
comments are discussed below. 



Consideration of Letter Mail Heavier Than 3.0 Ounces for Automation Rates 



All 14 commenters expressed support for the Postal Service's efforts to conduct live tests of barcoded letters weighing
between 3.0 and 3.3376 ounces (or 3.3071 ounces for third-class regular rate mail). 

One commenter encouraged consideration for a much higher weight limit. The Postal Service believes that for the heavy
letter-mail test period, the maximum weight should be limited to 3.3376 ounces. Previous controlled tests conducted
by the Postal Service revealed that increased problems (such as damage, jams, and throughput) arose or worsened with
mail heavier than 3.3376 ounces. 

Another commenter (a mailing company) supported the Postal Service's effort but expressed doubts that presort service
bureaus would accept address-block barcoded heavy letter mail to run through their automated equipment because
of possible machine jams, lowered machine throughput, and the requirement for 100 percent delivery point barcoding.
Participation in this test is voluntary. Although the Postal Service realizes that some companies will be unable
to participate, it does not believe that the objectives of the test can be served if the test criteria are altered. The
Postal Service believes that it will be able, under the requirements adopted by this rule, to obtain sufficient participation
to conduct a valid test. 



Requirement for Enveloped Mailpieces 



Two comments were received opposing the proposed standard that all heavy letter mail be in envelopes. One commenter
thought that the heavy letter mail tests should be conducted using mailpieces constructed under current standards
and encouraged the use of tabbed catalogs during the trial period. One commenter recommended the inclusion of self-mailers.


The Postal Service believes that only enveloped mail should be tested as part of this trial and that the proposed restriction
on self-mailers and on bound or booklet-type mail should remain. The preliminary tests were performed only on enveloped
mailpieces that were heavier than 3.0 ounces and not on tabbed catalogs. The Postal Service has recently tested tabbed
catalogs weighing 3.3 ounces on its automated equipment and found that such pieces caused equipment jams and were
more susceptible to damage. As a result, the Postal Service believes that it is prudent to proceed to test only enveloped
mail. Accordingly, that portion of the proposed rule that specified only enveloped mail would be eligible for the
test will be retained in the final rule. 

In allowing only enveloped mail in the proposed test, the Postal Service is seeking to evaluate the performance of
heavy letter mail having the best opportunity for successful automated processing, insofar as that can be predicted
by physical criteria. Accordingly, in addition to retaining its focus on enveloped mail, the Postal Service also
wishes to point out that by including heavy letter mail in the general category of automation-compatible mail for
the test period, it is expecting that this mail will be prepared in trays, as is currently the case for other automation-compatible
letter mail. Although the proposed rule did not explicitly discuss this point, the Postal Service finds it appropriate
to emphasize this point in the final rule as a logical corollary to the temporary transfer of heavy letter mail into
the automation-compatible category. 



Restriction of Open-Windowed Envelopes 



Four comments were received opposing the standard that heavy letter mail not be in envelopes with open windows. 

The Postal Service has conducted tests in which preliminary results indicate that open windows on mailpieces above
3.0 ounces have a greater tendency to snag on automated processing equipment. The Postal Service is also concerned
about damage to the heavy letter mailpieces with open windows and other mail that might be adjacent to it during automated
processing. Thus, the Postal Service has determined to retain the proposed prohibition of open-windowed envelopes
in the final rule. 



100% Delivery Point Barcode Requirement

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941222-0-00107 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Nine comments were received opposing the standard that mailings of heavy letter pieces be 100 percent delivery point
barcoded. Eight commenters stated that 100 percent delivery point barcoding would discourage or inhibit them from
participating in the test and requested that barcoding levels be set at the 85 percent level now generally applicable
to Barcoded rate letter mailings. 

Seven commenters stated that 100 percent delivery point barcoding would require splitting their mailings into two
streams_one delivery point barcoded stream and one not. Several commenters stated that splitting the mail into two
such streams would negate the benefits of the automation rate. One commenter stated that his company already splits
the mail into two streams and meets the 100 percent requirement. 

Four commenters stated that no major mailer today has been able to ZIP+4 code 100 percent of its mailing. 

The Postal Service believes that the requirement for 100 percent delivery point barcoding of all heavy letter mail
is necessary. As part of an effort to get a barcode on all mail, the Postal Service routinely processes on an optical
character reader (OCR) all mailpieces rejected from barcode sorters in an effort to read the delivery address and
print a barcode in the lower right corner of the mailpiece. However, heavy letter mail will not run through OCRs; attempts
to process and barcode such mail on an OCR revealed that significant damage occurred to the heavy letter pieces and
that any barcodes printed in the barcode clear zone by the OCR were often unreadable. (The increased thickness caused
the bottom edges of the heavy letter mail envelopes to be rounded and to buckle when bent. Because of the curvature and
irregular surface created by the rounding and buckling of the heavy mailpiece, barcodes printed in the lower right
corner of such mailpieces by the OCR were outside the working specifications of postal barcode readers and, as a result,
useless for automated processing.) 

The additional OCR processing of non-delivery point barcoded heavy letter mail, the labor to repair damaged pieces,
and the ensuing manual or mechanized handling of that mail amount to unreasonable additional costs for the Postal
Service, well beyond that appropriate for Barcoded rate mail. As a result, the proposed rule's provisions for a 100
percent delivery point barcoded mailstream for heavy letter mail will be retained in the final rule. 



Follow Current Postal Requirements for Heavy Letter Mail 



Six commenters stated that the heavy letter mail trial period should be run using the current standards for automation
rate mail and that no additional constraints should be imposed. 

The Postal Service believes that modification of the current standards for automation-compatible mail are necessary
based on the results of controlled tests already performed on heavy letter mail as previously described. If appropriate
additional standards are not imposed on heavy letter mail, consistent with the results of earlier tests, the Postal
Service believes that live mail testing will have no chance for success and that greater customer dissatisfaction
would result than may occur with the heavy letter mail standards adopted by this rule. 



Barcode Window Placement 



One commenter objected to extending the barcode window to the bottom of the envelope. 

The section referred to by the commenter applies only to lower right corner barcode windows. The Postal Service does
not intend to add new standards to DMM C840.6.0, only to limit the use of lower right corner barcode windows to mailpieces
weighing 3.0 ounces or less. 



Requirements for Identification of Test Mail 



Before the Postal Service can determine whether a permanent increase in the maximum weight for barcoded letter mail
is appropriate, it must determine whether the impact of heavy letter mail is acceptable. Accurate evaluation of the
test data will depend in part on the Postal Service's ability to identify, measure, and monitor heavy letter mail as
it enters and moves through the mailstream. Accordingly, test participants will be required to take specific measures
to identify heavy letter mail to enable the Postal Service to gather the necessary data for this test. Although not
specifically discussed in the proposed rule, the importance of mail identification became evident as the comments
were being reviewed, and provisions requiring identification are being introduced in the final rule as reasonable
and logical elements of the test process. 

Specifically, the Postal Service will require that each container of heavy mail be clearly identified when submitted
by the mailer. Pallets, general purpose mail containers, and other similar equipment used to transport trays of heavy
letter mail will require labels (placards) bearing the words ``HEAVY LETTER MAIL'' in letters not less than 1/2 inch
high. These labels must be white or light-colored stock, not smaller than 8 by 11 inches, and placed on two adjacent
sides of the pallet or other equipment. Each tray of heavy letter mail must also be identified by a flag (similar to a
separator card) clearly marked ``HEAVY LETTER MAIL'' and placed in front of the contents of the tray. No marking will
be required on the pieces of heavy letter mail themselves other than as required by the class or rate claimed, or by the
postage payment method used. 

Participants in the heavy letter mail test will also be asked to provide documentation for any heavy letter mailing
exceeding 100,000 pieces. Requested information includes the mailer's name and contact person for test information,
the mailing's contents (size, weight, volume, level of presort, and proportion of heavy letter mail), and the mailing's
distribution (place(s) of mailing and destination ZIP Code ranges). This information, which should be provided
to the address below at least 3 weeks before mailing, will allow the Postal Service adequate time to conduct on-site
evaluation and data collection for test mail. Documentation of heavy letter mailings should be addressed to: 

Manager Customer Mail Preparation, 

USPS Headquarters Rm 6912, 

475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., 

Washington DC 20260-6805. 

If heavy letter mail is damaged in processing during this test period, the mailer will be asked to recall the damaged
pieces before delivery (by completing Form 1509) to allow their examination for evaluation of both the cause of the
damage and possible remedies for that cause.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 31, 1985, June 29, 1988, and August 19, 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources
(PADER) formally submitted amendments to 25 Pa Code Chapter 121_General Provisions and Chapter 129_Standards for
VOC as SIP revisions. These revisions were submitted by PADER to correct existing deficiencies in its VOC regulations
and to control emissions as part of the Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) Fix-up requirement of Section
182 of the CAA. Specifically, this document approves the addition of  129.72_Manufacture of Sulfonates (Surface
Active Agents) and  129.71_Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry Equipment (SOCMI) Leaks into
the PADER SIP submitted on December 31, 1985 and June 29, 1988, as well as amendments to the following section of 25 PA
Code  121.4_Regional Organization of the Department;  129.51 General_VOC Recordkeeping Requirements;
 129.52_Surface Coating;  129.62_General Standards for Bulk Gasoline Terminals, Bulk Gasoline Plants
and Small Gasoline Storage Tanks;  129.66_Compliance Schedules and Final Compliance Dates;  129.67_Graphic
Arts; and  129.69_Pneumatic Rubber Tire Manufacturing;  129.72_Manufacture of Sulfonates (Surface
Active Agents) and  129.71_Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI) Equipment Leaks contained
in the August 19, 1992 submittal. 


The December 31, 1985 and June 29, 1988 submittals also included a request that EPA approve the addition of the Commonwealth's
wood cabinet and wood furniture finishing rule into the Pennsylvania's SIP. That regulation is the subject of a separate
rulemaking document. 
On May 26, 1988, EPA issued a SIP call letter to Pennsylvania notifying the Commonwealth that its SIP was substantially
inadequate to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. In a June 14, 1988 follow-up letter,
EPA notified PADER of deficiencies in its existing VOC regulations which needed to be corrected in order to make the
regulations consistent with EPA policy and guidance. A SIP call letter is a finding made by EPA that the SIP does not
provide for attainment by the required date, (section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H);
42 U.S.C. 7410(A)(K)(5)). EPA's review of this material indicates that PADER has addressed the deficiencies pertaining
to the correction of State VOC regulations required by section 182(a)(2)(A) and section 184(b) of the Act, as amended
in 1990.

Section 129.51_General 


Section 129.51(d) was amended to add general recordkeeping requirements for regulated sources of VOCs subject to
the emission limitations and control requirements in Chapter 129. Section 129.51 requires the owner or operator
of a facility or source to keep records to demonstrate compliance with the applicable limitation or control requirement.
Those records are to provide sufficient data and calculations which clearly demonstrate that the emission limitations
or control requirements are met. The data or information required to determine compliance with the applicable limitation
are to be recorded and maintained in a timeframe consistent with the averaging period of the standard. The records
are to be retained at least two years and made available to PADER on request. A facility or source which claims exemption
from the emission limitations and control requirements is to maintain records adequate to demonstrate that the facilities
and sources are entitled to the exemption. 


Section 129.52_Surface Coating Processes 



Section 129.52(a) was changed to expand the applicability of the surface coating requirements to statewide for facilities
with emissions greater than 2.7 tons/yr., 15 lbs/day, or 3 lbs/hr. before controls. 



Section 129.62_General Standards for Bulk Gasoline Terminals, Bulk Plants and Small Gasoline Storage Tanks 


Subsection (c) specifies that a person may not allow a gasoline tank truck subject to  129.59_Bulk Gasoline
Terminals,  129.60_Bulk Gasoline Plants or  129.61_Small Gasoline Storage Tank Control to be filled
or emptied statewide unless the gasoline tank truck meets the requirement below. 

The word ``annual'' was deleted from subsection (c)(1) to add ``12 months.'' The gasoline tank truck leak check requirement
was revised to clarify the annual gasoline tank truck leak check requirement to add that the owner or operator subject
to the requirements of  129.62(c) may not allow a tank to be filled or emptied statewide unless the gasoline tank
truck has been tested by the owner or operator within the immediately preceding 12 months in accordance to the applicable
test method and procedure in  139.14_Emissions of VOCs. 



Section 129.66_Compliance Schedules and Final Compliance Dates 


This regulation adds a one year compliance interval for existing sources newly subject to the requirements of  129.52,
  129.59-129.61,   129.67-129.69 as a result of the revised applicability requirements,
and to the newly affected pneumatic rubber manufacturing facilities and surface coating processes subject to the
emission standards. Newly subject sources or 
facilities are those existing sources which were not previously subject to the emission limitations because they
emitted less than the cutoff levels or operated at de minimis production levels prior to the date of publication of
the limitation in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, but are now subject to the standard because they meet or exceed the cutoff
levels; compliance shall be achieved by May 23, 1993. Section 129.68_Manufacture of Synthesized Pharmaceutical
Products was deleted from this section because the compliance schedule (August 3, 1992) for this source category
was the subject of a separate rulemaking. 


Section 129.67_Graphic Arts Systems 


Section 129.67(e) establishes a requirement that the emissions of VOCs used in clean-up operations shall be summed
with emissions from surface coating and printing to determine the applicability of the graphic arts regulatory requirements.



Section 129.69_Manufacture of Pneumatic Rubber Tires 


The VOC control requirements in Section 129.69(a) are revised to delete the 5,000 tire/day exemption level, add the
definitions of pneumatic rubber tire manufacture and passenger type tire, specify minimum control requirements
for tire manufacturing, and allow an affected tire manufacturer to petition for approval of an alternative RACT control
program. Such an alternative must be approved by PADER and EPA as a SIP revision. 
Pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing is defined as the production of pneumatic rubber passenger-type on a mass production
basis, and passenger-type tires are agricultural, airplane, industrial, mobile home, light or medium duty truck
or passenger vehicle tires with bead diameters up to 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) and cross-sectional dimensions
up to 12.8 inches (32.5 centimeters). 
In addition, this section adds that the production of specialty tires for antique or other vehicles, when produced
on an irregular basis or with short production runs and when produced on equipment separate from normal production
lines for passenger-type tires, are exempt from the requirements of this section upon written approval from PADER.

Subsection (b)(1) clarifies the requirement that the owner or operator of an undertread cementing, tread-end cementing
or bead dipping operation subject to this section shall install and operate a capture system designed to achieve maximum
reasonable capture of at least 85% by weight of VOC emitted, from all undertread cementing, tread-end cementing and
bead dipping operations.

Subsection (c)(1) deletes the 5% VOC content water-based spray limit provision.

Subsection (d) deletes the 0.161 pound per tire emission limit, and adds the requirement that as an alternative to
meeting the specified control level, an affected facility may develop and implement an alternative RACT control
program if the program is approved by the PADER and EPA as a SIP revision.



Section 129.71_Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing-Fugitive Sources



Section 129.71(a) applies to surface active agent manufacturing facilities subject to  129.72 (relating
to manufacturing of surface active agents) and to facilities with design capability to manufacture 1,000 tons per
year (tpy) or more of one or a combination of synthetic organic chemicals listed in 40 CFR 60.489 (relating to list of
chemicals provided by affected facilities), Methyl tert-butyl ether, polyethylene, polypropylene, or polystyrene.
The previous 4,000 tpy applicability level was deleted.

Subsection (c) requires the owner or operator of a newly affected facility to complete, develop and initiate a leak
detection program including liquid leaks for pumps, valves, compressors, vessels, and safety pressure relief valves
and a repair program for these components that cause a hydrocarbon detection instrument reading equal to or greater
than 10,000 ppm not later than May 23, 1993. The leak detection and repair program shall include the following: a leak
check during every quarter of all components, by methods referenced in  139.14; a waterproof identification
tag is to be attached to the leaking component (that is causing the instrument to read greater than 10,000 ppm) with
the identification number and the date which the leak was detected in a visible area; the repair and retest of a leaking
component must be done within 15 days from the date of detection; and the identification tag must indicate if the component
cannot be repaired until a process shutdown that will not occur within 15 days from the date of detection.

Subsection (2)(iv) was revised to require a weekly visual check of all pumps in light liquid service for indications
of leaks.

The fugitive emission leak check requirements in  139.14 (relating to emissions of VOCs) were separated from
subsection (2)(iv) and added as a new subsection, (2)(v). This new subsection specifies that safety relief valves
are subject to the requirements for rechecking within 24 hours. The requirements for the recordkeeping and reporting
of the leak detection and repair program were separated from subsection (2)(iv) and added as a new subsection, (2)(vi).



Section 129.72_Manufacture of Surface Active Agents



Section 129.72 requires a leak detection program (see  129.71 synthetic organic chemical and polymer manufacturing
fugitive sources). Subsection (b) of this section was amended to clarify the emission control system efficiency
requirements for surface active agent manufacturing facilities with potential VOC emissions of greater than 100
tpy. Emission of VOCs in ambient air from solvent wash tanks, reaction vessels, separators, distillation processes,
solvent trippers and solvent storage tanks may not be caused or permitted by any person unless the emissions are exhausted
through an emission reduction system which is designed and operated to recover or destroy at least 90% by weight of
the VOC emissions exhausted to the emission reduction system.

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking because the Agency
views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document
in this 

Federal Register

 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective February 21, 1995, unless, within 30 days of publication, adverse or critical comments are received.

If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a document that
will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based
on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties
interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised
that this action will be effective on February 21, 1995.



Final Action



EPA is approving the addition of and revision to Pennsylvania's SIP to control VOCs from  129.52 - surface coating,
 129.69 - pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing,  129.67 - graphic arts and  129.72 - synthetic organic
chemical manufacturing industry equipment leaks which were submitted to EPA on December 31, 1985, June 29, 1988 and
August 19, 1992. These revisions meet part of the RACT Fix-up requirement of the Act, as amended.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C.   603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the Commonwealth is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 21, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

The Regional Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove Pennsylvania's SIP revisions to control VOCs from
surface coating, pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing, graphic arts and synthetic organic chemical manufacturing
industry equipment leaks SIP revision will be based on whether it meets the requirements of Section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K),
and Part D of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 51.

Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of embargoes.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces that, in adherence to regulations and court orders, yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin
tuna harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) by purse seine vessels of Colombia or the Republic of Vanuatu
are prohibited from entry into the United States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) (16 U.S.C. 1361 

et

 

seq

.) requires a ban on the importation of commercial fish or products from fish that have been caught with commercial
fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or serious injury of marine mammals in excess of U.S. standards.
In the case of yellowfin tuna harvested by purse seine in the ETP, the MMPA requires a ban unless the harvesting nation
has a program and performance that is comparable in its level of marine mammal protection to that of the United States.
The regulatory program of the harvesting nation must include, among other things, such prohibitions against encircling
certain schools of dolphin, conducting sundown sets, and other activities as are applicable to U.S. vessels under
the marine mammal program of the United States (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(2)(B)(I)). MMPA regulations require that harvesting
nations implement marine mammal protection requirements within 180 days of the date that such requirements are placed
on U.S. vessels (50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(v)(B)).


On November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58285), NMFS published a final rule declaring the northeastern stock of offshore spotted
dolphin (

Stenella

 

attenuata

) to be depleted under section 3(1) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1362(1)). On January 27, 1994, the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California in the case of 

Earth Island Institute v. Brown

, No. C 88-1380 TEH, enjoined NMFS, effective immediately, from permitting any incidental taking of any northeastern
offshore spotted dolphin in the ETP, and required that NMFS include this prohibition in the comparability requirements
for foreign nations. On February 1, 1994, NMFS notified U.S. vessels fishing under the general permit issued to the
American Tunaboat Association (ATA general permit) that all sets on the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin
were prohibited due to the stock's recently determined status as depleted under the MMPA. On February 4, 1994, NMFS
further advised those vessels that the take of all offshore spotted dolphin was prohibited immediately under the
provisions of the January 27, 1994, order requiring NMFS to minimize the take of northeastern offshore spotted dolphin.
On February 8, NMFS, in order to ensure that the aggregate dolphin mortality quota mandated by the International Dolphin
Conservation Act was not exceeded, prohibited the taking of any additional dolphin, regardless of species or stock,
under the ATA general permit, thus closing the fishery.
On February 22, 1994, NMFS published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 8417) of the January 27, 1994, court order, and of the February 1, 4, and 8, 1994, NMFS actions discussed above.
The prohibition on the take of any of the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin has been incorporated as a
new element in the marine mammal program of the United States. On August 24, 1994, with a subsequent technical correction
on September 19, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California amended its order of January
27, 1994, and specified that its prohibition applied only in the area from 40




 N. lat. to 5




 N. lat., and from 120




 W. long. to the coastline of Central and South America.
As of September 28, 1994, NMFS had not received documentary evidence from Colombia or from the Republic of Vanuatu
that either nation has incorporated into its marine mammal protection program a prohibition on encircling with a
purse seine net any school in which a northeastern offshore spotted dolphin is observed. Therefore, because the 180-day
period allowed for a foreign nation to adopt a comparable prohibition expired on July 26, 1994, in adherence to the
regulations and court orders cited above, NMFS on September 28, 1994, notified the U.S. Customs Service, and here
announces, an immediate ban on imports of yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels of Columbia and
the Republic of Vanuatu.

Foreign Fishing; Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska




<AGENCY>

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim 1995 initial specifications of groundfish, associated management measures, and closures.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues interim 1995 initial total allowable catches for each category of groundfish and specifications for
prohibited species bycatch allowances for the groundfish fishery of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). NMFS is closing specified
fisheries consistent with the interim 1995 groundfish specifications. The intended effect is to conserve and manage
the groundfish resources in the GOA.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The domestic and foreign groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA are managed by NMFS according
to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific
Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
The FMP is implemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fisheries at 50 CFR parts
672, 676, and 677. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. 

This action provides certain specifications for the 1995 fishing year on a preliminary or interim basis, including:
(1) Specifications of total allowable catch (TAC) for each groundfish target species category in the GOA and apportionments
thereof among domestic annual processing (DAP), joint venture processing (JVP), total allowable level of foreign
fishing (TALFF), and reserves; (2) apportionments of reserves to DAP; (3) apportionments of the sablefish TAC to
vessels using hook-and-line and trawl gear; (4) apportionments of pollock TAC; (5) apportionments of Pacific cod
TAC; (6) ``other species'' TAC; (7) halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits; (8) seasonal allocations of the
halibut PSC limits, (9) interim groundfish harvest specifications, (10) the opening date of the directed fishery
for sablefish for hook-and-line gear, and (11) closures to directed fishing. A discussion of each of these measures
follows. 



1. Proposed Establishment of TACs and Apportionments Thereof Among Domestic Annual Processing (DAP), Joint Venture
Processing (JVP), Total Allowable Level of Foreign Fishing (TALFF), and Reserves 



Under  672.20(c)(1)(ii), NMFS, after consultation with the Council, publishes in the 

Federal Register

 preliminary specifications of annual TACs and interim harvest limits. These preliminary specifications indicate
apportionments of TACs among DAP, JVP, reserves, and TALFF for each target species and the ``other species'' category.
The sum of the TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield (OY) range, of 116,000-800,000
metric tons (mt), established for these species. 

Species TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves under   611.92(c)(1) and
672.20(a)(2). DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP
amounts are intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea.
TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Existing harvesting and processing capacity of the
U.S. industry is capable of utilizing the entire 1995 TAC specification for GOA groundfish. Therefore, the Council
recommended that DAP equal TAC for each species category, resulting in no proposed amounts of TALFF or JVP for the 1995
fishing year. 

The reserves for the GOA are 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish target species categories, and
``other species.'' Given that the GOA groundfish TACs have been utilized fully by DAP since 1987, NMFS has reapportioned
all the reserves to DAP. 

The Council met from September 28 to October 5, 1994, to review scientific information concerning groundfish stocks.
The preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, prepared and presented to the Council by the GOA Plan Team (Plan
Team), summarizes the best available scientific information. 

The September 1994 SAFE Report contains revised stock assessments for all species except sablefish and demersal
shelf rockfish (DSR). New assessments for these two species are discussed in the final SAFE Report issued in November.
New stock assessment models were used in the assessments for Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and thornyhead rockfish.
Additional information, based on 1993 trawl surveys, was presented for pollock, slope rockfish, Pacific ocean perch
(POP), pelagic shelf rockfish, and the flatfish groups. Details of the assessments can be found in the September 1994
SAFE Report. 

The total ABC amount recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council was a range from 481,090 - 533,690 mt. The
range accounted for the recommended ABC range in the Pacific cod stock. The total TAC amount recommended by the Advisory
Panel (AP) was 326,515 mt. The AP recommended a 1995 TAC equal to the 1995 ABCs, as recommended by the SSC, for pollock,
rex sole, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, DSR, and
thornyhead rockfish. The AP recommendation for a 1995 TAC for Pacific cod was equal to the upper end of the range (103,000
mt) recommended by the SSC. 

The Council considered information in the SAFE Report, recommendations from its SSC and its AP, as well as public testimony.
The Council then accepted the ABCs as recommended by the SSC and, with the exception of ``other rockfish,'' the TACs
as recommended by the AP. 

The Council chose a TAC range for ``other rockfish'' that ranged from the 1994 TAC amount of 2,235 mt to the 1995 ABC amount
of 6,930 mt. This range was recommended to recognize the need for conservative management of this group. However,
NMFS must manage the fisheries based on a single TAC amount, rather than on a range of numbers. NMFS has chosen to propose
a TAC of 6,930 mt, which is the number proposed by the AP and is the ABC that was recommended from the 1994 stock assessment.
Even though this number will be used to establish the 1995 interim TAC until the final specifications are implemented,
no practical difference exists in choosing any number within the Council's recommended TAC range. The hook-and-line
fisheries typically do not harvest other rockfish and the trawl fisheries for rockfish do not open until July 1, by
which time the final specifications will be published. 

NMFS also revises the Council's recommendation for the 1995 flathead sole TAC. The Council approved the AP recommendation
of adopting the 1994 TAC amounts for flathead sole for the 1995 TAC amounts. In the GOA Eastern Regulatory Area, the
1994 TAC amount (3,000 mt) is higher than the Council's recommended 1995 ABC (2,740 mt). To maintain consistency with
the accepted policy of setting TACs lower than or equal to ABC amounts, NMFS is proposing to establish a 1995 TAC of 2,740
mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area. This number is equal to the 1995 ABC recommended by the Plan Team and the SSC and approved
by the Council. Adjustment of the flathead sole TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area changes the total 1995 flathead
sole TAC to 9,740 mt. This also results in a revised ``other species'' TAC amount of 15,535 mt and a revised 1995 total
GOA TAC of 326,242 mt. 

The 1995 ABCs, TACs and interim TACs, as well as the ABC and TAC apportionments, are shown in Table 1.

2. Preliminary Apportionment of Reserves to DAP 



Regulations implementing the FMP require 20 percent of each TAC for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish species, and the
``other species'' category be set aside in reserves for possible apportionment at a later date ( 672.20(a)(2)(ii)).
Consistent with  672.20(a)(2)(iii), NMFS is preliminarily apportioning the 1995 reserves for each of the
four species categories to DAP, anticipating that domestic harvesters and processors have established markets
for these species and should be provided the opportunity to realize revenues from the harvest of the full DAP amounts
so specified. Specifications of DAP shown in Table 1 reflect apportioned reserves. 



3. Preliminary Apportionment of the Sablefish TACs to Users of Hook-and-Line and Trawl Gear 



Under  672.24(c), sablefish TACs for each of the regulatory areas and districts are assigned to hook-and-line
and trawl gear. In the Central and Western Regulatory Areas, 80 percent of the TAC is allocated to hook-and-line gear
and 20 percent is allocated to trawl gear. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, 95 percent of the TAC is assigned to hook-and-line
gear and 5 percent is assigned to trawl gear. The trawl gear allocation in the Eastern Regulatory Area may only be used
as bycatch to support directed fisheries for other target species. Sablefish caught in the GOA with gear other than
hook-and-line or trawl must be treated as prohibited species and may not be retained. Table 2 shows the assignments
of the preliminary 1995 sablefish TACs between hook-and-line and trawl gears.






4. Preliminary Apportionments of Pollock TAC 



In the GOA, pollock is apportioned by area and season. These amounts are further apportioned between inshore and offshore
components. Regulations at  672.20(a)(2)(iv) require that the TAC for pollock in the combined Western/Central
Regulatory Areas (W/C) be apportioned among statistical areas Shumagin (61), Chirikof (62), and Kodiak (63) in proportion
to known distribution of the pollock biomass. This measure was intended to provide spatial distribution of the pollock
harvest as a sea lion protection measure. Each statistical area apportionment is further divided equally into the
four calendar quarters. Within any fishing year, any unharvested amount of any quarterly allowance of pollock TAC
is added in equal proportions to the quarterly allowances of following quarters, resulting in a sum for each quarter
not to exceed 150 percent of the initial quarterly allowance. Similarly, harvests in excess of a quarterly allowance
of TAC are deducted in equal proportions from the remaining quarterly allowances of that fishing year. The Eastern
Regulatory Area proposed TAC of 3,360 mt is not allocated among smaller areas, or quarterly. 

Regulations at  672.20(a)(2)(v)(A) require that the DAP apportionment for pollock in all regulatory areas
and all quarterly allowances thereof be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is apportioned
100 percent of the pollock DAP in each regulatory area after subtraction of amounts that are determined by the Director,
Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to be necessary to support the bycatch needs of the offshore component in
directed fisheries for other groundfish species. At this time, these bycatch amounts are unknown, and will be determined
during the fishing year. The preliminary distribution of pollock within the combined W/C GOA is shown in Table 3, except
that inshore and offshore component apportionments of pollock are not shown.

5. Preliminary Apportionments of Pacific Cod TAC 



Regulations at  672.20(a)(2)(v)(B) require that the DAP apportionment of Pacific cod in all regulatory areas
be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is equal to 90 percent of the Pacific cod TAC
in each regulatory area. Inshore and offshore component allocations of the proposed 103,000 mt TAC for each regulatory
area are shown in Table 4.

6. ``Other Species'' TAC 



The FMP specifies that amounts for the ``other species'' category are calculated as 5 percent of the combined TACs
for target species. The GOA-wide ``other species'' TAC is calculated as 15,535 mt, which is 5 percent of the sum of combined
TACs for the target species. 



7. Preliminary Halibut PSC Mortality Limits 



Under  672.20(f), annual Pacific halibut PSC mortality limits are established for trawl and hook-and-line
gear and may be established for pot gear. 

At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended that, for 1995, NMFS re-establish 1994 PSC limits of 2,000
mt and 750 mt for the trawl and hook-and-line gear fisheries, respectively, with 10 mt of the hook-and-line limit allocated
to the DSR fishery in the Southeast Outside District and the remainder to other hook-and-line gear fisheries. These
interim specifications exempt pot gear from halibut limits for 1994, as proposed by the Council. 

In 1994, NMFS approved a rule that authorizes separate apportionments of the trawl halibut bycatch mortality limit
between trawl fisheries for deep-water and shallow-water species (59 FR 38132, July 27, 1994). These apportionments
are divided seasonally to avoid seasonally high halibut bycatch rates. 

Consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP to reduce halibut bycatches while providing an opportunity to
harvest the groundfish OY, NMFS preliminarily concurs in the Council's 1995 recommendations and assigns 2,000 mt
and 750 mt of halibut PSC mortality limits to trawl and hook-and-line gear, respectively, as interim limits. While
these limits would reduce the harvest quota for commercial halibut fishermen, NMFS has determined that they would
not result in unfair allocation to any particular user group. NMFS recognizes that some halibut bycatch will occur
in the groundfish fishery, but expansion of the Vessel Incentive Program, required modifications to gear, implementation
of the IFQ program, and changes in the season start date for some fisheries are intended to reduce adverse impacts on
halibut fishermen while promoting the opportunity to achieve the OY from the groundfish fishery. 



8. Preliminary Seasonal Allocations of the Halibut PSC Limits 



Under  672.20(f)(2)(iii), NMFS preliminarily allocates seasonal halibut PSC limits based on recommendations
from the Council. The Council recommended the same seasonal allocation of PSC limits for the 1995 fishing year as those
in effect during the 1994 fishing year. The publication of the final 1994 initial groundfish and PSC specifications
(59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) summarizes Council findings with respect to each of the FMP considerations set forth
above. At this time, the Council's findings are unchanged from those set forth for 1994. 

Pacific halibut PSC limits, and apportionments thereof, are presented in Table 5. Regulations specify that any overages
or shortfalls in PSC limits will be accounted for within the 1995 season. 

The Council did not recommend changes in the seasonal apportionments for the hook-and-line gear fisheries from those
specified in 1994; however, NMFS notes that the opening date of the sablefish fishery is scheduled to change from May
18, in 1994, to March 1, in 1995, under the IFQ program. This change and the Council's proposed exemption of the sablefish
fishery from the 1995 PSC limit may prompt the Council to alter its recommendation for seasonal apportionments at
its December 1994 meeting. 

The Pacific halibut PSC limit for hook-and-line gear is allocated to the demersal shelf rockfish (DSR) fishery and
fisheries other than DSR.

Regulations at  672.20(f)(1) authorize apportionments of the trawl halibut PSC limit allowance as bycatch
allowances to a deep-water species complex, comprising sablefish, rockfish, deep-water flatfish, and arrowtooth
flounder, and a shallow-water species complex, comprising pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead
sole, Atka mackerel, and other species. The apportionment for these two complexes is presented in Table 6. 






9. Interim Groundfish Harvest Specifications 



Current regulations at  672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A) require that one-fourth of the proposed TAC (not including the
reserves and the first quarterly allowance of pollock), one-fourth of the inshore and offshore allocations of Pacific
cod in each regulatory area, and one-fourth of the halibut PSC amounts, take effect on January 1 on an interim basis
and remain in effect until superseded by the final 1995 initial specifications published in the Federal Register

 or until harvested. Seasonal apportionments of TACs or PSC limits under provisions of other regulations may supersede
this interim specification. Table 1 shows amounts of proposed specifications of target species and the ``other species''
categories in effect on an interim basis beginning January 1, 1995. 



10. Opening Date of the Directed Fishery for Sablefish for Hook-and-Line Gear 



Under new regulations implementing the IFQ program (50 CFR part 676) in 1995, the opening date of the sablefish fishery
is March 1. 



11. Closures to Directed Fishing 



Under  672.20(c)(2)(ii), if the Regional Director determines that the amount of a target species or ``other
species'' category apportioned to a fishery, or with respect to Pacific cod, to an allocation to the inshore or offshore
component, is likely to be reached, the Regional Director may establish a directed fishing allowance for that species
or species group. In establishing a directed fishing allowance, the Regional Director shall consider the amount
of that species group or allocation of Pacific cod to the inshore or offshore component that will be taken as incidental
catch in directed fishing for other species in the same regulatory area or district. If the Regional Director establishes
a directed fishing allowance, and that allowance is or will be reached before the end of the fishing year, NMFS will
prohibit directed fishing for that species or species group in the specified regulatory area or district. 

The Regional Director has determined that interim amounts of groundfish specified by this preliminary specification
(Table 1) for species or species groups identified in Table 7 will be necessary as incidental catch to support anticipated
groundfish fisheries prior to the time that final specifications of groundfish are in effect for the 1995 fishing
year. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for those target species, gears, and components listed in
Table 7 to prevent exceeding the interim amounts of groundfish TACs specified. These closures will be in effect during
the period that the appropriate interim specifications of groundfish TACs are in effect. During these closures,
applicable directed fishing standards may be found at  672.20(g). Additional closures and restrictions may
be found in existing regulations at 50 CFR part 672.

After consideration of public comments and additional scientific information presented at its December 1994 meeting,
the Council may recommend other closures to directed fishing. Additionally, NMFS may implement other closures at
the time the final 1995 initial specifications of groundfish TACs are implemented, or during the 1995 fishing year
as necessary for effective management.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Education issues final standards, criteria, and procedures governing the alternative repayment
and income contingent repayment (ICR) plans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program for
the academic year beginning July 1, 1994. 




These standards, criteria, and procedures apply to loans under the Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program, the
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program, the Federal Direct PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation
Loan Program, collectively referred to as the Direct Loan Program.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). 

See

 Subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66). Under the Direct Loan Program,
loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government rather than through private
lenders. Borrowers under the Direct Loan Program are provided a range of repayment options, including an ICR plan.




The HEA directs the Secretary to consult with members of the higher education community and to publish a notice of standards,
criteria, and procedures for the program's first year in lieu of issuing regulations using the Department's usual
procedures. The Secretary's representatives have consulted with representatives of students, colleges, universities,
proprietary schools, and educational associations, as well as representatives of the financial aid community,
in developing this notice. In particular, the Secretary's representatives have had extensive consultations with
the other members of the Direct Student Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee established
to develop proposed regulations for the second and subsequent years of the program. See the Secretary's announcement
of his intention to establish this Committee at 58 FR 68619 (December 28, 1993). The Secretary, in consultation with
the above-discussed members of the higher education community, has determined that this notice is reasonable and
necessary to the successful implementation of the first year of the program. 

This notice modifies the provisions of the ICR plan and the alternative repayment plan for the 1994-95 academic
year. 



I. Background 



On July 1, 1994, the Secretary published a final regulation governing the Direct Loan Program for the 1994-95
academic year. That regulation prescribes the formula used to determine the repayment amounts under the ICR plan
for borrowers whose loans enter repayment during the 1994-95 academic year. 

On August 18, 1994, the same formula was published in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking relating to the 1995-96
and subsequent years of the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary received 98 comments on that NPRM, most of which include
discussion of the ICR plan. In response to those comments, the Secretary made several changes to the ICR plan for the
1995-96 and subsequent academic years. The changes provide borrowers with better repayment terms than are
currently available for the 1994-95 academic year. For example, the limit on the amount of interest that will
be capitalized (or added to principal) was reduced from 50 percent of the original principal to 10 percent of the original
principal, thereby reducing the cost of borrowing significantly for some borrowers whose monthly payments are lower
than the amount of interest accrued. The new ICR formula also 
lowers the required monthly payment for many borrowers who have lower incomes.

<TEXT>
 

This notice extends the revised ICR formula and its benefits, including the reduced level of capitalization, to borrowers
whose loans enter repayment in the 1994-95 academic year. This notice also reduces the level of capitalization
of interest on loans repaid under the alternative repayment plan for borrowers whose loans enter repayment in the
1994-95 academic year. Finally, this notice establishes a 30-year maximum repayment period for the alternative
repayment plan. 

The Secretary believes that it is desirable for all Direct Loan borrowers who choose the ICR plan to be subject to the
same formula during the first years of this new program. As of this date, no Direct Loan borrowers have entered repayment
under the ICR formula published on July 1, 1994, but some Direct Loan borrowers will enter income contingent repayment
before the 1994-95 academic year is over. This notice provides that the revised ICR plan will apply to those borrowers.


The Secretary believes that applying one formula to all borrowers allows the Secretary to publish materials that
clearly explain the repayment options to borrowers without having to discuss multiple formulas. Furthermore, having
a single formula during the initial years of this program simplifies the administration of the program for schools
and promotes a clear understanding of the repayment provisions. 



II. Summary of Contents 



Section 685.208 Repayment Plans




The Secretary has established the maximum repayment period allowable under the alternative repayment plan at 30
years. Further, under the alternative plan, interest that accrues and is not paid will be capitalized annually until
the outstanding principal is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. 



Section 685.209 Income Contingent Repayment Plan



The Secretary has significantly modified the income contingent repayment (ICR) plan provisions. The Secretary
is lowering the limit on interest capitalization that may occur when interest accrues, but is not paid, from 50 percent
greater than the original principal amount to 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. Also, monthly
payments will be limited to 20 percent of discretionary income (AGI minus the poverty level appropriate to the family
size). This change eliminates the need for the previous family size offset of $7 and provides a new cap on the amount
of income assessed. The Secretary is including years of repayment under the 10-year standard repayment plan and the
12-year extended repayment plan as years eligible for determining the 25-year period for loan forgiveness. The monthly
repayment amount below which no payment is required under the formula calculation is $15. Under the 12-year standard
amortization cap, the minimum payment is $15 (that is, a borrower must pay at least $15 each month). The 12-year standard
amortization cap calculation has been modified to provide for the recalculation of the cap following periods of negative
amortization because these periods result in an increase in the outstanding loan balance. The payback rate for married
borrowers paying jointly under ICR will be calculated on the outstanding debt at the time the borrowers are approved
for joint repayment. For borrowers repaying jointly, payments will be applied to interest on both accounts prior
to principal reduction in either. 

Section 685.209 (ICR plan) contains provisions governing the two monthly payment calculations, namely the formula
amount and the capped amount, available for repayment of Direct Loans under the ICR plan. Borrowers may choose to repay
either the formula amount or the capped amount. (See Appendix A for detailed examples illustrating, for single borrowers
and for married borrowers who are repaying under the ICR plan, the calculations of the formula and capped monthly repayment
amounts.) 



Formula Amount



Calculation of the ICR formula monthly payment amount is described in paragraph (b) of this section. In general, the
borrower's annual repayment obligation is the borrower's AGI multiplied by a ``payback rate'' that is based on the
borrower's debt. The monthly payment is the annual repayment obligation divided by 12. The ``payback rate'' varies
from four to 15 percent, calculated as described in paragraph (b)(2). The payment amount cannot exceed 20 percent
of discretionary income (AGI minus the annual poverty level appropriate to the family size) divided by 12. If the calculated
monthly payment is less than $15, the borrower is not required to make a payment. When a borrower is not required to make
a payment, interest on the principal accrues and will be capitalized until the limitation on capitalization is reached.




Capped Amount



Calculation of the capped monthly payment amount is described in paragraph (c), and equals the monthly amount the
borrower would repay over 12 years using standard amortization schedules. If the formula amount exceeds the capped
amount, the borrower may choose to pay the capped amount. If the borrower chooses to pay the capped amount, the borrower's
repayment period may be longer than if the borrower chooses to pay the higher formula amount. 




Joint Repayment By Married Borrowers



This section includes provisions for joint income contingent repayment of Direct Loans by married borrowers. Negative
amortization is minimized by attributing joint repayments first to the interest due on each spouse's account and
then to principal. A step-by-step calculation of a combined repayment amount is included as Example 2 in Appendix
A. 




Repayment Period



Provisions governing the repayment period under ICR are contained in paragraph (d)(2). The maximum period is 25 years,
excluding periods of authorized deferment and forbearance under   685.204 and 685.205, respectively,
and periods in which the borrower made payments under a repayment plan other than the 10-year standard or 12-year extended
plans. The Secretary believes the exclusion of repayment periods under all other extended and graduated plans is
needed to prevent potential borrower repayment abuses.

<TEXT>
 

If a borrower repays more than one loan under ICR and the loans enter repayment at different times, a separate repayment
period for each loan begins when the loan enters repayment. This approach ensures that no loan will be repaid under
ICR for more than 25 years. If loans enter repayment at the same time, a single repayment period applies. 
To encourage borrowers to begin repaying their loans and to limit negative amortization at the beginning of the repayment
period, a borrower must make monthly payments of accrued interest until the Secretary calculates the borrower's
monthly payment on the basis of the borrower's income. A borrower who is unable to make monthly payments of accrued
interest or is unable to qualify for a deferment under  685.204, may request forbearance under  685.205.



Limit on Capitalization of Interest


The Secretary believes a limit on the amount of interest that is added to principal (the capitalization of interest)
is desirable to prevent an excessive increase in a borrower's debt burden when the borrower's income is insufficient
to cover accruing interest. Paragraph (d)(3) permits capitalization of unpaid interest until the outstanding principal
amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount, a decrease from the 50 percent proposed in the 
NPRM. Thereafter, unpaid interest accrues but is not capitalized. 


Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information


In order to repay a Direct Loan under ICR, a borrower must consent, on a form provided by the Secretary, to the disclosure
of certain tax return information by the Internal Revenue Service to agents of the Secretary for purposes of calculating
a monthly repayment amount and servicing and collecting a loan. The information subject to disclosure is taxpayer
identity information as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6103(b)(6) (including such information as name, address, and social
security number), tax filing status, and AGI. Paragraph (d)(5) describes the procedures for providing written consent
and requires that consent be provided for a period of five years. If a borrower selects ICR but fails to provide or renew
consent, or withdraws consent without selecting a different repayment plan, the Secretary designates the 10-year
standard repayment plan for the borrower. 


III. Waiver of Rulemaking 


In accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested
parties an opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, Pub. L. 103-66 permits the Secretary to
publish a notice in lieu of regulations for the first year of the Direct Loan Program and exempts the contents of the
notice from the rulemaking requirements of section 431 of the General Education Provisions Act (recently revised
and renumbered by Pub. L. 103-382 as section 437). In developing this notice, the Secretary's representatives
have consulted extensively with the other members of the Direct Student Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking
Advisory Committee established to develop proposed regulations for the second and subsequent years of the program,
and has taken into consideration the public comments submitted in response to the Secretary's invitation in the August
18, 1994 Direct Loan NPRM. The timely implementation of the ICR plan for borrowers entering repayment in academic
year 1994-1995 does not permit the solicitation of further public comment. A public comment period would seriously
delay operation of the Direct Loan Program and would prevent borrowers entering repayment during the first year of
the program from receiving the same benefits as borrowers who enter repayment in the second year of the program. Therefore,
the Secretary finds that solicitation of public comments is impracticable and contrary to the public interest under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). For the same reasons, the Secretary has decided to waive the 30-day delayed effective date under
5 U.S.C. 553(d).

. (1) The Secretary may provide an alternative repayment plan for a borrower who demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction
that the terms and conditions of the repayment plans specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section are not
adequate to accommodate the borrower's exceptional circumstances. 
(2) The Secretary may require a borrower to provide evidence of the borrower's exceptional circumstances before
permitting the borrower to repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan. 
(3) If the Secretary agrees to permit a borrower to repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan, the Secretary
notifies the borrower in writing of the terms of the plan. After the borrower receives notification of the terms of
the plan, the borrower may accept the plan or choose another repayment plan. 
(4) A borrower shall repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan within 30 years of the date the loan entered repayment,
not including periods of deferment and forbearance.

(5) If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment under an alternative repayment plan is less than the accrued interest
on the loan, the unpaid interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than
the original principal amount. After the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal
amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. For purposes of this paragraph, the original principal
amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.

3. Section 685.209 is revised to read as follows: 


 685.209 

Income contingent repayment plan. 


(a) 

General

. (1) Under the income contingent repayment plan described in  685.208(f), a borrower may choose to repay under
the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section or may choose to have payments capped as described in paragraph
(c) of this section. The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section is called the ``formula amount,'' and
the amount calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is called the ``capped amount.'' 
(2) Borrowers may choose to repay either the formula amount or the capped amount when they enter repayment and may change
between the options one time each year. 
(3) The Secretary may determine that special circumstances, such as a loss of employment by the borrower or the borrower's
spouse, warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment obligations. 
(4) Married borrowers may repay their loans jointly if they meet the following requirements: 
(i) The spouses have both chosen either the formula amount or the capped amount. 
(ii) The spouses filed a joint Federal income tax return for the most recent year for which the Secretary has obtained
income information. 
(iii) The spouses submit a written request to the Secretary that includes their names and social security numbers.

(5) Examples of the calculation of monthly repayment amounts and tables that shows monthly repayment amounts for
borrowers at various income and debt levels are included in appendix A to this part. 
(b) 

Formula amount

. (1) 

General

. (i) If a borrower chooses to pay the formula amount under the income contingent repayment plan, the borrower generally
makes monthly payments that are calculated using a percentage of the borrower's Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) called
the ``payback rate.'' 
(ii) A borrower's monthly payment is equal to the borrower's AGI multiplied by the payback rate, divided by 12 months.
However, a borrower's monthly payment is never larger than 20 percent of the borrower's discretionary income as defined
in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, divided by 12 months. Additionally, if the monthly repayment amount is
less than $15, the borrower is not required to make a payment. 

(iii) For purposes of this section, discretionary income is defined as a borrower's AGI minus the amount of the ``HHS
Poverty Guideline for all States (except Alaska and Hawaii) and the District of Columbia'' as published by the United
States Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis.

1

 If a borrower provides documentation acceptable to the Secretary that the borrower has more than one person in the
borrower's family, the Secretary applies the HHS Poverty Guideline for the borrower's family size. 




(2) 

Payback rate. 

(i) A borrower's payback rate is based upon the borrower's Direct Loan debt when the borrower's first loan enters repayment
and does not change unless the borrower obtains another Direct Loan or the borrower and the borrower's spouse obtain
approval to repay their loans jointly under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If the borrower obtains another Direct
Loan, a new payback rate for all of the borrower's Direct Loans is calculated on the basis of the combined amounts of
the loans when the last loan enters repayment. If the borrower and the borrower's spouse repay the loans jointly, the
provisions under paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply. 

(ii) If the total amount of a borrower's Direct Loans is less than or equal to $1,000, the payback rate is four percent.
If the total amount of a borrower's Direct Loans is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is four percent plus an additional
percent that begins at zero and increases at a rate of 0.2 percent for each additional $1,000 borrowed up to a maximum
payback rate of 15 percent. 
(iii) More specifically, if the total amount of a borrower's Direct Loans is greater than $1,000, the payback rate
is the lesser of 0.15 or the following: 0.04 + (debt ^ 1,000) (0.000002). 
(3) 

Exception for certain married borrowers

. (i) The combined monthly payment amount for married borrowers who repay their loans jointly under paragraph (a)(4)
of this section and who repay the formula amount is the total of the individual monthly payment amounts for each borrower
calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. 
(ii) The payback rate for each borrower is calculated separately on the basis of the amount of the outstanding debt
on the borrower's Direct Loans at the time the borrower enters into joint repayment with the borrower's spouse. For
purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary assumes that the AGI for each borrower is proportionate to the relative
size of the borrower's individual debt. 
(iii) For purposes of determining whether a borrower's payment amount is larger than 20 percent of the borrower's
discretionary income under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), a portion of the appropriate HHS Poverty Guideline for the borrowers'
family size 

is applied to each borrower in proportion to the relative size of the individual borrower's debts.

(iv) If the combined monthly repayment amount is less than $15, the borrowers are not required to make a payment. 


(v) The amount of a borrower's individual monthly payment is applied to the borrower's debt, except that the Secretary
credits joint payments toward interest accrued on any loan before any payment is credited to principal. 

(c) 

Capped amount. 

(1) 

General. 

If a borrower's monthly payments calculated under the formula amount as determined in paragraph (b) of this section
are greater than the capped amount calculated under paragraph (c)(2), the borrower may choose to repay the capped
amount. 

(2) 

Calculation of the capped amount. 

(i) The capped amount is the amount that a borrower would repay monthly over 12 years using standard amortization or
$15, whichever is greater. 

(ii) The amount of the cap is recalculated on an annual basis to include changes in the variable rate. 

(iii) After periods in which a borrower makes payments that are less than interest accrued on the loan, the amount of
the cap is recalculated. If the new cap is larger than the existing cap, the new cap is applied. If the new cap is smaller
than or equal to the existing cap, the existing cap is applied. 

(3) 

Exception to the calculation of the capped amount for certain married borrowers. 

The capped amount for married borrowers who repay jointly under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is the same amount
as calculated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section except that the amount is based on the combined Direct Loan debt
of the borrowers. 

(d) 

Other features of the income contingent repayment plan. 

(1) 

Alternative documentation of income. 

If a borrower's AGI is not available or if, in the Secretary's opinion, the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably
reflect the borrower's current income, the Secretary may use other documentation of income provided by the borrower
to calculate the borrower's monthly repayment amount. 

(2) 

Repayment period. 

(i) The maximum repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan is 25 years. 

(ii) The repayment period includes periods in which the borrower makes payments under the standard repayment plan
and under extended repayment plans in which payments are based on a repayment period that is up to 12 years. The repayment
period does not include periods in which the borrower makes payments under the graduated and alternative repayment
plans or periods of authorized deferment or forbearance. The repayment period also does not include periods in which
the borrower makes payments under an extended repayment plan in which payments are based on a repayment period that
is longer than 12 years. 

(iii) If a borrower repays more than one loan under the income contingent repayment plan, a separate repayment period
for each loan begins when that loan enters repayment. 

(iv) If a borrower has not repaid a loan in full at the end of the 25-year repayment period under the income contingent
repayment plan, the Secretary cancels the unpaid portion of the loan. 

(v) At the beginning of the repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan, a borrower shall make monthly
payments of the amount of interest that accrues on the borrower's Direct Loans until the Secretary calculates the
borrower's monthly repayment amount on the basis of the borrower's income. 

(3) 

Limitation on capitalization of interest. 

If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment is less than the accrued interest, the unpaid interest is capitalized
until the outstanding principal amount is ten percent greater than the original principal amount. After the outstanding
principal amount is ten percent greater than the original amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized.
For purposes of this paragraph, the original amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.


(4) 

Notification of terms and conditions. 

When a borrower elects or is required by the Secretary to repay a loan under the income contingent repayment plan, the
Secretary notifies the borrower of the terms and conditions of the plan, including_

(i) That the Internal Revenue Service will disclose certain tax return information to the Secretary or the Secretary's
agents; and 

(ii) That if the borrower believes that special circumstances warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment
obligations, as described in  685.209(a)(3), the borrower may contact the Secretary and obtain the Secretary's
determination as to whether an adjustment is appropriate. 

(5) 

Consent to disclosure of tax return information. 

(i) A borrower shall provide written consent to the disclosure of certain tax return information by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) to agents of the Secretary for purposes of calculating a monthly repayment amount and servicing and
collecting a loan under the income contingent repayment plan. The borrower shall provide consent by signing a consent
form, developed consistent with 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1 and provided to the borrower by the Secretary, and shall return
the signed form to the Secretary. 

(ii) The borrower shall consent to disclosure of the borrower's taxpayer identity information as defined in 26 U.S.C.
6103(b)(6), tax filing status, and AGI. 

(iii) The borrower shall provide consent for a period of five years from the date the borrower signs the consent form.
The Secretary provides the borrower a new consent form before that period expires. The IRS does not disclose tax return
information after the IRS has processed a borrower's withdrawal of consent. 

(iv) The Secretary designates the standard repayment plan for a borrower who selects the income contingent repayment
plan but_

(A) Fails to provide the required written consent; 

(B) Fails to renew written consent upon the expiration of the five-year period for consent; or 

(C) Withdraws consent and does not select another repayment plan. 

(v) If a borrower defaults and the Secretary designates the income contingent repayment plan for the borrower but
the borrower fails to provide the required written consent, the Secretary mails a notice to the borrower establishing
a repayment schedule for the borrower.

APPENDIX A_INCOME CONTINGENT REPAYMENT 



Examples of the Calculation of Monthly Repayment Amounts 





Example 1. 

A single borrower with $12,500 of Direct Loans and an Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of $25,000. 






Step 1: 

Calculate the payback rate. Because the borrower's debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on
the basis of the formula in  685.209(b)(2)(iii), as follows: 




 Subtract $1,000 from the total amount of the borrower's Direct Loans: ($12,500^$1,000=$11,500). 




 Multiply the result by 0.000002: ($11,500 x 0.000002=0.023).

<DOCNO> FR941222-0-00127 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Add the result to 0.04: (0.04+0.023=0.063). 




 The result is the payback rate. 






Step 2: 

Compare the calculated payback rate (0.063) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated rate is less
than the maximum rate, the borrower's payback rate is 0.063. 






Step 3: 

Calculate the annual repayment amount by multiplying the borrower's AGI by the payback rate: ($25,000 x 0.063=$1,575).







Step 4: 

Calculate the monthly repayment amount by dividing the annual repayment amount by 12 months: ($1,575
12=$131.25). 






Step 5: 

Calculate the borrower's discretionary income (AGI minus HHS Poverty Guideline for a family of one): ($25,000^$7,360=$17,640).







Step 6: 

Multiply the borrower's discretionary income ($17,640) by 20 percent: ($17,640 x .2=3,528). 






Step 7: 

Divide the amount calculated in Step 6 by 12 months: ($3,528
12=$294). 






Step 8: 

Compare the amount calculated in Step 4 ($131.25) with the amount calculated in Step 7 ($294). The lower amount is the
formula amount. The formula amount is $131.25. The borrower's monthly payment under the formula amount would be $131.25.







Step 9: 

Compare the monthly formula amount ($131.25) to the $15 floor repayment amount. Because the formula amount is 
greater than the $15 floor, the borrower's monthly formula amount is $131.25. 



Step 10: 

Compare the formula amount calculated in Step 9 ($131.25) to the capped amount, which is the monthly amount the borrower
would repay under a 12-year standard amortization schedule. If the interest rate is seven percent, the 12-year standard
amortization amount is approximately $10.28 for every $1,000 of debt. In this example, since the borrower has $12,500
in debt, the capped amount is approximately $128.50 ($10.28 x 12.5). Because the formula amount ($131.25)
exceeds the capped amount ($128.50), the capped amount is the minimum monthly repayment. The borrower has the option
of paying the formula amount (or any higher amount). 



Example 2. 

Married borrowers both repaying under the ICR plan with a combined Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of $30,000. The husband
has $5,000 of Direct Loans. The wife has $15,000 of Direct Loans. The couple has two children. 



Step 1: 

Calculate the husband's payback rate. Because his debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on the
basis of the formula in  685.209(b)(2)(
