<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking by cross-reference to temporary regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the IRS is issuing temporary regulations relating to the income tax withholding requirement on distributions of
profits from certain gaming activities made to members of Indian tribes under section 3402(r) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986. The text of those temporary regulations also serves as the text of these proposed regulations. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Temporary regulations in the Rules and Regulations portion of this issue of the 

Federal Register

 amend the Employment Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 31) relating to section 3402(r). The temporary regulations contain
rules relating to the income tax withholding requirement on distributions of profits from certain gaming activities
made to members of Indian tribes under section 3402(r). 

The text of those temporary regulations also serves as the text of these proposed regulations. The preamble to the
temporary regulations explains these proposed regulations. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 



Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing 



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public
inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely submits written
comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will be published in
the 

Federal Register

. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of the regulations is Rebecca Wilson, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits
and Exempt Organizations). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their
development. 



List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 31 



Employment taxes, Income taxes, Penalties, Pensions, Railroad retirement, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,
Social security, Unemployment compensation. 



Proposed Amendments to the Regulations 



Accordingly, 26 CFR part 31 is proposed to be amended as follows: 



PART 31_EMPLOYMENT TAXES AND COLLECTION OF INCOME TAX AT SOURCE 





Paragraph 1. 

The authority citation for part 31 is amended by adding an entry in numerical order to read as follows: 






Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * Section 31.3402(r)-1 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 3402(r). * * * 






Par. 2. 

Section 31.3402(r)-1 is added to read as follows: 


 31.3402(r)-1 

Withholding on distributions of Indian gaming profits to tribal members. 



[The text of this proposed section is the same as the text of  31.3402(r)-1T published elsewhere in this

Time for Furnishing Wage Statements on Termination of Employer's Operations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains proposed regulations under sections 6051 and 6071 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 concerning
the time for furnishing wage statements to both employees and the Social Security Administration upon the termination
of an employer's operations. These proposed regulations will affect employers and their employees in the year the
employer ceases to pay wages. These regulations will improve the wage reconciliation process between the Social
Security Administration and the IRS.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



This document contains amendments to the Employment Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 31) under sections 6051 and 6071
of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The proposed regulations are to be issued under the authority of sections 6051,
6071 and 7805. 



Explanation of Provisions 



The proposed regulations improve the wage reconciliation process between the Social Security Administration (SSA)
and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by generally requiring an employer that is required to file a final Form 941,
Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, to file Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, and W-3, Transmittal
of Wage and Tax Statements, with SSA and to furnish Form W-2 to the employees at the same time the employer is required
to file the final Form 941. 

Prior to 1978, employers had submitted quarterly tax returns to the IRS listing both the aggregate wages and taxes
for all employees (Form 941) and each employee's name and Social Security number, showing the amount of wages paid
to the employee for that quarter (Schedule A of Form 941 or Form 941A). The IRS forwarded Form 941A to SSA, which used
it to post earnings to individual Social Security records. 

In order to minimize the burden on employers, Congress changed the requirement for submission of detailed wage statements
from a quarterly to an annual basis, effective in 1978. As a result, under the current system, an employer submits quarterly
tax returns (Forms 941) to the IRS listing the aggregate wages and taxes of all of its employees. Annual information
returns are submitted to SSA listing the wages of each individual employee (Forms W-2, accompanied by Forms

W-3 listing aggregate annual wages of all employees). A reconciliation problem arises when the aggregate wages
on the annual reports to the SSA do not match the aggregate wages on the four quarterly reports submitted to the IRS.
Where the wages reported to the IRS exceed the wages reported to SSA, this indicates a possible underreporting of social
security wages to SSA. 

One source of these discrepancies is the termination by employers of their business operations. In some instances,
employers that have gone out of business well before the due date for the annual filing of Form W-2 have failed
to file Forms W-2 with SSA as required. These failures have occurred even though the employer might have filed
one or more quarterly Forms 941 with the IRS during the year. In these cases, the failure to receive the Forms W-2
means SSA is unable to credit wages to the social security accounts of affected employees. This problem can be eliminated
by requiring employers that terminate business operations to file Forms W-2 and W-3 at the time they are
required to file the final Form 941. 

Generally, under  31.6071(a)-1(a)(1) of the existing regulations, the Form 941 is due on or before the
last day of the first calendar month following the period (generally a calendar quarter) for which it is made. Thus,
the Form 941 is generally due on or before April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. There is a ten-day extension
if the employer timely deposited the taxes due for the quarter. Section 31.6011(a)-6(a)(1) of the existing
regulations requires an employer that ceases to pay wages in a quarter to mark and file the Form 941 for that quarter
as a final return. The proposed regulations require an employer that is required to file a final Form 941 to provide
Forms W-2 to the employees and Forms W-2 and 
W-3 to SSA at the same time that the employer is required to file the final Form 941. 

Different time frames apply to monthly Form 941 filers. Under  31.6071(a)-1(a)(2) of the existing regulations,
if the district director notifies an employer that it is required to make monthly returns on Form 941 in lieu of quarterly
returns, the Form 941 is due on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month following the period (generally a calendar
month) for which it is made. For employers that are required to file Form 941 monthly, requiring the filing of the Forms
W-2 at the same time as the final Form 941 might be unduly burdensome. Thus, the proposed regulations would not
require a monthly filer to provide Forms W-2 to the employees until the end of the calendar month in which the final
Form 941 is due, rather than by the fifteenth day of that month. The proposed regulations leave in place the provisions
of  31.6071(a)-1(a)(3) of the existing regulations requiring a monthly filer that files a final Form
941 to furnish Forms W-2 and W-3 to SSA on or before the last day of the second calendar month following the
period for which the final Form 941 is due.

Under  31.6051-1(d)(1) of the existing regulations, applicable to both quarterly and monthly Form 941
filers, if an individual's employment is terminated before the end of a calendar year, the employer may furnish Form
W-2 to the employee at any time after termination but no later than January 31 of the next year. If the terminated
employee requests a Form W-2, and if there is no reasonable expectation on the part of either the employer or the
employee of further employment during the calendar year, the employer must furnish Form W-2 to the employee
by the later of 30 days after the employee made the request or 30 days after the last payment of wages. The proposed regulation
has no effect on the rights of terminated employees to require the employer to furnish Form W-2 within this time
frame. 

In Revenue Procedure 84-77, 1984-2 C.B. 753, the IRS provided procedures for preparing and filing certain
forms, including Form 941, Form W-2 and Form W-3, when a successor employer acquires substantially all
of the property (1) used in a trade or business of a predecessor employer, or (2) used in a separate unit of a trade or business
of a predecessor, and in connection with, or immediately after the acquisition (but during the same calendar year)
the successor employs individuals who were employed in the trade or business of the predecessor immediately prior
to the acquisition. This proposed regulation would have the effect of modifying the time frame for the standard procedure
in section 4.01 of the Revenue Procedure. Except for this change, the proposed regulation would not affect the continuing
validity of the Revenue Procedure. 

The proposed regulation applies to employers who file Form 941 on a monthly or quarterly basis, including railroad
employers. It does not apply to employers with respect to their agricultural employees (in those cases, employers
file on an annual basis on Form 943). Nor does it apply to employers with respect to their domestic employees (in those
cases, employers file on an annual basis beginning in 1995). 

These regulations are effective upon the date of publication of these regulations in final form in the 

Federal Register

. However, these regulations shall apply only to employers that cease the payment of wages after the close of the calendar
quarter in which the date of publication occurs. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 



Comments and Public Hearing 



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public
inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person who timely submits written
comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will be published in
the 

Federal Register

. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Jean Whalen Casey, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits
and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their
development.

<USDEPT>POSTAL RATE COMMISSION</USDEPT>










Express Mail Market Response Rate Requests: Rules of Practice and Procedure 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Rate Commission.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a petition filed by the Postal Service, the Postal Rate 
Commission proposes to re-enact its rules of practice allowing expedited consideration of 
Express Mail market response rate requests. These rules expired recently pursuant to a 
sunset provision. Re-enactment will insure the continued existence of a flexible 
ratemaking mechanism for consideration of changes in Express Mail rates between 
omnibus rate cases when required by market conditions. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 15, 1994, the Postal Service filed a petition for institution of a 
rulemaking to re-enact Commission rules of practice and procedure on Postal Service 
requests for changes in Express Mail rates in response to market conditions. These rules 
were the outcome of Docket No. RM88-2, Express Mail Rulemaking. That rulemaking, 
like this one, was instituted at the Service's request. The rules that were finally issued 
differed from those initially proposed by the Service. They are codified at 39 CFR 
3001.57-3001.57c. They took effect August 16, 1989. At that time, they were identified 
as experimental rules and issued subject to a five-year sunset provision. That period has 
expired. 




As the Service notes in its recent petition, the original impetus for adoption of 
these rules was a period of intense price competition in the expedited (overnight) 
delivery market. Postal Service Petition at 2. Prior to their adoption, rates for Express 
Mail service could be set only by filing a formal request under rule 54. Rule 54 requires 
detailed information on costs, revenues, elasticities of demand and entails numerous 
procedural stages. 

See 

39 CFR 3001.54. Fulfillment of these requirements generally 
means that decisions on rate change requests require the full ten months allowed by the 
statute. This effectively forecloses prompt responses to frequent price changes. 

See generally 

54 FR 33681 (August 16, 1989). As rapid price changes were the hallmark of 
expedited delivery competition in the early-to-mid 1980s, it was believed that a flexible 
ratemaking mechanism would allow the Postal Service to respond more effectively to 
market conditions. 

In support of its petition for re-enactment, the Postal Service acknowledges that it 
has never invoked the market response rules. However, it asserts several reasons for 
their retention. One is that the overnight delivery market remains competitive, primarily 
on price. Another is Express Mail's emergence as a low-cost alternative for household 
users and small- and medium-volume businesses not eligible for discounts from other 
carriers' published rates. A third is preservation of Express Mail's contribution to 
institutional costs. 

The Commission's initial review of the Service's petition leads it to agree that the 
Express Mail market response rules should be retained. Interested parties are invited to 
comment on the appropriateness of this action. The Commission directs W. Gail 
Willette, Acting Director of the Office of the Consumer Advocate, to participate to the 
extent necessary to fulfill her responsibilities under 39 CFR 3002.7 and part 3002, Appendix A. 



II. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the PRC hereby 
certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not expected to have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory 
flexibility analysis is not required. 



III. List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 3001



Administrative practice and procedure, Postal Service.



1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 3001 continues to read as follows:







Authority:

 39 U.S.C.  404(b), 3603, 3622-3624, 3661, 3662.





2. Sections 3001.57 through 3001.57c are added to Subpart B to read as follows:



 3001.57

Market response rate requests for Express Mail service_purpose and duration of rules. 



(a) This section and   3001.57a through 3001.57c only apply in cases in which 
the Postal Service requests an expedited recommended decision pursuant to section 3622 
of the Postal Reorganization Act on changes in rates and fees for Express Mail service, 
where the proposed changes are intended to respond to a change in the market for 
expedited delivery services for the purpose of minimizing the loss of Express Mail 
contribution to institutional costs recommended in the most recent omnibus rate case. 
These rules set forth the requirements for filing data in support of such rate proposals 
and for providing notice of such requests, and establish an expedited procedural schedule 
for evaluating Market Response Rate Requests. These rules may not be used when the 
Postal Service is requesting changes in Express Mail rates as part of an omnibus rate 
case. Further explanation concerning these rules can be found at 54 FR 11394-413 
(March 20, 1989), 54 FR 251342-42 (June 13, 1989) and PRC Order No. 836.

(b) This section and   3001.57a through 3001.57c are initially to be effective for the 
limited period of five years from the date of their adoption by the Commission. During 
that period the Commission will continue to analyze the need for these rules to enable 
the Postal Service to respond to changes in the market for expedited delivery services, 
and the impact of these procedures on Postal Service proposals. These rules will cease 
to be effective at the end of this period unless they have been reissued by the 
Commission following a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in the 

Federal 
Register 

which provides an appropriate opportunity for public comments. 



 3001.57a

Market Response Rate Requests_data filing requirements. 



(a) Each formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 
3001.57c shall be accompanied by such information and data as are necessary to inform 
the Commission and the parties of the nature and expected impact of the change in rates 
proposed. Except for good cause shown, the information specified in paragraphs (c) 
through (i) of this section shall also be provided with each request. 

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, the information 
required by  3001.54 (b) through (r) must be filed only for those subclasses 
and services for which the Postal Service requests a change in rates or fees. Test period 
volume, cost, and revenue estimates presented in satisfaction of rule 57a shall be for four 
postal quarters beginning after the filing date of the request. The cost roll-forward may 
be developed by extending the cost forecasting model used in the last omnibus rate case 
(utilizing available actual data). Volume and revenue estimates required by these rules 
shall utilize, to the extent practicable, the factors identified in rule 54 (j)(6), and must be 
fully explained, with all available supporting documentation supplied, but they need not 
be econometrically derived. 

(c) Every formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 
3001.57c shall contain an explanation of why the change proposed by the Postal Service 
is a reasonable response to the change in the market for expedited delivery services to 
which it is intended to respond. 

(d) Every formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 
3001.57c shall be accompanied by the then effective Domestic Mail Classification 
Schedule sections which would have to be altered in order to implement the changes 
proposed by the Postal Service, and, arranged in a legislative format, the text of the 
replacement Domestic Mail Classification Schedule sections the Postal Service proposes. 

(e) In addition to the required test period cost estimates, every formal request 
made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by 
a statement of the attributable costs by segment and component for Express Mail service 
determined in accordance with the attributable cost methodology adopted by the Commission in the most recent omnibus
rate case, for the base year used in that case, and for 
each fiscal year thereafter for which cost data is available. If the Postal Service believes 
that an adjustment to that methodology is warranted it may also provide costs using 
alternative methodologies as long as a full rationale for the proposed changes is 
provided. 

(f) Each formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 
3001.57c shall include a description of all operational changes, occurring since the most 
recent omnibus rate case, having an important impact on the attributable cost of Express 
Mail. Postal Service shall include an analysis and estimate of the cost impact of each 
such operational change. 

(g) Every formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 
3001.57c shall be accompanied by a statement of the actual Express Mail revenues of the 
Postal Service from the then effective Express Mail rates and fees for the most recent 
four quarters for which information is available. 

(h) Each formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 
3001.57c shall be accompanied by a complete description of the change in the market for 
expedited delivery services to which the Postal Service proposal is in response, a 
statement of when that change took place, the Postal Service's analysis of the anticipated 
impact of that change on the market, and a description of characteristics and needs of 
customers and market segments affected by this change which the proposed Express Mail 
rates are designed to satisfy. 

(i) Each formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 
3001.57c shall include estimates, on a quarterly basis, of test period volumes, revenues, 
and attributable costs determined in accordance with the attributable cost methodology 
adopted by the Commission in the most recent omnibus rate case for each Express Mail 
service for which rate changes are proposed assuming: 

(1) Rates remain at their existing levels, and 

(2) Rates are changed after 90 days to the levels suggested in the request. 

(j)(1) Each formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 
through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by the following information, for each quarter 
following the base year in the most recent omnibus rate case: 

(i) Estimated volume by rate cell, for each Express Mail service; 

(ii) Total postage pounds of Express Mail rated at: 

(A) Up to 1/2 pound, 
(B) 1/2 pound up to 2 pounds, 
(C) 2 pounds up to 5 pounds; and 
(iii) Total pounds of Express Mail and of each other subclass of mail carried on 
hub contracts. 

(2) In each instance when rates change based on a proceeding under the 
provisions of   3001.57 through 3001.57c the Postal Service shall provide, one year 
after the conclusion of the test period, the data described in  3001.57a(j)(1)(i-iii), 
for each of the four quarters of the test period. 

(k) Each formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 
3001.57c shall include analyses to demonstrate: 

(1) That the proposed rates are consistent with the factors listed in 39 U.S.C. 3622 (b), 

(2) That the proposed rate changes are in the public interest and in accordance 
with the policies and applicable criteria of the Act, and 
(3) That the proposed rates will preserve, or minimize erosion of, the Express 
Mail contribution to institutional costs recommended in the most recent omnibus rate 
case. 
(l) Each formal request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 
3001.57c shall be accompanied by a certificate that service of the filing in accordance 
with  3001.57b (c) has been made. 



 3001.57b

Market Response Rate Requests_expedition of public notice and 
procedural schedule. 



(a) The purpose of this section is to provide a schedule for expediting proceedings when a trial-type hearing is required
in a proceeding in which the Postal Service 
proposes to adjust rates for Express Mail service in order to respond to a change in the 
market for expedited delivery services. 
(b) The Postal Service shall not propose for consideration under the provisions of 
  3001.57 through 3001.57c rates lower than: 

(1) The average per piece attributable cost for Express Mail service determined in 
the most recent omnibus rate case, or 

(2) The average per piece attributable cost for Express Mail service as determined 
by the Postal Service in accordance with  3001.57a (e) for the most recent fiscal 
year for which information is available, whichever is higher. Neither shall the Postal 
Service propose a rate for any rate cell which is lower than the estimated test period 
attributable cost of providing that rate cell with service.

(c) (1) Persons who are interested in participating in Express Mail Market 
Response Rate Request cases may register at any time with the Secretary of the Postal Rate Commission, who shall maintain
a publicly available list of the names and business addresses of all such Express Mail Market Response Registrants.
Persons whose names appear on this list will automatically become parties to each Express Mail Market Response rate
proceeding. Other interested persons may intervene pursuant to  3001.20 within 28 days of the filing of a formal
request made under the provisions of   3001.57 through 3001.57c. Parties may withdraw from the register
or a case by filing a notice with the Commission. 

(2) When the Postal Service files a request under the provisions of   3001.57 through 3001.57c it shall
on that same day effect service by hand delivery of the complete filing to each Express Mail Market Response Registrant
who maintains an address for service within the Washington metropolitan area and serve the complete filing by Express
Mail service on all other Registrants. Each Registrant is responsible for insuring that his or her address remains
current. 

(3) When the Postal Service files a request under the provisions of   3001.57 through 3001.57c, it shall
on that same day send by Express Mail service to all participants in the most recent omnibus rate case a notice which
briefly describes its proposal. Such notice shall indicate on its first page that it is a notice of an Express Mail Market
Response Rate Request to be considered under   3001.57 through 3001.57c, and identify the last day for
filing a notice of intervention with the Commission. 

(d) In the absence of a compelling showing of good cause, the Postal Service and parties shall calculate Express Mail
costs in accordance with the methodologies used by the Commission in the most recent omnibus rate case. In the analysis
of customers' reactions to the change in the market for expedited delivery services which prompts the request, the
Postal Service and parties may estimate the demand for segments of the expedited delivery market and for types of customers
which were not separately considered when estimating volumes in the most recent omnibus rate case. 

(e) (1) In the event that a party wishes to dispute as an issue of fact whether the Postal Service properly has calculated
Express Mail costs or volumes (either before or after its proposed changes), or wishes to dispute whether the change
in the market for expedited delivery services cited by the Postal Service has actually occurred, or wishes to dispute
whether the rates proposed by the Postal Service are a reasonable response to the change in the market for expedited
delivery services or are consistent with the policies of the Postal Reorganization Act, that party shall file with
the Commission a 
request for a hearing within 28 days of the date that the Postal Service files its request. The request for hearing shall
state with specificity the fact or facts set forth in the Postal Service's filing that the party disputes, and when
possible, what the party believes to be the true fact or facts and the evidence it intends to provide in support of its
position. 

(2) The Commission will not hold hearings on a request made pursuant 
to   3001.57 through 3001.57c unless it determines that there is a genuine issue of material fact to be
resolved, and that a hearing is needed to resolve this issue. 

(3) Whether or not a hearing is held, the Commission may request 
briefs and/or argument on an expedited schedule, but in any circumstance it will issue its recommended decision as
promptly as is consistent with its statutory responsibilities. 

(4) In order to assist in the rapid development of an adequate 
evidentiary record, all participants may file appropriate discovery requests on other participants as soon as an
Express Mail Market Response Rate Request is filed. Answers to such discovery requests will be due within 10 days.
Objections to such discovery requests must be made within 10 days in the form of a Motion to Excuse from Answering, with
service on the questioning participant made by hand, facsimile, or expedited delivery. Responses to Motions to Excuse
from Answering must be submitted within seven days, and should such a motion be denied, the answers to the discovery
in question are due within seven days of the denial thereof. It is the Commission's intention that parties resolve
discovery disputes informally between themselves whenever 
possible. The Commission, therefore, encourages the party receiving discovery requests considered to be unclear
or objectionable to contact counsel for the party filing the discovery requests whenever further explanation is
needed, or a potential discovery dispute might be resolved by means of such communication. 

(5) If, either on its own motion, or after having received a request for a hearing, the Commission concludes that there
exist one or more genuine issues of material fact and that a hearing is needed, the Commission shall expedite the conduct
of such record evidentiary hearings to meet both the need to respond promptly to changed circumstances in the market
and the standards of 5 U.S.C.  556 and 557. The procedural schedule, subject to change as described in paragraph
(e) (6) of this section, is as follows: Hearings on the Postal Service case will begin 35 days after the filing of an Express
Mail Market Response Rate Request; parties may file evidence either in support of or in opposition to the Postal Service
proposal 49 days after the filing; hearings on the 
parties' evidence will begin 56 days after the filing; briefs will be due 70 days after the filing; and reply briefs
will be due 77 days after the filing. 

(6) The Presiding Officer may adjust any of the schedule dates prescribed in paragraph (e)(5) of this section in the
interests of fairness, or to assist in the development of an adequate evidentiary record. Requests for the opportunity
to present evidence to rebut a submission by a participant other than the Postal Service should be filed within three
working days of the receipt of that material into the evidentiary record, and should include a description of the evidence
to be offered and the amount of time needed to 
prepare and present it. Requests for additional time will be reviewed with consideration as to whether the requesting
participant has exercised due diligence, and whether the requesting participant has been unreasonably delayed
from fully understanding the proposal. 



 3001.57c 

Express Mail Market Response_``rule for decision. 



The Commission will issue a recommended decision in accordance with the 
policies of 39 U.S.C., and which it determines would be a reasonable response to the change in the market for expedited
delivery services. The purpose of   3001.57 through 3001.57c is to allow for consideration of Express
Mail Market Response Rate Requests within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested
persons.

<DOCTITLE>Rules of Practice and Procedure; </DOCTITLE>
Procedural Streamlining Inquiry, Docket No. RM95-2 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Rate Commission. 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is soliciting suggestions from interested persons regarding potential mechanisms for expediting
its proceedings conducted under 39 U.S.C. 3624(a), which requires ``the opportunity for a hearing on the record under
sections 556 and 557 of title 5 * * *.'' The Commission's rules currently provide for the application
of streamlined procedures to certain categories of Postal Service requests, such as proposals to effect mail classification
changes that are experimental in character. See 39 CFR 3001.67, 3001.67a through .67d.

1

 In appropriate instances, the Commission has also implemented streamlined procedures in the form of Special Rules
of Practice adopted for individual postal rate and mail classification dockets. The proposed rulemaking contemplated
by the Commission would consider suggested additions to the permanent Rules of Practice and Procedure (39 CFR Part
3001) for the purpose of streamlining the procedures employed in additional categories of postal rate and mail classification
proceedings.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Postal Reorganization Act requires the Commission to afford the opportunity for a formal, on-the-record hearing
under sections 556 and 557 of title 5 in several categories of proceedings: those involving Postal Service requests
for changes in postal rates and mail classifications (39 U.S.C. 3624(a)); those involving Postal Service proposals
to make a change in the nature of postal services that will generally affect service on a nationwide or substantially
nationwide basis (39 U.S.C. 3661(c)); and complaint proceedings under 39 U.S.C. 3662 that concern postal rate or
mail classification matters. In proceedings initiated by a Postal Service request to change rates pursuant to section
3622, the Commission is obliged to transmit its recommended decision ``no later than 10 months after receiving any
such request[,]'' with a narrow exception for instances of Postal Service recalcitrance. 39 U.S.C. 3624 (c)(1) and
(c)(2). In order to conduct proceedings with the utmost expedition consistent with procedural fairness to the parties,
section 3624(b) authorizes the Commission to adopt rules for expediting its dockets to which the requirements of
5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 apply. 



In addition to the special-purpose procedural streamlining rules cited in the Summary, the Commission has pursued
expedition in its formal, on-the-record proceedings through the adoption of Special Rules of Practice and expedited
procedural schedules. For example, in the recently concluded omnibus rate proceeding, Docket No. R94-1, the
Commission expedited the discovery process by shortening the permanent rule's 20-day deadline for responses to
14 days. The Commission also expedited the procedural schedule by reducing the interval between oral argument in
the case and the Commission's rendition of an Opinion and Recommended Decision. By these and other means, the Commission
completed the R94-1 proceeding less than nine months after receiving the Postal Service's request. 

It must be noted that Docket No. R94-1 was not a typical omnibus rate case, in that it involved considerably less
than the usual spectrum of ratemaking and mail classification issues. Nonetheless, the expedition with which the
Commission succeeded in hearing and deciding the R94-1 case suggests that appropriate forms of procedural
streamlining, regularized in the Commission's rules of practice, may enable similar results in future proceedings.


Some forms of procedural streamlining may involve alterations in the terms of existing rules of practice. For example,
replacement of the current 20-day deadline for discovery responses (see 39 CFR 3001.25(b), .26(b), .27(b)) with
the 14-day interval adopted in the Special Rules of Practice in Docket No. R94-1 could serve to shorten the discovery
phase of most proceedings. Similarly, conversion of oral argument before the Commission (see 39 CFR 3001.37) into
an extraordinary procedure not usually employed could expedite the decisional phase of Commission proceedings
under section 3624. 

Other avenues of expedition may require more fundamental changes in the rules of practice, including the adoption
of new requirements and procedures. One model of procedural streamlining for consideration of Postal Service rate
requests is contained in draft legislation introduced in the 102nd Congress. S. 946, one of four postal reform bills
jointly sponsored by Senators Stevens and Pryor, would have decreased the statutory period for the Commission's
consideration of Postal Service rate requests to 265 days, while introducing several mandatory procedures to facilitate
an expedited proceeding. These procedures included: (1) Requiring the Postal Service to announce its intent to file
a rate case between 20 and 40 days in advance, and to enhance the information the Service files annually with the Commission,
to better prepare the Commission and interested parties for the actual filing; (2) requiring the Service to provide
information on its current financial condition, base year costs, revenues and volumes, and other detailed information
bearing on its forthcoming rate request at least 30 days before a request is filed; and (3) directing the Commission
to establish the most expeditious schedule possible for discovery in such proceedings. S. 946, 102d Cong., 1st Sess.
(1991); see 137 Cong. Rec. S. 5154-57 (daily ed. April 25, 1991). 

Interested parties are invited to address these and other potential means of streamlining the Commission's proceedings
under section 3624, consistent with procedural fairness and the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.
The Commission encourages interested parties to address the questions listed below, although other germane comments
are also welcome. 

1. What category or categories of Commission proceedings subject to the requirements of 39 U.S.C. 3624(a) should
be candidates for procedural streamlining? 

2. What additional undertakings or obligations on the part of the United States Postal Service would be reasonable
and appropriate to the more expeditious completion of such proceedings? 

3. Which procedures currently available to parties other than the Postal Service under the Commission's rules of
practice and procedure (39 CFR part 3001) for such proceedings could be curtailed or foreshortened in the interest
of expedition, consistent with due process and the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act?

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
for the purpose of correcting deficiencies and adding requirements for the control of volatile organic compounds
from surface coating, pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing, graphic arts, and synthetic organic chemical manufacturing
industry equipment leaks. In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is
set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be
withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.
EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action
should do so at this time. 



</SUMMARY>

Lead Fishing Sinkers; Response to Citizens' Request; Reopening of Public Hearing Reply Comment Period 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Reopening of public hearing reply comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is reopening the public hearing reply comment period for a proposed rule to prohibit the manufacture, processing,
and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11122), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
to prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing
sinkers. In that proposal, the Agency stated that it would hold an informal hearing if persons requested time for oral
comment. EPA received requests for a hearing. A notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 19, 1994 (59 FR 47832), announced a hearing for November 30, and December 1, 1994. The hearing was subsequently
held, and as part of the hearing process, reply comments could be submitted through December 15, 1994. 


EPA received requests seeking to extend the reply comment period deadline of December 15, 1994, for a period of time
after the availability of the hearing transcript. EPA expects to receive the public hearing transcript no later than
December 23, 1994. Therefore, in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to review the hearing transcript
before submitting reply comments, EPA has decided to reopen the reply comment period. Written reply comments must
now be received on or before January 6, 1995, and shall be restricted to comments on: (1) Other comments; (2) material
in the hearing record; and (3) material which was not and could not reasonably have been available to the commenting
party a sufficient time before main comments were due. 
A person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any comments submitted to EPA in connection with the proposed
rule. Any person who submits a comment that contains information claimed as confidential, must also submit a nonconfidential
version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim
information as confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or
some other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of business confidentiality
only to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality
for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA, the Agency will put the comments in the public docket
without further notice to that person.

Foreign Fishing; Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed 1995 initial specifications of groundfish and associated management measures; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS proposes initial harvest specifications of groundfish and associated management measures in the Gulf of Alaska
(GOA) for the 1995 fishing year. This action is necessary to carry out management objectives contained in the Fishery
Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP). 








</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The domestic and foreign groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA are managed by NMFS according
to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The FMP
is implemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672,
676, and 677. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. 
This action proposes for the 1995 fishing year: 
(1) Specifications of total allowable catch (TAC) for each groundfish target species category in the GOA and apportionments
thereof among domestic annual processing (DAP), joint venture processing (JVP), total allowable level of foreign
fishing (TALFF), and reserves; (2) apportionments of reserves to DAP; (3) apportionments of the sablefish TAC to
vessels using hook-and-line and trawl gear; (4) apportionments of pollock TAC; (5) apportionments of Pacific cod
TAC; (6) ``other species'' TAC; (7) halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits; and (8) seasonal allocations
of the halibut PSC limits. A discussion of each of these measures follows. 
Comments on the proposed 1995 specifications are invited from the public through (see 

DATES

). After again consulting with the Council, NMFS will publish final specifications for the 1995 fishing year in the


Federal Register

. 


1. Proposed Establishment of TACs and Apportionments Thereof Among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and Reserves 


Under  672.20(c)(1)(ii), NMFS, after consultation with the Council, publishes in the 

Federal Register

 proposed specifications of annual TACs and interim harvest limits. These proposed specifications indicate apportionments
of TACs among DAP, JVP, reserves, and TALFF for each target species and the ``other species'' category. The sum of the
TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield (OY) range, of 116,000-800,000 metric tons
(mt), established for these species. 
Species TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves under   611.92(c)(1) and
672.20(a)(2). DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP
amounts are intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea.
TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Existing harvesting and processing capacity of the
U.S. industry is capable of utilizing the entire 1995 TAC specification for GOA groundfish. Therefore, the Council
recommended that DAP equal TAC for each species category, resulting in no proposed amounts of TALFF or JVP for the 1995
fishing year. 
The reserves for the GOA are 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish target species categories, and
``other species.'' If necessary, these reserve amounts may be set aside for possible apportionment to DAP and/or
to JVP if the initial apportionments prove inadequate. Reserves that are not apportioned to DAP or JVP may be reapportioned
to TALFF. Given that the GOA groundfish TACs have been utilized fully by DAP since 1987, NMFS has reapportioned all
the reserves to DAP. 





Council met from September 28 to October 5, 1994, to review scientific information concerning groundfish stocks.
The preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, prepared and presented to the Council by the GOA Plan Team (Plan
Team), summarizes the best available scientific information. 







The September 1994 SAFE Report contains revised stock assessments for all species except sablefish and demersal
shelf rockfish (DSR). New assessments for these two species are discussed in the final SAFE Report issued in November.
New stock assessment models were used in the assessments for Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and thornyhead rockfish.
Additional information, based on 1993 trawl surveys, was presented for pollock, slope rockfish, Pacific ocean perch
(POP), pelagic shelf rockfish, and the flatfish groups. Details of the assessments can be found in the September 1994
SAFE Report. 






Substantial changes to the 1995 acceptable biological catches (ABCs), compared to 1994 ABCs, occurred for pollock,
Pacific cod, POP, arrowtooth flounder, and shallow-water flatfish. Changes to the 1995 ABCs also occurred for deep-water
flatfish, flathead sole, other rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, thornyhead rockfish, and Atka mackerel. The 1995
ABCs for rex sole, shortraker/rougheye and northern rockfish remain similar to the 1994 ABCs. 






The Plan Team recommended an ABC for pollock of 65,360 mt, down from 109,300 mt in 1994. The Plan Team chose a more conservative
exploitation strategy for this stock because of recent trends in poor recruitment of GOA pollock and because of ecosystem
considerations. The stock biomass for pollock has been declining for a number of years and even with the more conservative
exploitation strategy, the biomass is still likely to go below the threshold for sustainable yield. The Scientific
and Statistical Committee (SSC) concurred with the Plan Team's recommended ABC and the Council accepted the SSC's
recommendation.

An ABC of 103,000 mt was recommended by the Plan Team for Pacific cod. The 1995 ABC is double the 1994 ABC for this stock
because a higher natural mortality rate was assumed and because the stock assessment model was changed. The model
for assessing this stock was changed to a stock synthesis model, which resulted in a higher estimate of exploitable
biomass. The SSC expressed some concern over the large increase in ABC and recommended a range from the 1994 ABC level
of 50,400 mt to the Plan Team's recommended 1995 level of 103,000 mt. 
A new biomass estimate for POP resulted in a 1995 ABC that is more than twice the 1994 ABC. Age composition data also indicate
an exceptionally strong 1986 year class, especially in the Central and Western Regulatory areas. New biomass estimates
for POP indicate that POP is close to the rebuilding level, as established by the POP rebuilding plan, authorized under
Amendment 32 to the FMP. The assessment authors determined an ABC of 8,830 mt, which was then adjusted according to
established guidelines by the Plan Team, to provide a buffer between the ABC and the overfishing level. The resulting
ABC was 6,800 mt. The SSC did not agree with the guidelines for the downward adjustment of the ABC and recommended an
ABC of 8,830 mt, equal to the overfishing level. The SSC believes that adjusting the overfishing level upwards to create
a buffer between ABC and overfishing might be more appropriate. The Council accepted the SSC recommendation and set
the 1995 ABC at 8,830 mt. The TAC amount for POP is set by the POP rebuilding plan and is not affected by the ABC amount.

The new biomass estimates for shallow-water flatfish were greater than the previous estimates and the 1995 ABC (52,270
mt) is greater than the 1994 ABC (34,420 mt). The 1995 ABC for arrowtooth flounder (198,130 mt) is lower than the 1994
ABC (236,240 mt), based on new biomass estimates. New survey information indicated declines in biomass levels for
some flatfish groups, resulting in associated declines in ABCs. The 1995 ABCs for deep-water flatfish (14,590 mt)
and for flathead sole (28,790 mt) were both lower than the 1994 ABCs (16,510 mt and 35,850 mt, respectively). 
A new assessment model for thornyhead rockfish resulted in a Plan Team ABC recommendation of 2,320 mt, which is double
the 1994 ABC. Because rockfish are vulnerable to over-exploitation and because the model is new, the SSC recommended
phasing in the new ABC. A 4-year stair-step approach to implementation of the Plan Team's recommended ABC was recommended
so that the new assessment model can be reevaluated after the 1996 trawl survey. For 1995, the ABC was set at 5/8 of the
Plan Team's ABC because the 1994 ABC was about one-half the new ABC. This procedure results in a 1995 ABC of 1,450 mt.

The 1995 ABC for Atka mackerel, recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council, is similar to the 1994 ABC. The Plan
Team recommended an ABC of 6,480 mt. However, in 1994, when Atka mackerel was separated from the ``other species''
category, the Plan Team's calculated 1994 ABC was reduced to 3/6. This reduction factor would increase by 1/6 per year
(stair stepping) and be multiplied by subsequent annual calculated ABCs. The SSC recommended that this procedure
be continued to maintain consistency of approach for the management of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI)
management area and the GOA Atka mackerel resource. Continuing the stair-step approach for the 1995 fishing year,
the calculated ABC should be reduced to 4/6 of the Plan Team's 1995 ABC. Using this approach, the SSC recommended an
ABC of 4,300 mt. This approach also takes into account concern about survey variability and concerns for northern
fur seals and Steller sea lions, which feed on Atka mackerel. Even though the stair-step approach provides some protection
to this stock, the SSC expressed concern that other management measures be considered to reduce the potential impacts
on marine mammals. 
New assessments for other rockfish, northern rockfish, shortraker/rougheye and pelagic shelf rockfish resulted
in slightly lower 1995 ABCs for these groups, compared to the 1994 ABCs. Because there were no new assessments for DSR
and sablefish at this time, the ABCs for these two groups remain unchanged. 
The Plan Team and the SSC recommended removing redbanded rockfish (

Sebastes babcocki

) from the DSR group and placing it in the ``other rockfish'' category because this species can constrain the DSR fishery
and it is caught as bycatch in the ``other rockfish'' category. This would not affect the ABC recommendation for either
group. The Plan Team had recommended removing black rockfish from the pelagic shelf rockfish group but the SSC did
not agree, because not enough biological data exist on black rockfish biomass. 
The total ABC amount recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council was a range from 481,090_533,690 mt. The range
accounted for the recommended ABC range in the Pacific cod stock. The total TAC amount recommended by the Advisory
Panel (AP) was 326,515 mt. The AP recommended a 1995 TAC equal to the 1995 ABCs, as recommended by the SSC, for pollock,
rex sole, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, DSR, and
thornyhead rockfish. The AP recommendation for a 1995 TAC for Pacific cod was equal to the upper end of the range (103,000
mt) recommended by the SSC. 
The AP recommended a 1995 TAC that was lower than the 1995 ABC recommended by the SSC, and that was equal to the 1994 TAC,
for deep-water flatfish, flathead sole, shallow-water flatfish, and Atka mackerel. 
Because the POP biomass was higher than in 1994, the 1995 TAC for POP is higher than in 1994. As mentioned above, the TAC
for POP is specified in the rebuilding plan and the apportionments are based on the biomass distribution in each of
the GOA regulatory areas. 
The AP increased the 1995 apportionment from the 1994 TAC for arrowtooth flounder in the Central Regulatory area by
5,000 mt, to 25,000 mt. The TAC amount for arrowtooth flounder in the other regulatory areas is the same as the 1994 TAC
amount, resulting in a total of TAC of 35,000 mt. 
The Council considered information in the SAFE Report, recommendations from its SSC and its AP, as well as public testimony.
The Council then accepted the ABCs as recommended by the SSC and, with the exception of slope rockfish, the TACs as recommended
by the AP. 
The Council chose a TAC range for ``other rockfish'' that ranged from the 1994 TAC amount of 2,235 mt to the 1995 ABC amount
of 6,930 mt. This range was recommended to recognize the need for conservative management of this group. However,
NMFS must manage the fisheries based on a single TAC amount, rather than on a range of numbers. NMFS has chosen to propose
a TAC of 6,930 mt, which is the number proposed by the AP and is the ABC that was recommended from the 1994 stock assessment.
Even though this number will be used to establish the 1995 interim TAC until the final specifications are implemented,
no practical difference exists in choosing any number within the Council's recommended TAC range. The hook-and-line
fisheries typically do not harvest slope rockfish and the trawl fisheries for rockfish do not open until July 1, by
which time the final specifications will be published. 
NMFS also revises the Council's recommendation for the 1995 flathead sole TAC. The Council approved the AP recommendation
of adopting the 1994 TAC amounts for flathead sole for the 1995 TAC amounts. In the GOA Eastern Regulatory Area, the
1994 TAC amount (3,000 mt) is higher than the Council's recommended 1995 ABC (2,740 mt). To maintain consistency with
the accepted policy of setting TACs lower than or equal to ABC amounts, NMFS is proposing to establish a 1995 TAC of 2,740
mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area. This number is equal to the 1995 ABC recommended by the Plan Team and the SSC and approved
by the Council. Adjustment of the flathead sole TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area changes the total 1995 flathead
sole TAC to 9,740 mt. This also results in a revised ``other species'' TAC amount of 15,535 mt and a revised 1995 total
GOA TAC of 326,242 mt. 
The 1995 ABCs, TACs and interim TACs, as well as the ABC and TAC apportionments, are shown in Table 1.

2. Proposed Apportionment of Reserves to DAP 


Regulations implementing the FMP require 20 percent of each TAC for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish species, and the
``other species'' category be set aside in reserves for possible apportionment at a later date ( 672.20(a)(2)(ii)).
Consistent with  672.20(a)(2)(iii), NMFS is proposing to apportion the 1995 reserves for each of the four species
categories to DAP, anticipating that domestic harvesters and processors have established markets for these species
and should be provided the opportunity to realize revenues from the harvest of the full DAP amounts so specified. Specifications
of DAP shown in Table 1 reflect apportioned reserves. 




3. Proposed Apportionment of the Sablefish TACs to Users of Hook-and-Line and Trawl Gear 



Under  672.24(c), sablefish TACs for each of the regulatory areas and districts are assigned to hook-and-line
and trawl gear. In the Central and Western Regulatory Areas, 80 percent of the TAC is allocated to hook-and-line gear
and 20 percent is allocated to trawl gear. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, 95 percent of the TAC is assigned to hook-and-line
gear and 5 percent is assigned to trawl gear. The trawl gear allocation in the Eastern Regulatory Area may only be used
as bycatch to support directed fisheries for other target species. Sablefish caught in the GOA with gear other than
hook-and-line or trawl must be treated as prohibited species and may not be retained. Table 2 shows the assignments
of the proposed 1995 sablefish TACs between hook-and-line and trawl gears. 
















4. Proposed Apportionments of Pollock TAC 


In the GOA, pollock is apportioned by area and season. These amounts are further apportioned between inshore and offshore
components. Regulations at  672.20(a)(2)(iv) require that the TAC for pollock in the combined Western/Central
Regulatory Areas (W/C) be apportioned among statistical areas Shumagin (61), Chirikof (62), and Kodiak (63) in proportion
to known distribution of the pollock biomass. This measure was intended to provide spatial distribution of the pollock
harvest as a sea lion protection measure. Each statistical area apportionment is further divided equally into the
four calendar quarters. Within any fishing year, any unharvested amount of any quarterly allowance of pollock TAC
is added in equal proportions to the quarterly allowances of following quarters, resulting in a sum for each quarter
not to exceed 150 percent of the initial quarterly allowance. Similarly, harvests in excess of a quarterly allowance
of TAC are deducted in equal proportions from the remaining quarterly allowances of that fishing year. The Eastern
Regulatory Area proposed TAC of 3,360 mt is not allocated among smaller areas, or quarterly. 
Regulations at  672.20(a)(2)(v)(A) require that the DAP apportionment for pollock in all regulatory areas
and all quarterly allowances thereof be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is apportioned
100 percent of the pollock DAP in each regulatory area after subtraction of amounts that are determined by the Director,
Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to be necessary to support the bycatch needs of the offshore component in
directed fisheries for other groundfish species. At this time, these bycatch amounts are unknown, and will be determined
during the fishing year. The proposed distribution of pollock within the combined W/C GOA is shown in Table 3, except
that inshore and offshore component apportionments of pollock are not shown.

5. Proposed Apportionments of Pacific Cod TAC 



Regulations at  672.20(a)(2)(v)(B) require that the DAP apportionment of Pacific cod in all regulatory areas
be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is equal to 90 percent of the Pacific cod TAC
in each regulatory area. Inshore and offshore component allocations of the proposed 103,000 mt TAC for each regulatory
area are shown in Table 4.

6. ``Other Species'' TAC 




The FMP specifies that amounts for the ``other species'' category are calculated as 5 percent of the combined TACs
for target species. The GOA-wide ``other species'' TAC is calculated as 15,535 mt, which is 5 percent of the sum of combined
TACs for the target species. 





7. Proposed Halibut PSC Mortality Limits 





Under  672.20(f), annual Pacific halibut PSC mortality limits are established for trawl and hook-and-line
gear and may be established for pot gear. 

At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended that, for 1995, NMFS re-establish 1994 PSC limits of 2,000
mt and 750 mt for the trawl and hook-and-line gear fisheries, respectively, with 10 mt of the hook-and-line limit allocated
to the DSR fishery in the Southeast Outside District and the remainder to other hook-and-line gear fisheries. As in
1994, the Council proposes to exempt pot gear from halibut limits for 1994. 

At its September 1994 meeting, the Council also recommended that NMFS initiate rulemaking that would authorize exemption
of the hook-and-line sablefish fishery from the halibut PSC limit. The Council recommended this because of the 1995
implementation of the sablefish and halibut Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program, which would allow legal-sized
halibut to be retained in the sablefish fishery. NMFS is preparing a proposed rule to implement the Council's recommendation.
The proposed rule would also specify a reduced halibut PSC limit for the 1995 GOA hook-and-line gear fisheries other
than sablefish. The Council recommended that the trawl fishery apportionment of the 1995 halibut bycatch mortality
limit (2,000 mt) remain unchanged from 1994. 





In 1994, NMFS approved a rule that authorizes separate apportionments of the trawl halibut bycatch mortality limit
between trawl fisheries for deep-water and shallow-water species (59 FR 38132, July 27, 1994). These apportionments
are divided seasonally to avoid seasonally high halibut bycatch rates. 





NMFS preliminarily concurs in the Council's 1995 recommendations. Some changes may be made in the seasonal, gear
type and fishing-complex apportionments of halibut PSC limits for the final 1995 specifications. NMFS considers
the following types of information as presented by, and summarized from, the preliminary 1994 SAFE Report, or from
public comment and testimony. 






(A) Estimated Halibut Bycatch in Prior Years 





The best available information on estimated halibut bycatch is available from data collected in 1994 by NMFS-certified
observers. The calculated halibut bycatch mortality by trawl, hook-and-line, and pot gear through November 11,
1994, is 2,221 mt, 752 mt, and 4 mt, respectively, for a total of 2,977 mt. Halibut bycatch restrictions seasonally
constrained trawl gear fisheries during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of the fishing year. Trawling,
with the exception of trawling for pollock with pelagic trawl gear, was closed in 1994 from March 21 to March 31 for the
shallow-water species complex (59 FR 13894, March 24, 1994); from April 22 to June 30 for the deep-water species complex
(59 FR 21946, April 28, 1994); from May 19 to June 30 for the shallow-water species complex (59 FR 26761, May 24, 1994);
from August 15 to September 30 for the shallow-water complex (59 FR 42776, August 19, 1994); and from August 29 to September
30 for the deep-water complex (59 FR 45239, September 1, 1994), as a result of halibut PSC seasonal allowances. The
fourth quarter halibut PSC allowance was reached on October 29 (59 FR 55066, November 3, 1994). Hook-and-line gear
was closed to directed fishing for all but DSR on May 








28 to December 31, 1994 (59 FR 17737, April 14, 1994; 59 FR 43296, August 23, 1993). The sablefish hook-and-line gear
fishery was reopened for a 48-hour period in September, 1994, concurrent with the Pacific halibut fishery (59 FR 44944,
August 31, 1994). 



The amount of groundfish that trawl or hook-and-line gear might have harvested, if halibut PSC had not been seasonally
limiting in 1994, is unknown. However, lacking market incentives, some amounts of groundfish will not be harvested,
regardless of halibut PSC bycatch availability. 



(B) Expected Changes in Groundfish Stocks 



At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended lower 1995 ABCs than 1994 ABCs for pollock, deep-water flatfish,
rex sole, flathead sole, arrowtooth flounder, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, shortraker/rougheye,
and Atka mackerel. Higher 1995 ABCs, as compared to the 1994 ABCs, were recommended for Pacific cod, shallow-water
flatfish, POP, and thornyhead rockfish. 

The 1995 ABCs for DSR and sablefish are unchanged from 1994 levels. More information on these proposed changes is included
in the preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, and in the AP, SSC, and Council minutes from the September 1994
meeting. 



(C) Expected Changes in Groundfish Catch 



The total of the proposed 1995 specified TACs for the GOA is 326,242 mt, which represents 107 percent of the sum of TACs
for 1994 (304,589 mt). Significant changes in TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, POP, other rockfish, shallow-water
rockfish, and arrowtooth flounder are proposed. Increased TACs for some groups could result in increased halibut
mortality associated with those fisheries. The changes in pollock TACs are not expected to affect halibut bycatches,
because most of the pollock harvest in the GOA is accomplished with pelagic trawls that experience low bycatch rates
of halibut. 



(D) Current Estimates of Halibut Biomass and Stock Condition 



The stock assessment for 1993 conducted by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) indicates that the
total exploitable biomass of Pacific halibut in the BSAI management area and the GOA together was 300.4 million lb
(136,236 mt) using the standard assessment methods and 249.8 million lb (113,288 mt) when discounting the effects
of an upturn in catch per unit effort for 1992 and 1993. This represents a decline in biomass of 12-15 percent from
the previous stock assessment, a rate that is higher than the 5-10 percent annual decline observed in previous
years. Exploitable biomass was estimated at 219.6 million lb (99,592 mt) for the GOA areas, a decrease of 13 percent
with respect to the 1992 biomass. Recruitment was the lowest in 20 years, but was consistent with cyclical patterns
of recruitment that have occurred over the last 50 years. The low recruitment exhibited in recent years can be expected
to contribute to a continued decline in the overall stock at a rate of 10-15 percent over the next several years.
Some changes may be made to the IPHC Report in November.

(E) Potential Impacts of Expected Fishing for Groundfish on Halibut Stocks and U.S. Halibut Fisheries 



Halibut fisheries will be adjusted to account for the overall halibut PSC mortality limit established for groundfish
fisheries. The 1995 groundfish fisheries are expected to use the entire proposed halibut PSC limit of 2,750 mt. The
allowable directed commercial catch is determined by accounting for the recreational catch, waste, and bycatch
mortality, and then providing the remainder to the directed fishery. How this affects the directed fishery depends
on the constant exploitable yield (CEY) determined by the IPHC. Therefore, if the PSC limit of 2,750 mt is instituted
for the 1995 fishery, the results could be either positive or negative to the directed halibut fishery, depending
on whether the CEY is higher or lower than it was in the previous year's fishery. 



(F) Methods Available For, and Costs of, Reducing Halibut Bycatches in Groundfish Fisheries 



Methods available for reducing halibut bycatch include (1) reducing amounts of groundfish TACs, (2) reducing halibut
bycatch rates through a Vessel Incentive Program, (3) modifying gear, (4) changing groundfish fishing seasons,
and (5) instituting individual transferable quota programs designed to reduce the derby-style fishing. 

Reductions in groundfish TACs provide no incentives for fishermen to reduce bycatch rates. Costs that would be imposed
on fishermen as a result of reducing TACs depend on species and amounts of groundfish foregone. 

Trawl vessels carrying observers for purposes of complying with the Observer Plan are subject to the Vessel Incentive
Program. The program encourages trawl fishermen to avoid high halibut bycatch rates while conducting groundfish
fisheries by specifying bycatch rate standards for various target fisheries. 

Current regulations require groundfish pots to have halibut exclusion devices to reduce halibut bycatches. Resulting
low bycatch and mortality rates of halibut in pot fisheries have justified exempting pot gear from PSC limits. 

Regulations also define pelagic trawl gear in a manner intended to reduce bycatch of halibut by displacing fishing
effort off the bottom of the sea floor when certain halibut bycatch levels are reached during the fishing year. The
definition provides standards for physical conformation and also for performance of the trawl gear in terms of crab
bycatch (58 FR 39680, July 26, 1993). Furthermore, all hook-and-line vessel operators are required to employ careful
release measures when handling halibut bycatch. This measure is intended to reduce handling mortality, increase
the amount of groundfish harvested under the available halibut mortality bycatch limits, and possibly lower overall
halibut bycatch mortality in groundfish fisheries. 

Halibut bycatch has been reduced by changes in some groundfish fishing seasons. In 1994, the sablefish hook-and-line
season started May 18, and the rockfish trawl fishery was delayed until the third quarter, July 1. These delays postponed
the start of the sablefish and rockfish fisheries to times when seasonal halibut bycatch rates are lower. In 1995,
the season start date for sablefish, under the IFQ program, will be March 1 ( 676.23(b)). 

The anticipated implementation in 1995 of the sablefish/halibut IFQ program should reduce the halibut discard mortality
in the sablefish fishery because any legal-sized halibut caught by vessels with quota-share holders onboard must
be retained. 

Methods available for reducing halibut bycatch listed above will be reviewed by NMFS and the Council to determine
their effectiveness. Changes will be initiated, as necessary, in response to this review or to public testimony and
comment. 

Consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP to reduce halibut bycatches while providing an opportunity to
harvest the groundfish OY, NMFS proposes the assignments of 2,000 mt and 750 mt of halibut PSC mortality limits to trawl
and hook-and-line gear, respectively. While these limits would reduce the harvest quota for commercial halibut
fishermen, NMFS has determined that they would not result in unfair allocation to any particular user group. NMFS
recognizes that some halibut bycatch will occur in the groundfish fishery, but expansion of the Vessel Incentive
Program, required modifications to gear, implementation of the IFQ program, and changes in the season start date
for some fisheries are intended to reduce adverse impacts on halibut fishermen while promoting the opportunity to
achieve the OY from the groundfish fishery. 

As mentioned above, NMFS is pursuing rulemaking that would authorize the annual exemption of the sablefish hook-and-line
gear fishery from halibut bycatch restrictions. This action was recommended by the Council based on the anticipation
of reduced halibut discard mortality in the fishery under the IFQ program and to support the first-year implementation
of the IFQ program. This action would minimize competition within the sablefish hook-and-line fleet for halibut
bycatch before individual sablefish quota-share amounts are harvested. 



8. Proposed Seasonal Allocations of the Halibut PSC Limits 



Under  672.20(f)(2)(iii), NMFS proposes to allocate seasonally the halibut PSC limits based on recommendations
from the Council. The FMP requires that the following information be considered by the Council in recommending seasonal
allocations of halibut: (1) Seasonal distribution of halibut, (2) seasonal distribution of target groundfish species
relative to halibut distribution, (3) expected halibut bycatch needs on a seasonal basis relevant to changes in halibut
biomass and expected catches of target groundfish species, (4) expected bycatch rates on a seasonal basis, (5) expected
changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons, (6) expected actual start of fishing effort, and, (7) economic effects
of establishing seasonal halibut allocations on segments of the target groundfish industry. 

The Council recommended the same seasonal allocation of PSC limits for the 1995 fishing year as those in effect during
the 1994 fishing year. The publication of the final 1994 initial groundfish and PSC specifications (59 FR 7647, February
16, 1994) summarizes Council findings with respect to each of the FMP considerations set forth above. At this time,
the Council's findings are unchanged from those set forth for 1994.

<PARENT> FR941222-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Pacific halibut PSC catch limits, and apportionments thereof, are presented in Table 5. Regulations specify that
any overages or shortfalls in PSC catches will be accounted for within the 1995 season. 

The Council did not recommend changes in the seasonal apportionments for the hook-and-line gear fisheries from those
specified in 1994; however, NMFS notes that the opening date of the sablefish fishery is scheduled to change from May
18, in 1994, to March 1, in 1995, under the IFQ program. This change and the Council's proposed exemption of the sablefish
fishery from the 1995 PSC limit may prompt the Council to alter its recommendation for seasonal apportionments at
its December 1994 meeting. 






Regulations at  672.20(f)(1) authorize apportionments of the trawl halibut PSC limit allowance as bycatch
allowances to a deep-water species complex, comprising sablefish, rockfish, deep-water flatfish, and arrowtooth
flounder, and a shallow-water species complex, comprising pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead
sole, Atka mackerel, and other species. The apportionment for these two complexes is presented in Table 6. 









Assumed halibut mortality rates for halibut PSC bycatch in 1995 are based on an average of mortality rates determined
from NMFS-observer data collected during 1992 and 1993, except for the GOA hook-and-line rockfish, for which 1992/93
rates were not available and the rates from 1990 and 1991 were used. Except as noted below, the Council proposed that
revised halibut discard mortality rates recommended by the IPHC be adopted for purposes of monitoring halibut bycatch
mortality limits established for the 1995 groundfish fisheries. The Council's action would establish two separate
mortality rates for the GOA bottom trawl pollock fishery: 54 percent for shoreside operations and 81 percent for offshore
operations. The proposed rate differences for at-sea and shoreside processors result from analyses by the IPHC that
showed that at-sea processing vessels had a significantly higher discard mortality rate than the shorebased operators.
However, NMFS notes that directed fishing for GOA pollock by the offshore component is prohibited under  672.20(a)(2)(v).



The IPHC determined that the careful release measures implemented for vessels using hook-and-line gear did not show
appreciable improvements in mortality rates and has recommended one rate for both observed and unobserved vessels
in the hook-and-line fisheries. This action was approved by the Council. The halibut mortality rates are listed in
Table 7.

For most fisheries, the 1992-93 averages, on which the 1995 recommendations are based, are somewhat higher
than the actual rate used in 1994. This occurs because the rates used in 1994 were a rollover of the 1993 rates, which
had been derived from data for 1990 and 1991. After the December 1994 Council meeting, NMFS will consider all available
data and will publish preseason assumed halibut mortality rates in the Federal Register

 publication announcing the final 1995 initial specifications of groundfish TACs. 


Interim Groundfish Harvest Specifications 




Current regulations at  672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A) require that one-fourth of the preliminary TAC (not including
the reserves and the first quarterly allowance of pollock), one-fourth of the inshore and offshore allocations of
Pacific cod in each regulatory area, and one-fourth of the halibut PSC amounts, take effect on January 1 on an interim
basis and remain in effect until superseded by the final 1995 initial specifications published in the 

Federal Register

 or until harvested. Seasonal apportionments of TACs or PSC limits under provisions of other regulations may supersede
these interim specifications. Table 1 shows amounts of proposed specifications of target species and the ``other
species'' categories. NMFS is publishing interim initial specifications as a separate document in the final rule
section of today's 

Federal Register

. 


Opening Date of the Directed Fishery for Sablefish for Hook-and-Line Gear 



Under new regulations implementing the IFQ program (50 CFR part 676) in 1995, the opening date of the sablefish fishery
is March 1. 


Closures to Directed Fishing 



After consideration of public comments and additional scientific information presented at its December 1994 meeting,
the Council may recommend closures to directed fishing. Additionally, NMFS may implement other closures at the time
the final 1995 initial specifications of groundfish TACs are implemented, or during the 1995 fishing year as necessary
for effective management. 

Under  672.20(b)(1), when NMFS determines, after 
consultation with the Council, that the TAC for any species or 
species group will be fully harvested in the DAP fishery, NMFS may specify, for each calendar year, the PSC limit applicable
to any JVP or TALFF fisheries for that species or species group. Any PSC limit specified shall be for bycatch only and
cannot be retained. Under  672.20(c)(6), if the Regional Director determines that a PSC limit applicable to
a directed JVP or TALFF fishery has been or will be reached, NMFS will publish a closure in the 

Federal Register

 prohibiting all further JVP or TALFF fishing in all or part of the regulatory area concerned. 

The Council did not propose any PSC limits for fully utilized groundfish species at its September meeting, and it is
not expected to make such recommendations at its December meeting. Groundfish PSC limits would only have been relevant
if the Council had recommended groundfish apportionments to JVP or TALFF. The Council is not expected to recommend
JVP or TALFF apportionments for the 1995 fishing year. 


Classification 



This action is authorized under 50 CFR 611.92 and 672.20; and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. 

A draft environmental assessment (EA) on the allowable harvest levels set forth in the final 1994 SAFE Report will
be available for public review at the December 1994 Council meeting. After the December meeting, a final EA will be
prepared on the final 1995 TAC amounts recommended by the Council. 

Consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Endangered Species Act has been initiated for the 1995 GOA initial specifications.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to amend the regulations for 
hazardous waste management under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA is listing, 
as hazardous, five wastes generated during the production of dyes and pigments because certain ways 
of disposing of these wastes may present a risk to human health and the environment. EPA also is 
proposing not to list as hazardous six other wastes from this industry, and to defer action on three 
wastes due to insufficient information. The proposal would add the toxic constituents found in the 
wastes to the list of constituents that serve as a basis for classifying wastes as hazardous. This 
action also describes EPA's policy on making listing determinations, and the risk-based criteria 
used by the Agency. 


This action is proposed under the authority of Sections 3001(e)(2) and 3001(b)(1) of the 
Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), which direct EPA to make a hazardous waste 
listing determination for dye and pigment wastes. If finalized, this regulation would regulate 
these wastes as hazardous wastes under Subtitle C of RCRA. Additionally, this action proposes to 
designate the wastes proposed for listing as hazardous substances subject to the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). EPA is not taking action at this 
time to adjust the one-pound statutory reportable quantities (RQs) for these substances.

A. Statutory and Regulatory Authorities 


These regulations are proposed under the authority of Sections 2002(a) and 3001(b) and 
3001(e)(2) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6912(a), and 6921(b) and (e)(2), as amended by 
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA). These statutes commonly are referred to as 
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and are codified at Volume 42 of the United States 
Code (U.S.C.), sections 6901 to 6992(k) (42 U.S.C. 6901-6992(k)). 
Section 102(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 
1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9602(a) is the authority for the CERCLA aspects of this rule. 
Section 3001(a) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921(a), requires EPA to promulgate criteria for identifying 
characteristics of hazardous wastes and for listing hazardous wastes. Section 3001(b) of RCRA 
requires EPA to promulgate regulations, based on these criteria, identifying and listing hazardous 
wastes which shall be subject to the requirements of the Act.

Hazardous waste is defined at Section 1004(5) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6903(5). There are two types 
of hazardous waste. First, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may cause or significantly 
contribute to an increase in mortality, serious irreversible illness, or incapacitating reversible 
illness. In addition, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may pose a substantial present 
or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed. 
EPA's regulations establishing criteria for listing hazardous wastes are codified at Title 40 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  261.11 (40 CFR 261.11). Section 261.11 
states three criteria for identifying characteristics and for listing wastes as hazardous. 
First, wastes may be classified as ``characteristic'' wastes if they have the properties 
described at 40 CFR 261.21-24 which would cause them to be classified as having the characteristics 
of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity or toxicity. 
Second, wastes may be classified as acutely hazardous if they are fatal to humans at low doses, 
lethal in animal studies at particular doses designated in the regulation, or otherwise capable of 
causing or significantly contributing to an increase in serious illness. 
Third, wastes may be listed as hazardous if they contain hazardous constituents identified in 
Appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 and the Agency concludes, after considering eleven factors 
enumerated in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3), that the waste is capable of posing a substantial present or 
potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed. Such wastes are 
designated as toxic wastes. A substance is listed in Appendix VIII if it has been shown in 
scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic effects on humans or other 
life forms. 
Wastes listed as hazardous are subject to federal requirements under RCRA for persons who 
generate, transport, treat, store or dispose of such waste. Facilities that must meet the hazardous 
waste management requirements, including the need to obtain permits to operate, commonly are 
referred to as Subtitle C facilities. Subtitle C is Congress' original statutory designation for 
that part of RCRA that directs EPA to issue those regulations for hazardous wastes as may be 
necessary to protect human health or the environment. Thus, facilities like incinerators or 
landfills that are required to comply with RCRA requirements for hazardous waste are referred to as Subtitle C incinerators
or landfills. 
Subtitle C is codified as Subchapter III of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of 
the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 6921 through 6939(e)). EPA standards and procedural regulations 
implementing Subtitle C are found generally at 40 CFR parts 260 through 272. 
Solid wastes that are not hazardous wastes may be disposed of at facilities that are overseen 
by state and local governments. These are the so-called Subtitle D facilities. Subtitle D is 
Congress' original statutory designation for that part of RCRA that deals with federal assistance to 
state and regional planning efforts for disposal of solid waste. 
Subtitle D is codified as Subchapter IV of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of 
the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 6941 through 6949(a)). EPA regulations affecting Subtitle D 
facilities are found generally at 40 CFR parts 240 thru 247, and 255 thru 258. 
Section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6921(e)(2)) requires EPA to determine whether to list as 
hazardous wastes generated by various chemical production processes, including the production of 
dyes and pigments. 
In June of 1991, EPA entered into a proposed consent decree in a lawsuit filed by the 
Environmental Defense Fund, 

et al.

 (

EDF

 v. 

Reilly,

 Civ. No. 89-0598 (D.D.C.), hereinafter referred 
to as the settlement agreement), in which the Agency agreed to publish a proposed determination as 
to whether or not to list as hazardous certain wastes from the production of dyes and pigments by 
November 30, 1994 and to promulgate a final decision by November 30, 1995. 
There are three major classes of dyes and pigments: Azo/benzidine, anthraquinone, and 
triarylmethane. The settlement agreement specifies that the listing is to address the azo, monoazo, 
diazo, triazo, polyazo, azoic, and benzidine categories of the azo/benzidine dye and pigment class; 
the anthraquinone and perylene categories of the anthraquinone dye and pigment class; and the 
triarylmethane, triphenylmethane, and pyrazolone categories of the triarylmethane dye and pigment 
class. The settlement agreement also specifies that the listing is to address the following types 
of wastes where they are found: spent catalysts, reactor still overheads, vacuum system condensate, 
process waters, spent adsorbent, equipment cleaning sludge, product mother liquor, product 
standardization filter cake, dust collector filter fines, recovery still bottoms, treated wastewater 
effluent, and wastewater treatment sludge. 
As part of its regulations implementing Section 3001(e) of RCRA, EPA published a list of 
hazardous wastes that includes hazardous wastes generated from non-specific sources and a list of 
hazardous wastes from specific sources. These lists have been amended several times, and are 
published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 40 CFR 261.32, respectively. In this action, EPA is proposing to 
amend 40 CFR 261.32 to add five wastes from specific sources generated during the production of dyes 
and pigments. 
Those hazardous constituents that are proposed to be included in Appendix VII to part 261, 
Basis for Listing Hazardous Waste, also are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII of Part 261, the 
list of Hazardous Constituents, if not already included in this list. 
All hazardous wastes listed under RCRA and codified in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as 
any solid waste that exhibits one or more of the characteristics of a RCRA hazardous waste (as 
defined in 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.24), are also hazardous substances under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. See CERCLA 
Section 101(14)(C). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40 CFR 302.4 along 
with their reportable quantities (RQs). Accordingly, the Agency is proposing to list the proposed 
wastes in this action as CERCLA hazardous substances in Table 302.4 of 40 CFR 302.4. EPA is not 
taking action at this time to adjust the one-pound statutory RQs for these substances. 


B. EPA's Hazardous Waste Listing Determination Policy 


EPA believes that it should provide the public with a better understanding of the basis for 
EPA's listing decisions. Accordingly, EPA presents here the general approach the Agency uses for 
determining whether to list a waste as hazardous pursuant to 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3). This presentation 
focuses on selection of waste management scenarios used in assessing risk and the use of information 
on risk levels in making listing determinations. These elements are an important part of EPA's 
general listing policy and critical aspects to the dyes and pigments listing determination. It is 
important to note that this discussion presents EPA's general listing policy and is not a 
rulemaking. The Agency may take action at variance with this general policy. The Agency is seeking 
comment on its policy in order to get input from the public, not in order to promulgate binding 
rules for listing determinations. The Agency will review any comments received and may revise its 
policy based on such comments. However, the Agency does not intend to respond to comments 
submitted. 
The listing criteria described here focus on several aspects of the Agency's listing 
determination process. The discussion is not intended to cover all potential aspects of these 
determinations. For example, analyzing population risk is not included in this presentation. The 
Agency solicits comment on how population risks could be included as a factor in listing 
determinations. The Agency's approach to calculating distributions of individual risk values when 
determining ``high end'' risk and the Agency's position on how far into the future it will consider 
risk are not covered in today's notice. The Agency solicits comment on these factors and their use 
in listing determinations.

Currently, risk levels (including carcinogen risk, non-carcinogen risk as determined by hazard quotient (HQ),
and ecological risk) provide one of the principal bases for a listing determination. However, risk levels themselves
do not represent the sole basis for a listing. Other factors generally are weighed in making a listing decision. The
Agency's listing decision policy uses a ``weight-of-evidence'' approach in which calculated risk information
is a key factor. Available risk values are assessed with all other data available to determine whether a waste is or
is not a hazardous waste. 

The criteria for listing wastes as hazardous are described in 40 CFR 261.11. They are presented in two basic parts:
Numeric criteria for acutely hazardous wastes (defined by 40 CFR 261.11(a)(2)); and criteria for toxic wastes (defined
by 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)) containing toxic constituents listed in Appendix VIII to Part 261 (where 11 factors are considered
in determining ``substantial present or potential hazard to human health and the environment'').
Of these 11 factors, seven deal with risk (constituent toxicity, concentration, waste quantity, migration potential,
persistence, degradation product potential, and bioaccumulation potential) and are integrated into the risk values
generated. The other four factors (plausible management, damage cases, coverage of other regulatory programs,
and other factors as may be appropriate) are individual factors that also are considered in a listing determination.
Waste quantity (specifically, ``de minimis'' amounts of waste) also can be a special consideration in making a listing
determination for a lower volume wastestream. 



1. Selection of Waste Management Scenarios (261.11(a)(3)(vii)) 



As noted above, one of the many factors that the Agency takes into account is the ``plausible types of improper management
to which the waste could be subjected.'' 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(vii). Exposures to wastes (and therefore the risks involved)
will vary by waste management practice. 

It is important to note that a management scenario need not be in use currently to be considered plausible by EPA since
disposal practices can and do change over time. Potential future waste management practices are projected and considered
in the risk analysis, if appropriate. The Agency often projects risks from management that reasonably 

could

 be employed. 

a. Factors for Projecting a Plausible Waste Management Scenario. There are a number of disposal scenarios for wastes
not hazardous under RCRA that are common across industries. These include municipal and industrial unlined landfills
for solid materials, tanks and unlined surface impoundments for liquids, and boilers for organic solids and liquids.
The Agency will presume that these scenarios are plausible unless circumstances unique to a particular industry
show that one or more is not plausible for that industry. 

The Agency notes that there may exist certain disposal scenarios not common across industries that could present
a greater risk than the risk from the common plausible management scenarios mentioned above. An example might be land-spreading
sludge from wastewater treatment facilities. These less common scenarios generally will be considered plausible
only when information on an industry indicates that these disposal methods currently are being practiced, or there
is good reason to believe they might be practiced in the future. 

In determining whether one of the common disposal scenarios is not plausible, the Agency will consider factors such
as the following: 

 Availability of waste management practices. 

There may be practical constraints to the type of waste management practices available to a category of waste generators.
For example, if facilities in an industry have only a limited amount of land available to them, then building large
surface impoundments to handle wastewaters may be highly unlikely and would not be considered plausible. 

 Coverage of the Characterization Program. 

Where all, or at least a large percentage, of facilities in an industrial category can be characterized with respect
to waste management practices, the Agency may be able to do a more refined analysis of the plausibility of facilities
switching from their current waste management practice to a higher risk waste management practice. The Agency may
determine it more appropriate to estimate risk based on current management practices where our analysis shows that
it is unlikely that facilities would switch to another management practice. 

 Effect of Other Regulatory Programs. 

Other regulatory programs, for example, the water pollution control program or air pollution regulatory requirements,
can impose legal, technical, or practical restraints on waste management practices. If these requirements restrict
certain practices (

e.g.

, water treatment requirements technically and practically might preclude treatment in surface impoundments)
the Agency can use this information to consider eliminating that disposal practice from consideration.

<TEXT>
 

 Management Costs. 

Often, the cost of different management scenarios can be a determinative factor in dictating the plausibility of
waste management scenarios. In the absence of other potential cost factors, such as liability, the plausibility
that a facility would choose a waste management scenario increases as the expense of that management practice decreases.
Conversely, it is more implausible to assume that a firm would chose management activities that impose a higher cost
(where cost includes the likelihood of future potential liabilities.) Cost can be a consideration the Agency uses
in choosing which management scenario to project as a scenario to analyze for determining potential risk of waste
management. 

These factors are presented as examples; there may be others appropriate to specific industries. In characterizing
the risks for a wastestream where more than one disposal scenario is plausible, the Agency will use the results of the
risk assessment for the plausible scenario that presents the highest risks. 

Note that EPA considers the extent to which the plausible management scenario calculated to cause the highest risk
is practiced, or could be practiced. Management practices the Agency believes probably would occur infrequently
may be less determinative in the final listing determination process. As the probability that generators would use
a management practice increases, the greater the weight that set of risk values has in the final listing determination.




2. Risk Levels in Making Listing Decisions 



As noted earlier, the Agency's listing determination policy utilizes a ``weight-of-evidence'' approach in which
risk is a key factor. Risk measurements used include carcinogen risk, non-carcinogen risk as determined by hazard
quotient (HQ), and ecological risk. However, risk levels themselves do not necessarily represent the sole basis
for a listing. There can be uncertainty in calculated risk values and so other factors are considered in conjuction
with risk in making a listing decision. 

a. Use of Risk Levels in a Listing Decision. EPA's current listing determination procedure (illustrated in Figure
1) uses as an initial cancer-risk ``level of concern'' a calculated risk level of 1  x  10

^5

 (one in one hundred thousand) and/or HQs (and/or environmental risk quotients [EQs]) of 1 at any one point in time.
Note that individual risks can occur at different points in time. For example, a category of wastestream that is both
burned in a boiler by one facility but placed in a landfill by another would be projected to cause exposure through both
the air and the drinking water pathways. It is likely that risks from each source will occur at different times, since
air exposures would probably occur sooner than groundwater exposures. The Agency will take the timing factor into
account when analyzing risk. In accordance with EPA policy, risks from individual carcinogens generally are added
together. Listing decisions from this risk level of concern generally will be as follows.




















(1) Wastestreams for which the calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level is 1  x  10

^5

 or higher generally are considered initial candidates for a list decision. 

(2) Wastestreams for which these risks are calculated to be 1  x  10

^4

 or higher, or 1 or higher HQs or EQs for any individual non-carcinogen, or non-carcinogens that elicit adverse effects
on the same target organ, generally will be considered to pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health
and the environment and generally will be listed as hazardous waste. Such wastestreams fall into a category presumptively
assumed to pose sufficient risk to require their listing as hazardous waste. However, even for these wastestreams
there can in some cases be factors which could mitigate the high hazard presumption. These additional factors, explained
below, also will be considered by the Agency in making a final determination. 

(3) Wastestreams for which the calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level is lower than 1  x  10

^5

 generally are considered initial candidates for a no-list decision. 

(4) Wastestreams for which these risks are calculated to be 1  x  10

^6

 or lower, and lower than 1.0 HQs or EQs for any non-carcinogens, generally will be considered not to pose a substantial
present or potential hazard to human health and the environment and generally will not be listed as hazardous waste.
Such wastestreams fall into a category presumptively assumed not to pose sufficient risk as to require their listing
as hazardous waste. However, even for these wastestreams, in some cases, there can be factors that could mitigate
the low hazard presumption. These also will be considered by the Agency in making a final determination.

<TEXT>
 

(5) Wastestreams where the calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level is between 1 x 10

^4

 and 1 x 10

^6

 fall in the 
category for which there is a 
presumption of candidacy for either 
listing (risk >10

^5

) or no listing 
(risk <10

^5

). However, this 
presumption is not as strong as 
when risks are outside this range. 
Therefore, listing determinations 
for wastestreams falling into this 
range would always involve 
assessment of the additional 
factors discussed below. 

b. Additional Factors.

The following factors will be considered in making listing determinations, particularly 
for wastes falling into the risk range between 1 x 10

^4

 and 1 x 10

^6

: 

(1) Certainty of waste characterization; 

(2) Certainty in risk assessment methodology;

(3) Coverage by other regulatory programs; 

(4) Waste volume; 

(5) Evidence of co-occurrence; 

(6) Damage cases showing actual impact to human health or the environment; and 

(7) Presence of toxicant(s) of unknown or unquantifiable risk. 



(1) Certainty of Waste Characterization 



EPA compiles data on the amounts and composition of each wastestream. Different sources 
of variability in these data, variability between facilities, between production processes, 
between samples, and in analytical methodologies, exist. All such variability sources may 
influence the Agency's decision on how much weight to place on data collected as a basis for a 
listing decision. 

Budget constraints or sample availability constraints may limit the size of the database 
for any one wastestream. In such cases, the Agency generally assumes that the sample(s) taken 
are representative of each like wastestream from that category of generator and that the data, 
generated following a QA/QC plan, are ``good'' data. However, EPA will take uncertainty of the 
data into account in the listing process. 

The Agency sometimes relies on analytical measurements that fall below the level of an 
analyst's ability to quantify with certainty the concentration of the constituent involved 
(these measurements are referred to as ``estimated'' or ``J-values'' in listing determinations). 
Analytical methods used by the Agency have been developed with a goal of obtaining quantitative 
measurements (

i.e., 



#

25% uncertainty or less) at levels of regulatory concern. Frequently, 
analytical measurements may detect the presence of constituents of concern at levels at or 
below the analytical method's limit of quantitation. However, for some highly toxic substances 
measurements of constituents below the limit of quantitation may be of toxicological 
significance and, therefore, potential regulatory significance. 

The 

limit of quantitation

 is defined as the level above which results may be obtained with 
a specified degree of confidence. In the case of methods which use mass spectrometric 
measurements, quantitative uncertainty is assigned to measurements below the limit of 
quantitation (although a positive determination of presence is certain) as follows: 

 The uncertainty of measurements at the limit of detection (3 times the standard 
deviation estimation [

s

]) approaches 

#

100% (3

s



#

3

s

). 

 At the point of reliable detection (6

s



#

3

s

), the uncertainty of measurement 
approaches 

#

50%. 

 In the area of accurate quantitation (10

s

 to 12

s

), uncertainty approaches 

#

30% to 


#

25%, based on the 99% confidence level of the measurement uncertainty. 

In other words, when the analyte signal is 10 or more times larger than the standard 
deviation of the measurements, there is a 99% probability that the true concentration of the 
analyte is 

#

30% of the calculated concentration.






Although the uncertainty of analytical measurements increases as the limit of detection is 
approached, the calculated concentrations obtained may represent the best available measurement 
of the analyte present. 

It is the Agency's policy on listing determinations that measurements in the range below 
the level of quantification but above the level of detection will be used at the reported 
quantitation level for risk analysis purposes. However, the Agency generally will consider the 
uncertainty associated with measurements below the quantitation level and assess the impact of 
that level of uncertainty on a listing decision. Increasing uncertainty of a measurement may 
increase the importance of other factors in making a listing determination. 



(2) Certainty in Risk Assessment Methodology 



Uncertainty can exist in the methodologies and data used to conduct both the toxicity 
assessments and the fate and transport exposure models employed in risk assessments. Toxicity 
assessment methods sometimes rely on animal or cellular models to predict a chemical's effect 
on humans or animals. Direct toxicity testing of a chemical is not always available. For some 
of these chemicals, structure/activity relationships can be used to predict the toxicity of the 
substance involved. In these cases, the Agency considers what degree of uncertainty can exist 
in that analysis when making listing determinations. Similarly, some fate/transport models 
make use of an increased amount of input data or can involve actual verification. For those 
models, uncertainty in exposure analysis is decreased. The Agency weighs the relative 
uncertainty of the predictive models when generating risk assessments and making listing 
determinations.

(3) Coverage by Other Regulatory Programs 



Listing decisions can be strongly influenced by the effect of other regulatory 
requirements on the wastestreams involved. Where another Federal or State program or other 
RCRA requirements clearly will provide the type of control needed to eliminate the risk 
associated with a certain type of waste management, a RCRA listing may be considered 
unnecessary or redundant. 

 Other Federal or State programs.

If other Federal or State programs clearly regulate risk associated with the 
wastestream, listing may not be necessary to eliminate risk. For example, if the Office 
of Air and Radiation within EPA has issued an NESHAP to control emissions of a 
constituent, it may be unnecessary to consider risk from inhalation of that constituent in 
making listing determinations. In some cases, another regulatory program may be in the 
process of developing such regulatory requirements. If this program is under statutory 
requirements or Court Order, EPA may consider these regulatory requirements to be 
forthcoming and, in some cases, may defer to them in listing determinations, even where 
such regulatory coverage is several years away. If this program is under no statutory or 
legal deadline, no deference typically will be given to projected future regulatory 
coverage from other programs. 



(4) Waste Volume 



Waste volume is, in fact, part of a risk-level calculation. Risk is projected based on 
the volume of waste involved. However, volume of waste is also a factor EPA may consider when 
the projected risk falls in a marginal risk range. 



(5) Evidence of Co-occurrence 



Virtually all wastestreams EPA assesses are complex mixtures of constituents. Where 
possible, the Agency calculates potential risk for all measured pollutants. Where more than 
one risk value for carcinogenicity is calculated, concern about overall wastestream effects 
increases and the Agency will consider that risk additive. However, where sampling and 
analysis data show compelling evidence that the constituents cannot or do not occur together in 
the wastestream or at the receptor, the Agency generally will only consider the risk associated 
with individual constituents. 



(6) Damage Cases 



For each listing determination, EPA seeks data on damage cases. These are cases in which 
some prior waste management practice has resulted in environmental harm. Where there has been 
a clear case of harm, the data suggest the management of that waste has already damaged human 
health or the environment in some way, and that such damage could occur again. Depending on 
the number and severity of the damage cases and the potential for these damages to happen 
again, adverse damage cases may provide a ``stand alone'' reason for listing the waste. 

Where damage cases appear to contradict the risk analysis, EPA will try to determine the 
reason and use that assessment in the overall listing decision. 



(7) Unknown or Unquantified Risk 



Not all constituents in a complex wastestream can be analyzed for risk. Hazard data may 
not be available either directly or through mechanisms such as structure/activity 
relationships, or they may be in a form which is not considered usable by EPA. In the cases 
where some constituents are present but no risk levels can be assigned to them, the Agency 
considers the potential for these constituents to be hazardous.

As stated above, use of these additional factors is not limited to cases in which the risk 
levels fall between 10

^4

. Pursuant to EPA's listing determination policy ``weight-of-evidence'' approach, the Agency will consider these
factors, as appropriate, even where risk levels 
fall in the presumptive list or presumptive no-list levels. 



II. Today's Action 



A. Summary of Today's Action 



1. Confidentiality Claims 



The hazardous waste listings proposed here are based in part upon data claimed as confidential 
by certain dye and pigment manufacturers. Although EPA intends to publish information derived from 
these data claimed as confidential (to the extent relevant to the proposed listing), the Agency is 
unable to do so at the present time. Therefore, this proposed rule is being published without some 
of the information that supports the Agency's proposal. Where that information is missing from 
text, it is noted in the text. Whenever EPA is unable to include pertinent data in a table, the 
following statement appears in a footnote: ``Relevant data are not included at the present time due 
to business confidentiality concerns.'' EPA is pursuing avenues to allow publication of the 
information, and intends to supplement the public record prior to issuing a final listing.

In today's notice, EPA is proposing to add five wastes generated during the production of dyes and pigments to the lists
of hazardous wastes in 40 CFR 261.32. A summary of the waste groupings proposed for listing are provided below with
their proposed corresponding EPA Hazardous Waste Numbers.




K162 Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo pigments.

K163 Wastewaters from the production of azo pigments. 

K164 Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants. 

K165 Wastewaters from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants. 

K166 Still bottoms or heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments. 



The Agency has determined that these wastes meet the criteria for listing set out in 40 CFR 261.11. Section II.E. of
this preamble presents waste characterization, waste management, and risk assessment data, which are the bases
for the Agency's proposal to list or not to list the wastes studied in this rulemaking. 

Upon promulgation of these proposed listings, all wastes meeting the listing descriptions would become hazardous
wastes and would require treatment, storage, or disposal at permitted facilities. Residuals from the treatment,
storage, or disposal of the wastes included in this proposed listing also would be classified as hazardous wastes
pursuant to the ``derived-from'' rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)). For example, ash or other residuals from treatment
of the listed wastes would be subject to the hazardous waste regulations. Also, 40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv) (the ``mixture''
rule) provides that, with certain limited exceptions, any mixture of a listed waste and a solid waste is itself a RCRA
hazardous waste. 

However, when these wastes are recycled as described in 40 CFR 261.2(e)(1)(iii) or 261.4(a)(8), they are not solid
wastes and are not subject to hazardous waste regulations. For example, if a waste is collected and returned in a closed-loop
fashion to the same process, the waste is not 
regulated. To meet the exemption, the manner in which a material is recycled must meet the three key requirements outlined
in the rules and in 50 FR 639 (January 4, 1985): (1) The material must be returned to the original process from which it
was generated without first being reclaimed; (2) the production process to which the materials are returned must
use raw materials as principal feedstocks; and (3) the material must be returned as a substitute for raw material feedstock
in the original production process. (The regulations contain other recycling exclusions as well, but the provisions
referenced above are the principal ones most likely to be applicable to the wastes at issue in this proposal.) EPA is
proposing to amend Appendix VII and Appendix VIII to 40 CFR part 261 to add constituents contained in the above wastestreams
which were found to pose risk. 

The Agency requests comments on the proposed listing of the above wastes, and on the option of not listing these wastes.


This action also proposes not to list as hazardous six wastestreams generated during the production of dyes and pigments:

 Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding 
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock). 

 Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline 
as a feedstock. 

 Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. 

 Wastewaters from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments. 

 Wastewaters from the production of FD&C colorants. 

 Dusts and dust collector fines from the manufacture of dyes and pigments. 

The Agency requests comments on the proposal not to list the above wastes and on the option of listing these wastes.


Because the Agency does not have sufficient sampling information on which to base a proposed listing determination,
the Agency proposes to defer a determination of whether to list wastewater treatment sludge from the production of
triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock), as well as spent
filter aids, diatomaceous earth, or adsorbents from azo, anthraquinone, or triarylmethane dyes, pigments, or FD&C
colorants. The Agency intends to obtain such sampling information and issue a supplemental notice making a proposed
determination on whether to list the wastes as hazardous. The Agency also is deferring a proposed listing determination
for wastewater treatment sludge from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments due to lack of health effects
information on two constituents, leucoquinizarine and 1-aminoanthraquinone, that were found in the wastestream.
The Agency requests any information 
that commenters may have on the toxicology of these constituents, including the existence of any toxic analogs for
leucoquinizarine and 1-aminoanthraquinone. EPA will evaluate carefully all public comments and information received
in response to this notice. Particular notice will be paid to any data which tend to support or refute a finding of risk
to human health and the environment. Based on comments received, EPA may choose, rather than deferring, to promulgate
a final determination to either list or not list wastewater treatment sludge from the production of anthraquinone
dyes and 
pigments as hazardous under RCRA. 

The Agency also requests comments on the data used in this proposal, the methodology and assumptions used in the risk
assessment, the waste groupings chosen by the Agency and other analyses supporting the proposed listings. 



3. Request for Comment on the Effect of Enforceable EPA/Industry Agreements on Plausible Mismanagement Analysis
and Subsequent Listing Determinations 



The Agency is interested in innovative ways of conducting listing determinations that could assure environmental
protection with less cost than full regulation as a hazardous waste. One approach on which the Agency seeks comment
involves enforceable agreements between EPA and the regulated community. 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941222-1-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Agency is seeking comment on whether enforceable agreements between EPA and industry that 
restrict the use of certain waste management practices could affect the Agency's plausible 
mismanagement analysis and, in turn, affect the Agency's listing determination. Specifically, the 
Agency seeks comment on whether EPA should pursue such agreements with respect to either the dye and 
pigment wastes that the Agency is proposing to list in this notice (or, additionally those it 
proposes not to list). The Agency seeks comment on whether the Agency should decide not to list 
such wastes (or retain a no-list decision) if the agreements ensure that the wastes will not be 
managed in a manner that poses unacceptable risk. 

A decision not to list based on such enforceable agreements could be based on the view that 
management practices that are prohibited in an enforceable agreement are not ``plausible'' because 
facilities within an industry covered by an enforceable agreement are unlikely to violate that 
agreement; 

i.e.

, use a risky management practice, especially if the agreement were to contain 
monetary or other sanctions for a breach or violation. Waste management practices that are not 
plausible because they are prohibited by such an agreement arguably need not be considered by the 
Agency in determining whether the waste poses ``a substantial present or potential hazard to human 
health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise 
managed.'' (

See 

discussion of selection of waste management scenarios at I.B.1.) Thus, if a waste 
does not pose an unacceptable risk if managed in accordance with an enforceable agreement, the 
Agency could determine that the waste should not be listed as hazardous. The Agency requests 
comment on the use of such an approach as part of the listing determination for wastes generated 
during the production of dyes and pigments, including those proposed to be listed and/or proposed 
not to be listed in today's notice. 

For such an approach to be workable, the EPA believes that the following basic principles must 
apply: 

(1) All of the companies that generate the wastestream at issue must be party to the 
agreement; 

(2) To ensure that the agreement will adequately deter prohibited waste management practices, 
the agreement should be enforceable in court and should contain provisions requiring 
payment of sufficient penalties or damages if the agreement is violated; 

(3) The agreement should eliminate management practices that pose an unacceptable risk; 

(4) The agreement should contain provisions that would account for new entrants; and 

(5) The agreement should promote waste minimization. 

Section 7003 of RCRA may provide EPA with authority under appropriate circumstances to enter 
into such agreements on consent. Section 7003(a) of RCRA authorizes EPA to issue orders requiring 
such action as may be necessary upon receipt of evidence that the past or present handling, storage, 
treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid waste or hazardous waste may present an imminent 
and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment. EPA also has the authority to 
settle claims under RCRA section 7003 by entering into a consent decree or agreement. In addition, 
the Agency has inherent authority to enter into contracts that are not prohibited by law. See 
generally, 

Kern-Limerick, Inc. 

v. 

Scurlock, 

347 U.S. 110 (1954). Such inherent authority also may 
be available to enter into such agreements. 

EPA believes that such an approach may be feasible for the wastes generated during the 
production of dyes and pigments because such wastes are generated by a relatively small number of 
facilities, and the likelihood of expansion in this industry does not appear to be great. Such an 
approach may not be feasible in an industry with a greater number of facilities or in an industry 
that is expanding. Additionally, it may not be a valid approach for an industrial sector in which 
the wastes generated are so hazardous, move off-site in such a fashion, or require such detailed 
controls that EPA wants the full regulatory controls and civil and criminal authorities that follow 
from full Subtitle C regulation. 

The Agency requests comments on the feasibility of entering into and enforcing such agreements 
with industry. The Agency also requests comment on how such agreements would account for entrance 
into the market of new facilities that generate the waste at issue (

e.g.

, add new elements to the 
agreement, issue unilateral order under RCRA Section 7003). The Agency also requests comment on 
alternative innovative approaches to listing determinations.

B. Dye and Pigment Industries Overview 



The dye and pigment industries are comprised of three separate industries, 
represented by three different trade associations. The Color Pigment Manufacturers 
Association (CPMA) represents pigment manufacturers, the Ecological and Toxicological 
Association of the Dyestuffs Manufacturing Industry (ETAD) represents dye manufacturers, 
and the International Association of Color Manufacturers (IACM) represents food, drug, and 
cosmetic (FD&C) colorants manufacturers. 

Dyes are intensely colored or fluorescent organic substances that impart color to a 
substrate by selective absorption of light.
 When a dye is applied, it penetrates the 
substrate in a soluble form, after which it may or may not become insoluble. Dyes are 
retained in the substrate by physical absorption, salt or metal-complex formation, 
solution, mechanical retention, or by the formation of ionic or covalent chemical bonds.
 






Dyes are used to color fabrics, leather, paper, ink, lacquers, varnishes, plastics, 
cosmetics, and some food items. Dye manufacture in the U.S. includes more than 2,000 
individual dyes, the majority of which are produced in quantities of less than 50,000 
pounds. In 1990, total U.S. dye production was 258 million pounds. In 1991, there were 
approximately 33 manufacturing plants operated by 20 companies that produce either azo, 
anthraquinone, or triarylmethane dyes.






Pigments possess unique characteristics that distinguish them from dyes and other 
colorants. Pigments are colored, black, white, or fluorescent particulate organic or 
inorganic solids, usually insoluble in, and essentially physically and chemically 
unaffected by, the vehicle or substrate in which they are incorporated. The primary 
difference between pigments and dyes is that during the application process, pigments are 
insoluble in the substrate. Pigments also retain a crystalline or particulate structure 
and impart color by selective absorption or by scattering of light. With dyes, the 
structure is temporarily altered during the application process, and imparts color only by 
selective absorption.
 





Pigments are used in a variety of applications; the primary use is in printing inks. 
There are fewer pigments produced than dyes, though pigment batches are generally larger 
in size. The U.S. total 1990 pigment production volume of approximately 415 million 
pounds is composed of 300 million pounds of inorganic pigments and 115 million pounds of 
organic pigments.
 In 1991, there were approximately 27 domestic manufacturing plants 
operated by 20 companies
 producing organic pigments subject to the settlement agreement. 







FD&C colorants are dyes and pigments that have been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for use in food items, drugs, and/or cosmetics. Typically, FD&C 
colorants are azo or triarylmethane dyes and are similar or identical to larger-volume dye 
products not used in food, drugs, and cosmetics. Manufacture of FD&C colorants is 
identical to that for the corresponding dye or pigment, except that the colorant undergoes 
additional purification. Each FD&C colorant batch is tested and certified by the FDA. In 
1991, there were approximately 7 domestic manufacturing plants operated by 5 companies
 producing FD&C colorants subject to the EDF settlement agreement. 





This proposal addresses the three chemical classes of organic dyes and pigments 
specified in the settlement agreement: azos, anthraquinones, and triarylmethanes. 

Azos are the largest and most versatile chemical class. The various azo chemical 
structures are readily synthesized, typical product application methods are not complex, 
and a broad range of colors can be produced with excellent fastness properties. Azo 
colorants are used in essentially all organic dye applications, including textiles, paper, 
inks, coatings, plastics, and leather. 

Pyrazolones are a subset of azo dyes and 
pigments, named for the substituted pyrazolones that are used as coupling agents. The 
pyrazolone subclass is comprised mainly of yellow, orange, and red azo dyes and pigments. 

Pyrazolone dyes and pigments are used primarily in textiles and plastics, respectively. 

Despite high costs, anthraquinones are an important group of dyes due to superior 
fastness. They have applications on cotton, cellulose, and synthetic fibers. They have 
good affinity for the substrate, level dyeing power, and excellent fastness. 
Anthraquinone pigments are chemically identical to the corresponding dyestuffs and also 
exhibit high fastness properties. They are used primarily in automotive paints. There 
are many more anthraquinone dyes than pigments. Most anthraquinone dyes have not been 
developed into pigments due to technical constraints, as well as competition from less 
expensive substitutes. 

Perylene pigments, a subset of the anthraquinone chemical class, provide an 
economical alternative to heavy metal-containing red pigments. Their excellent thermal 
stability and fastness properties meet the standards for automotive finishes and other 
high-quality coatings. 

Triarylmethanes are characterized by their brilliancy of hue, intensity of color, and 
low fastness properties. Triarylmethane dyes typically are used in the textile industry 
and in the production of pigments. Pigments typically are used in the production of 
printing and duplicating inks.

C. Description of the Process Wastes Identified in Comparison to Those Specified in the Settlement Agreement



Based on the Agency's study of the dye and pigment industries, EPA has concluded that many of the dye and pigment processes
within each of the three chemical classes generate very similar wastestreams. Because of the similarity of wastestreams
associated with the manufacture of each class of dye or pigment (

i.e.,

 azo, anthraquinone, and triarylmethane), EPA combined closely related wastestreams into ``waste groupings,''
and proposed one hazardous waste listing description and waste code for each of these groupings. Although, given
time and resource constraints, EPA was not able to sample wastestreams generated from the production of each distinct
product within a particular waste grouping, the sampling data and raw material and process chemistry information
that EPA collected support the waste groupings EPA has established.

The constituents and their concentrations in a waste will determine, in turn, the nature of the toxicity of the waste.
EPA is required to consider the nature and toxicity of a waste in making listing determinations pursuant to 40 CFR 261.11.
Given that similarities between wastes will result in a similar listing determination pursuant to the factors in
EPA's regulations, it is reasonable to group wastes for the purpose of making listing determinations. Further, grouping
similar waste matrices (

i.e.,

 wastewaters or sludges) will facilitate the development of land disposal treatment standards (see 40 CFR part 268).

Listing determinations were made on each waste grouping. For example, all wastewaters resulting from the production
of azo pigments are proposed to be listed as K163 hazardous wastes. Other wastewater groupings for which listing determinations
were made include wastewaters resulting from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants (proposed
as K165), wastewaters resulting from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments, and wastewaters resulting
from the production of FD&C colorants.

In addition, wastewaters generated from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments are grouped together
under one waste grouping due to the similarity of these wastes, with the exception of wastewaters from the production
of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments
using aniline as a feedstock were found to be significantly different in chemical composition from other triarylmethane
dye and pigment processes and, therefore, were placed in a separate waste grouping.

Triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock are manufactured at two facilities in the country. Only two
triarylmethane products are made at each of these facilities and one is used as an intermediate for the second. The
process used in manufacturing these pigments is a batch process but is operated throughout the year. Only two primary
reactants are used at these facilities, unlike other dye and pigment operations where hundreds of raw materials often
are used at one site. As a result, these reactants are present in the wastewater at high concentrations.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941222-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Thus, wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments were divided into two categories for purposes
of making a listing determination: (1) Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments, excluding
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock, and (2) wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane
pigments using aniline as a feedstock.

The wastewater categories include mother liquors generated from product filtration, filter washwaters, equipment
and floor cleaning washwaters, break waters, spent scrubber waters, and other process waters. Treated wastewater
effluent also is captured by these wastewater groupings. Although EPA did not sample wastewater following treatment,
treated wastewater would be expected to contain the same or fewer hazardous constituents and the same or lower concentrations
of such constituents than untreated wastewater. Thus, if not listed before treatment, such wastewater is presumed
not to meet the Agency's criteria for listing after treatment. Furthermore, any wastewater listed as hazardous before
treatment would continue to be regulated as hazardous waste after treatment.

Wastewater treatment sludges were grouped in a similar manner to wastewaters. Wastewater treatment sludges generated
from the dye and pigment industries include any sludges generated during the pretreatment or treatment of dye and
pigment wastewaters. This includes pretreatment sludge generated from filtration and precipitation in equalization
and neutralization basins, sludges from powdered activated carbon or other adsorbent treatments, and primary and
secondary biological treatment sludges. Sludge groupings defined for purposes of listing determinations include
wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo pigments (proposed as K162), wastewater treatment sludge
from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants (proposed as K164), wastewater treatment sludge from
the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments, wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane
dyes and pigments, excluding triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock, and wastewater treatment sludge
from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. These groupings are justified because,
as was true within the wastewater grouping, the sludges covered by each sludge waste group exhibit similarities in
constituent concentrations.

Distillation bottoms from dye and pigment manufacturing are generated during raw material and solvent recovery
operations. The Agency determined that still bottoms from dye and pigment manufacturing are generated only during
recovery operations associated with the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and pigments. Therefore, the following
waste grouping was developed to address distillation bottoms from the dye and pigment industries: Still bottoms
or heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments (proposed as K166).

The Agency grouped spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth, or adsorbents used in the production of azo, anthraquinone,
or triarylmethane dyes, pigments, or FD&C colorants into one waste grouping because these wastes all adsorb
unreacted raw materials, by-products, and impurities and are generated in physically similar forms. Because the
constituent composition of these filter aids varies depending on raw materials used, the Agency does not, at this
time, have sufficient data to fully characterize this waste grouping. To further support a listing determination
on these wastestreams, the Agency intends to collect additional information which will allow assessment of these
wastes either as a single waste grouping or, alternatively, as several separate groupings.

Dusts and dust collector fines are generated primarily during drying, grinding, and blending operations used in
manufacturing both dyes and pigments. These wastestreams were grouped because they all are comprised primarily
of product dust.

Product standardization filter cake probably is generated during a final purification step following product standardization.
Information obtained during the industry study does not confirm the existence or description of this wastestream.
However, filter cakes generated during product purification are comprised of spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth,
or other adsorbent, along with product impurities and, therefore, will be characterized with the spent filter aids
wastestream described above.

Information relevant to this discussion is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality concerns.

Therefore, the Agency is including the spent catalyst wastestreams with the spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth,
or adsorbents used in the manufacture of azo, anthraquinone, or triarylmethane dyes, pigments, or FD&C colorants
waste group. The Agency did not encounter any traditional catalysts (

i.e.,

 chemicals used to enhance a reaction without being consumed) used in dye and pigment manufacturing.

Vacuum system condensate, reactor still overhead, and equipment cleaning sludge, are not generated in dye and pigment
manufacturing.

The following table summarizes each of the wastestreams identified in the settlement agreement, and describes their
coverage in the listing determinations proposed in today's rulemaking:

D. Description of Health and Risk Assessments 



In determining whether waste generated from the production of dyes and pigments meets 
the criteria for listing a waste as hazardous as set out at 40 CFR 261.11, the Agency 
evaluated the potential toxicity and intrinsic hazard of constituents present in the 
wastestreams, the fate and mobility of these chemicals, the likely exposure routes, the 
current waste management practices, and plausible management practices. A quantitative 
risk assessment was conducted for those constituents and wastestreams where the available 
information made such an assessment possible. 



1. Human Health Criteria and Effects 



The Agency uses health-based levels, or HBLs, as a means for evaluating the level of 
concern of toxic constituents in various media. In the development of HBLs, EPA first 
must determine exposure levels that are protective of human health and then apply standard 
exposure assumptions to develop media-specific levels. EPA uses the following hierarchy 
for evaluating health effects data and health-based standards in establishing chemical-specific HBLS: 

a. Use the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) or proposed MCL (PMCL) as the HBL for 
the ingestion of the constituent in water, when it exists. MCLs are promulgated 
under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SWDA) of 1974, as amended in 1986, and 
consider technology and economic feasibility as well as health effects. 


b. Use Agency-verified Reference Doses (RfDs) or Reference Concentrations (RfCs) in 
calculating HBLs for noncarcinogens and verified carcinogenic slope factors 
(CSFs) in calculating HBLs for carcinogens. Agency-verified RfDs, RfCs, and 
CSFs and the bases for these values are presented in the EPA's Integrated Risk 
Information System (IRIS).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941222-1-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. Use RfDs, RfCs, or CSFs that are calculated by standard methods but not verified by the Agency. These values can be
found in a number of different types of Agency documents and EPA uses the following hierarchy when reviewing these
documents: Health Effects Assessment Summary Tables (HEAST); Human Health Assessment Group for Carcinogens; Health
Assessment Summaries (HEAs) and Health and Environmental Effects Profiles (HEEPs); and Health and Environmental
Effects Documents (HEEDs). 

d. Use RfDs or CSFs that are calculated by alternative methods, such as surrogate analysis, including structure activity
analysis, and toxicity equivalency. 

All HBLs and their bases for this listing determination are provided in a document entitled ``Dye and Pigment Waste
Listing Support Health Effects Background Document'' (RTI,1994), which can be found in the RCRA docket for this rule
at EPA Headquarters (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). 

Acute toxicity data such as lethal doses for the oral and dermal routes and lethal concentrations for the inhalation
route also were evaluated for all analytes in the record samples. These data also are presented in the Health Effects
Background Document prepared for this rule. 



Use of Metabolic Products 



There are three compounds commonly identified in the record samples for which EPA has found no reliable health effects
data. These compounds are: Acetoacet-

o

-anisidide (AAOA), acetoacet-

o

-toluidide (AAOT), and acetoacetanilide (AAA). Because of the lack of health effects data on these compounds, the
Agency explored the use of metabolic pathway information to develop toxicologic values. This approach involves
the use of health effects information for compounds expected to follow a similar metabolic pathway to those of the
three chemicals of concern to estimate toxicity. 

The metabolic pathways for the class of compounds identified as aromatic amines have been extensively studied, and
acetylation and N-hydroxylation have been identified as initial metabolic reactions of this class of compounds.
Using this information, the Agency proposes to use the toxicity of aniline to represent the toxicity of AAA and the
toxicity of 2-aminotoluene to represent the toxicity of AAOA and AAOT. The Agency has assumed a direct quantitative
relationship between the constituents of concern (

i.e.

, AAOA, AAOT, AAA) and these compounds (

i.e.

, aniline, 2-aminotoluene) that follow a similar metabolic route. 

In humans as much as 60 percent of aniline that is absorbed is oxidized in a dose-dependent manner to give 

o

- and 

p

-aminophenol, the first step in amide formation for this pathway. The metabolites of these products include acetylated
arylamines, and are responsible for the toxicity of aniline. 

Acetoacetanilide (AAA) is a structural analog of aniline and the metabolic pathways are expected to be similar. Since
the acetyl group is already part of AAA, initial acetylation may be considered complete. 

Because the metabolic conversions occur on a molar basis and the doses in laboratory studies are reported as parts
per million, the difference in molecular weight must be considered. Also, since only 60 percent of the aniline is expected
to be metabolized by the acetylation pathway and AAA is acetylated in its original form, the toxicity of AAA is expected
to be proportionally greater than the toxicity of aniline. Therefore, the HBL for AAA is estimated to be 0.003 mg/L
as compared to 0.006 mg/L for aniline. 

Acetoacet-

o

-toluidide (AAOT), and acetoacet-

o

-anisidide (AAOA) are structural analogues of 2-aminotoluene, and the metabolic pathways are expected to be similar
to those previously described for aniline. Since the acetyl group is already part of AAOT and AAOA, initial acetylation
may be considered complete. 

Because the metabolic conversions occur on a molar basis and the doses in laboratory studies are reported as parts
per million, the difference in molecular weight must be considered. Also, since only 25 percent of the aminotoluene
is expected to be metabolized by the acetylation pathway, and AAOT and AAOA are acetylated in their original forms,
their toxicities are expected to be proportionally greater than the toxicity of 2-aminotoluene. Therefore, the
HBLs for AAOT and AAOA are estimated to be 0.00004 mg/L and 0.00005 mg/L, respectively, as compared to 0.0001 mg/L for
2-aminotoluene. 

2-Methoxyaniline also has been identified in the azo pigment wastestream. 2-Aminotoluene has been selected as the
surrogate for the toxicity of 2-methoxyaniline, because of the structural similarity of the compounds and the similarity
of metabolic mechanisms described above. The Agency requests comment on the use of metabolic pathway information
to determine health effects, and on alternate approaches. 



2. Coeluting Compounds 



A number of compounds detected in the wastes generated from dye and pigment manufacture coelute (

i.e., 

overlap) on the Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) curve, making it impossible to confirm the concentration
and, in some cases, the presence of the individual coeluting compounds. For example, the three constituents, 2- and
4-aminoaniline, and 2-methoxyaniline, coelute on the GC/MS curve. The coelution is such that the presence of 2- and
4-aminoaniline is indistinguishable, yet the presence of 2- methoxyaniline can be verified. This occurs because
the curve for 2-methoxyaniline contains an extra peak in addition to the peaks that overlap with 2- and 4-aminoaniline.
However, the individual contributions to the total concentration found in the waste can not be established. 

Because the contributions from the individual contaminants can not be established, the Agency assumed that any of
the three contaminants could be present at 100 percent of the concentration detected. The Agency evaluated all coeluting
compounds independently in the risk assessment and used the highest risk calculated for the compounds to ensure the
risk was not underestimated. 

However, 2-methoxyaniline is the expected contaminant in wastes generated from facilities that manufacture azo
pigments using acetoacet-

o

-anisidide (AAOA) as a raw material because 2-methoxyaniline is an expected hydrolysis product of AAOA (refer to
Section II.E, Wastewater Treatment Sludge from the Production of Azo Pigments, K162, for a discussion on the hydrolysis
of AAOA). Therefore, for wastes generated from the manufacture of azo pigments using AAOA as a raw material, the Agency
conducted the risk assessment for these coeluting compounds based on toxicity information for 2-methoxyaniline
(see discussion of metabolic products, above, and the Dye and Pigment Waste Listing Support Health Effects Background
Document for discussions on the toxicity surrogate used for 2-methoxyaniline).

A second set of coeluting compounds consists of the three isomers 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene. The presence of the three
isomers was confirmed when detected, and the combined concentration of the three compounds was quantified. Because
the contributions from the individual contaminants can not be established, any one of the coeluting contaminants
could be present at 100 percent of the concentration detected. Therefore, the Agency evaluated coeluting compounds
with health-based levels independently in the risk assessment and used the highest risk calculated by the constituents,
in this case 2-aminotoluene, to ensure that risk was not underestimated. The volume of 2-aminotoluene consumed as
a raw material, based on 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, is approximately 9 times that of the other isomers.
In addition, aromatic amines with substitutions in the 2- and 4- positions of the aromatic ring are used in the manufacture
of azo dyes much more frequently than those substituted in the 3- position. Therefore, any impurities or breakdown
products from aromatic amines are likely to be substituted in the 2- and 4- positions. 

1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene also coelute on the GC/MS curve. Both compounds are likely oxidation products
of aniline, and may be present in the waste as reaction by-products. In addition to the uncertainty in establishing
concentrations for each of the two compounds, the chemical pathway from aniline to these oxidation products suggests
that either contaminant may be present at all or part of the concentration detected. The Agency evaluated these coeluting
compounds independently and used the highest risk calculated by the compounds to ensure the risk was not underestimated.


As with azobenzene and 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, diphenylamine and N-nitrosodiphenylamine coelute on the GC/MS
curve and are likely by-products resulting from the oxidation of aniline. As stated above, the Agency evaluated these
coeluting compounds independently and used the highest risk calculated by the compounds to ensure the risk was not
underestimated. 

The Agency requests comments on the approach used to assess risk when compounds that coelute were detected in the wastestream,
and on alternative approaches that commenters may develop. 



3. Risk Analysis 
Risk Characterization Approach 



The risk characterization approach follows the recent EPA Guidance on Risk Characterization (Habicht, 1992) and
Guidance for Risk Assessment (EPA Risk Assessment Council, 1991). The guidance specifies that EPA risk assessments
will be expected to include (1) the central tendency and high-end portions of the risk distribution, and (2) important
subgroups of the populations such as highly susceptible groups or individuals, if known. In addition to the presentation
of results, the guidance also specifies that the results portray a reasonable picture of the actual or projected exposures
with a discussion of uncertainties. These documents are available in the public docket for this action (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). 



Individual Risk 



Individual risk descriptors are intended to convey information about the risk borne by individuals within a specified
population and subpopulations. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the affected population,
and the risk for individuals within a population of interest. The approach used in this analysis for characterizing
baseline individual risk included: (1) Identifying and describing the population of concern for an exposure route;
(2) determining the sensitivity of the model parameters used in the risk estimation; (3) estimating central tendency
and high-end values for the most sensitive parameters in the risk estimation procedures; and (4) calculating individual
risk for likely exposure pathways that provides a characterization of the central tendency and high-end risk descriptor.




Risk Assessment 



The results of the risk assessment are presented in waste-specific risk tables in each of the basis for listing sections
(Section II.E.). The risk tables include the following information: Constituents of concern; estimated human health
risk associated with the current and plausible management scenarios; high, low, and average concentrations of constituents
found in this wastestream; the number of samples in which the constituent was detected; notes regarding ``J-values''
(see Section II.B on Data Uncertainties); and industry-submitted data. 

In addition to those compounds presented in the waste-specific risk tables, the Agency's characterization data
include a number of compounds identified as present in the waste but for which no health benchmarks exist. In addition,
other compounds which do have health benchmarks have been identified in these wastes but were dropped from further
consideration following the risk screening because the risks were projected to be below levels of concern. The risk
tables presented in this preamble do not contain these additional constituents. The complete list of constituents
found in each of the wastes generated from the manufacture of dyes and pigments, an explanation of the risk screening
process, and an explanation of EPA's development of the target analyte list are presented in the Listing and Health
Effects Background Documents for this proposed rule, which are located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (See


ADDRESSES 

section). 

The analysis of risk was developed using both the input of derived or measured toxicological information and the modeling
of exposure from baseline (or current) waste management practices and other plausible management scenarios. Pursuant
to the Agency's regulations on listing hazardous wastes, EPA considers the ``plausible types of improper management
to which the waste could be subjected'', 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(vii). Thus, plausible management is one of the waste
management scenarios used by EPA to assess the risks to human health and the environment from the disposal of the wastes
under consideration. 

The choice of ``plausible management'' depends on a combination of factors which are discussed in Section II.A, ``EPA's
Listing Determination Process.'' The following discussion explains the plausible management scenarios used to
assess risk for each of the waste groups addressed in this proposal. The Agency requests comment on its choice of plausible
management scenarios and on the possibility of using alternative plausible management scenarios.

Sludges and Other Solid Materials 



The plausible management scenario used to assess risks for the wastewater treatment 
sludges from the production of azo dyes and pigments (K162 and K164), and still bottoms or 
heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (K166) was disposal in 
an on-site monofill. Disposal in an on-site monofill for these waste categories results 
in the highest adverse exposure of sensitive individuals or populations. For wastewater 
treatment sludges from azo dye production (K164), this plausible management scenario 
(

i.e.

, on-site monofill) currently is practiced. 

The Agency determined that disposal in an on-site monofill is a plausible management 
scenario for wastewater treatment sludges from azo pigment production (K162) and still 
bottoms or heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (K166), for 
the following reasons: 

 On-site monofills have been used by industry to dispose of wastewater treatment 
sludge from the manufacture of dyes and pigments; 

 Most of the still bottoms generated from the production of triarylmethane dyes 
and pigments are high-volume wastestreams for which on-site monofills are a 
plausible management option; and 

 On-site monofills can be a lower-cost disposal option. 

Therefore, there is a potential for monofills to be constructed and used in the 
future, by either dye or pigment manufacturers to dispose of wastewater treatment sludges 
or other high-volume solid wastes. 

For wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using 
aniline as a feedstock, the plausible management was determined to be the current 
management, blending with non-hazardous fuel. Currently, 100% of this waste is sent off-
site for non-hazardous fuel blending. The Agency believes that this waste will continue 
to be managed in this manner because the relatively high organic content of the waste 
gives the material value as a fuel ingredient. Therefore, generators of the waste have an 
economic incentive to continue fuel blending. For comparison purposes, the Agency also 
projected the risks from managing this wastestream in a municipal landfill (from release 
of contaminants into ground water) and in an on-site boiler (from release of contaminants 
into the air). 

The primary exposure pathway considered from disposal of solid materials in both 
unlined municipal landfills (evaluated as the baseline management practice for K162, K164, 
and K166) and monofills (evaluated as plausible management practices for K162, K164, and 
K166) is direct ingestion of drinking water from residential wells near the disposal site. 
Because of the widespread practice of daily cover, indirect air pathways and surface 
erosion and runoff were not evaluated for municipal landfills. For on-site monofills, 
however, the presumption of no daily cover was used, and risks associated with indirect 
pathways were evaluated. 

In addition to estimating potential risks from waste disposed in an unlined municipal 
landfill, the Agency evaluated risks from municipal landfills meeting the minimum 
requirements for a Subtitle D landfill (56 FR 50978, 1991). These requirements include 
daily cover, flexible membrane liner, leachate collection system, clay liner, and final 
cap and cover. The results of these analyses can be found in the Risk Assessment for Dye 
and Pigment Waste Listing Determination. This document is available in the RCRA public 
docket (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). 

A dilution factor based on the ratio of the volume of the waste to the volume of co-
disposed municipal waste and daily cover was used to estimate the concentrations of the 
constituents of concern in the landfill. The concentrations of the constituents measured 
in the waste were multiplied by this dilution factor to determine the concentration of the 
constituents in the landfill. The concentrations of the constituents in the landfill 
leachate were estimated using Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) data 
submitted by industry for selected constituents (3,3
'-dichlorobenzidine, aniline, 4- 
chloroaniline, and 2- and 4-aminotoluene), or when TCLP data were not available, by using 
a soil-water partitioning equation. 

EPA used the following linear partition equation (Dragan, 1988) with an adjustment to 
relate sorbed concentration to total waste concentration. 




C

L

 = C

W

/[Foc * Koc + O * S/Bd] 





where C

L

=leachate concentration 

C

W

=waste concentration 

Foc=fraction organic carbon 

Koc=organic carbon partitioning coefficient 

O=porosity 

S=fraction water content 

Bd=bulk density 





The physical properties of the waste used in this equation (

i.e.

, bulk density, 
fraction organic carbon) were obtained either from the Agency's record samples when 
available, or from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire responses. 

The volume of leachate and rate of ground-water recharge were estimated using the 
HELP model. The HELP model uses site-specific precipitation values and standard 
assumptions for the characteristics of municipal waste to estimate infiltration and 
recharge rates. For the evaluation of dye and pigment wastes in municipal landfills, 
annual precipitation rates for sites near all dye and pigment facilities were ranked. 
Charlotte, North Carolina was selected as representative of the median precipitation value 
for the areas near dye and pigment facilities, and Charleston, South Carolina, was 
selected as representative of sites with high annual rainfall potential. The default 
meteorologic conditions for these locations in the HELP model were used to determine the 
infiltration and recharge rates used in the ground-water modeling.

The distance to the receptor wells near the municipal landfill used in the ground-water modeling were obtained from
the survey of well distances conducted for the Background Document for EPACML: Finite Source Methodology (EPA, 1992).
The value selected as representative of the average condition is the 50th-percentile value for well distance (438
m), and the value for the high-end (close) condition (48 m) is the 95th-percentile value. 

The Agency used the MULTIMED groundwater model to simulate the subsurface dilution and attenuation of the leachate
constituents in order to estimate the concentration of constituents at the hypothetical residential wells. The
Agency then calculated risks to an individual, assuming the residents using this well on average consume 1.4 L/day
of contaminated water, or 2 L/day for higher consumptions. Values of 9 or 30 years were used for the average and high-exposure
duration estimates. The formulae used and a more detailed discussion of the application of these models to the waste
samples can be found in the Risk Assessment for Dye and Pigment Waste Listing Determination, available in the RCRA
public docket (see 

ADDRESSES

 section). 

For on-site monofills, the leaching analysis was the same as for municipal landfills except that the waste concentrations
are not diluted in the monofill. 

The distance to the nearest receptor wells near the on-site landfill used in the ground-water modeling were obtained
from a telephone survey of 9 city planning offices and a review of site visit reports and site maps. The value selected
as representative of the average condition is the 50th-percentile value for well distance (163 m) and the value for
the high-end (close) condition (16 m) is the closest value. The Risk Assessment for Dye and Pigment Waste Listing Determination
for this rulemaking contains a more detailed discussion of these values. This document is available in the RCRA public
docket (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). 

In addition to direct ingestion of contaminated drinking water, additional pathways were evaluated depending on
the characteristics of the waste and management practices evaluated. These pathways included inhalation pathways
from airborne particulates and volatiles released from the monofills, and indirect exposure pathways such as the
ingestion of vegetables grown in soil contaminated by runoff from the on-site landfill and/or dermal exposure due
to direct contact with contaminated soil. The algorithms used for the estimation of risks due to indirect exposures
were taken from the Methodology for Assessing Health Risks Associated with Indirect Exposure to Combustion Emissions
(U.S. EPA, 1990) as modified by the September 24 draft of Addendum: Methodology for Assessing Health Risks Associated
with Indirect Exposure to Combustion Emissions. Working Group Recommendations (U.S. EPA, 1993) and the Risk Assessment
Guidance for Superfund (RAGS): Volume I_Human Health Evaluation Manual (Part B, Development of Risk-base Preliminary
Remediation Goals) (U.S. EPA, 1991), and Dermal Exposure Assessment: Principles and 
Applications. Interim Report (U.S. EPA 1992) for dermal exposures to water. These documents are available in the
public docket for this rule (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). 

The air pathways were evaluated using the CHEMDAT 7 air emission model to determine the emission rates for volatile
constituents from the landfill, tanks, and storage bins. The Fugitive Dust Model (FDM) was used to determine the emission
rates for particulates. These emissions were coupled with dispersion coefficients to determine the ambient air
concentrations and the rate of deposition of the waste constituents onto the nearby soil, vegetable gardens, watersheds,
and water bodies. The distances to air receptors are assumed to be similar to those used for the ground-water wells.
The meteorologic locations used for the air modeling were selected by a procedure similar to that used to select the
ground-water locations. The annual average wind speed, temperature, and precipitation values for 34 sites near
dye and pigment facilities were evaluated to determine three sites believed to represent a range of conditions to
be examined in greater detail. Hourly meteorological data for five years were ranked for these three sites to select
the location and year of the data to be used in the air modeling. For the 
average case, Huntington, West Virginia was selected. For the high-end case, Charlotte, North Carolina was selected.


An on-site boiler (as the plausible management scenario) also was evaluated for exposure through the air pathway
for still bottoms generated from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (K166), and for wastewater treatment
sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. The boiler was characterized
as a small non-hazardous boiler based upon Agency information and industry-supplied data in the RCRA Section 3007
Questionnaire data. The meteorologic data used to characterize the dispersion were determined based upon a distribution
of meteorologic data collected for sites near existing dye facilities. These data are ranked by year and location,
and the 50th- and 90th-percentile year and location were selected for the central and high-end dispersion modeling.
The air dispersion was estimated using the COMPDEP model to estimate air concentrations and wet and dry deposition
of the constituents on nearby soil, vegetables and water bodies. The air concentrations and deposition data also
were used to evaluate indirect exposures. 



Wastewaters 



For wastewater streams (K163, K165, and wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments) the
Agency determined that treatment in surface impoundments represents the plausible management scenario because,
since surface impoundments currently are in use or planned at several dye facilities, and waste management practices
in the dye and pigment industries are generally similar, the Agency believes that pigment manufacturers may employ
surface impoundments in the future. In addition, facilities currently manufacturing dyes also could manufacture
pigments in the future and manage wastewaters from pigment production in surface impoundments. 

The baseline management practice evaluated for these wastewater streams (

i.e

., K163, K165, and wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments) was treatment in tanks. Thus,
for wastewaters, the modeling included direct and indirect exposures to volatile emissions from surface impoundments
and tanks and direct and indirect exposures to contaminants that may leach into ground water from unlined surface
impoundments. The air emissions from tanks were estimated using the CHEMDAT 7 air emission model and the dispersion
of these emissions was estimated using the Industrial Source Complex Model-Long Term, Version 2 (ISCLT2) air dispersion
model. The meteorologic locations used for estimating the emissions and dispersions were the same locations selected
for use with air models for volatile emissions from landfills. Very few inhalation health-based levels are available
for constituents found in dye and pigment wastewaters. Risk from direct inhalation exposure to wastes disposed in
surface impoundments was estimated to be less than one-in-a-million for all constituents. Results from air emission
modeling for tanks are presented in the Risk Assessment Background Document for the Proposed Rule in the RCRA Docket
at EPA Headquarters (see 

ADDRESSES

 section). 

Since the constituents in these wastes are highly soluble, leaching from unlined 
impoundments was evaluated. The concentration of the constituents in the leachate was 
assumed to be equal to the concentration in the wastewater.

To estimate the concentration of constituents at the hypothetical residential well, the Agency attempted to use
the MULTIMED model to simulate the subsurface attenuation and dilution of the surface impoundment leachate. However,
there are limitations of the MULTIMED model that preclude its use in this analysis. These include the large volume
of leachate estimated to be released from the surface impoundment and a conservative approach to predict the horizontal
transport of the leachate within the aquifer. This resulted in an infiltration rate that is so high that it overwhelms
the aquifer and dilution was not expected. Therefore, to evaluate risk for those wastewaters that the Agency is proposing
to list, the Agency assumed for this proposal that a dilution and attenuation factor (DAF) of 100 is achievable during
migration to the nearest drinking water well. The Agency's toxicity characteristic (TC) rule (55 FR 11798, 1990)
adopts a DAF of 100 to estimate the subsurface fate and transport between an unlined landfill and a receptor drinking
water well. For purposes of the risk analyses, the concentrations in the residential wells near the on-site disposal
facility were estimated to be equal to 0.01 times the concentrations measured in the wastewater. The residents using
this well are assumed on average to consume 1.4 L/day or 2L/day of contaminated water for an exposure duration of 9 years
or 30 years. 


The Agency believes that it is more reasonable to use the TC rule approach to support a proposed determination to list,
rather than developing a model more sophisticated than the MULTIMED model because the Agency believes a more sophisticated
analysis would suggest greater estimated risks than the analysis using a DAF of 100 for the following reasons. First,
the DAF of 100 was derived for the TC rule for a range of municipal landfill leachate volumes that are generally lower
than leachate volumes from surface impoundments. 
Surface impoundment DAFs are expected to be lower (and risks subsequently higher) compared to landfill DAFs as a result
of both the liquid in the impoundment and subsequent increase in hydraulic head. Second, in the TC analysis, the location
of the receptor well was varied anywhere within the extent of the contaminant plume. For listing determinations,
the Agency generally assumes that the well is located on the centerline of the plume. 
This assumption would lead to a lower DAF and higher risks. Thus, because the use of the TC DAF of 100 underestimates
risk, use of the TC to estimate risk can support a proposal to list. A more sophisticated model would show only higher
risk numbers. The wastewaters that the Agency proposes not to list were evaluated using MULTIMED and creating a bounding
estimate. The Agency believes that it is reasonable to use the MULTIMED model to support this proposed determination
not to list certain wastewaters because it overestimates risks. 



Ecological Risks 



In addition to evaluating the risk to human health, the analysis also estimates risks to fish and wildlife from exposure
to dye and pigment wastes. The concentrations of contaminants of concern in water bodies near dye and pigment waste
facilities were estimated using the indirect exposure methodology and a few high-end input parameters. As a screening
analysis, the estimated surface-water concentrations were compared with the National Ambient Water Quality Criteria
(NAWQC), or LC

50

 values for bluegill and/or rainbow trout if NAWQC were not available. The risks to terrestrial and avian species were
evaluated by comparing the waste concentration with the oral rat LD

50

, dermal rabbit LD

50

, any available avian LD

50

 values, and if available, a Lowest Observed Adverse Effects Level (LOAEL). Aniline from the manufacture of triarylmethane
pigment using aniline as a reactant was the only compound identified as a potential risk to the aquatic or terrestrial
environment by this method. Details of these analyses are presented in the Risk Assessment for Dye and Pigment Waste
Listing Determination available in the public docket (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). 

The Agency requests comments on methodology used by the Agency in selecting plausible mismanagement scenarios and
assessing risks and on the plausible management scenarios selected for the wastestreams generated from the manufacture
of dyes and pigments.

E. Waste-Specific Listing Determination Rationales 


1. Wastes From the Production of Azo Pigments 


a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the 
production of azo pigments (K162). 


Summary 


EPA is proposing to list as hazardous wastewater treatment 
sludges from the production of azo pigments. This wastestream 
meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a 
waste as hazardous and is capable of posing a substantial present 
or potential hazard to human health or the environment. Based on 
ingestion of contaminated ground water, EPA calculated high-end 
individual cancer-risk levels for six hazardous constituents that 
are equal to or exceed 1E-4 for carcinogens or have HQs equal to 
or greater than 1 for non-carcinogens for the plausible 
management practice, an on-site monofill. The combined 
carcinogenic risk for multiple co-existing constituents in this 
wastestream is projected to be 6E-3 for the on-site monofill. In 
addition, a combined risk of 1E-4 for multiple co-existing 
contaminants were identified for the baseline management 
practice, a municipal landfill. Calculated risks exceeding 1E-4 
also were identified from exposure to four contaminants through 
ingestion of contaminated vegetables or through dermal contact 
with contaminated soil. Three additional contaminants pose 
calculated individual risks between 1E-4 and 1E-6 for the on-site 
monofill, and 4 contaminants pose calculated risks between these 
levels for the municipal landfill. Six contaminants pose 
calculated individual risks between 1E-4 and 1E-6 from exposures 
through indirect pathways.

Discussion



The volume reported by the industry in the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data for wastewater treatment sludge
from the manufacture of azo pigments (K162) is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality concerns.
Over 99% of this wastestream currently is disposed in Subtitle D municipal landfills. Therefore, the Agency used
disposal in a municipal landfill as the baseline management practice. In addition, as explained under Section II.D,
Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the Agency evaluated on-site monofilling as a plausible management
scenario.

The projected risks of increased cancer or hazard quotient above one for exposure to this waste are presented in Table
II-2. The data presented in this table represent 16 samples collected from 4 azo pigment-manufacturing facilities.
Eleven of the 16 samples were collected and analyzed by industry, and were submitted to EPA for evaluation. The 11 industry
samples were analyzed using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), Method 8270B in EPA's ``Test Methods
for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'' (SW-846, Third Edition) but were not analyzed using
High Pressure Liquid Chromatography/Thermospray/Mass Spectrometry (HPLC/TS/MS), Method 8321 in SW-846.
EPA has reviewed the quality of these industry submitted data and has found that these data meet the Agency's data quality
objectives and, therefore, qualify for inclusion in the waste assessment. Inclusion of these industry data, however,
does bias the industry's characterization toward one facility (

i.e.

, of 16 data points, 11 were submitted by one facility, and 2 were collected by the Agency at that same facility). The
five EPA-collected samples, representing four facilities, were analyzed using both methods, a process which encompasses
more analytes. Therefore, several analytes, specifically acetoacetanilide (AAA), acetoacet-

o

-toluidide (AAOT), and acetoacet-

o

-anisidide (AAOA), were detected in some or all of the EPA samples, but were not analyzed in the industry samples.

The calculated risks from ingesting contaminated ground water associated with disposing these sludges in on-site
monofills are very high. Three of the compounds that exceed risk levels of 1E-4 are common raw materials used
as coupling agents in the manufacture of azo pigments: acetoacetanilide (AAA), acetoacet-

o

-anisidide (AAOA), and acetoacet-

o

-toluidide (AAOT). These three compounds were expected to be present in the waste, and consistently were found in
the samples collected by the Agency.

The three coupling compounds present in this waste, AAA, AAOA, and AAOT, are predicted to pose very high risks via ground-water
ingestion when managed in an on-site monofill. As shown in Table II-2, the calculated risks posed by these compounds
range from 1E-3 to 6E-4. These risks were calculated using metabolic product structural-activity relationships
(SAR) for these compounds. A detailed discussion of the SAR for these compounds, and the estimation of toxicities
for AAA, AAOA, and AAOT is presented earlier in this preamble, under Section II.C, Description of Health and Risk Assessments,
and in the Health Assessment Background Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA Docket for this
rulemaking (See 

addresses

 section).

These three compounds are high-volume couplers used in the manufacture of azo pigments. Based on RCRA Section 3007
Questionnaire data, AAA is the third highest-volume reactant in the pigment industry, with over 8200 metric tons
used in 1991. AAOT and AAOA also are used in high volumes; their 1991 use volumes were 2600 and 850 Mtons, respectively.

AAA, AAOT, and AAOA were found in 85% of the wastewater systems where they are used. When detected in the wastewater
system, the compound was found either in the wastewater or in the sludge. Table II-4 presents the number of wastewater
systems where each of the three coupling compounds were detected. Table II-4 also shows the number of samples
in which the three coupling compounds were detected relative to the number in which the compounds were expected.

Amides (

e.g

., AAA, AAOT, and AAOA) hydrolyze to form free 
acids and amine salts under acidic conditions. Measurements of 
pH values of process wastewaters at several pigment production 
facilities revealed that these acidic conditions are encountered 
frequently. The hydrolysis products for AAA, AAOT, and AAOA are 
aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline, respectively. The 
unreacted amide raw materials and the amines expected from 
hydrolysis of these amides both have been identified in untreated 
wastewaters and wastewater biological treatment sludges. 
Two sets of coeluting compounds were observed from the 
analysis of wastewater treatment sludge from the production of 
azo pigments. The first set of coeluting compounds produced one 
data point, shown in Table E1, for which the mass spectrum 
indicates the presence of 2-methoxyaniline, along with the 
potential presence of 2- and 4-aminoaniline (for a discussion of 
coeluting compounds and risk assessments conducted on these 
compounds, please refer to the section entitled ``Coeluting 
Compounds'' in Section II.D). 2-Methoxyaniline is expected as a 
contaminant in the wastewater treatment sludge from the facility 
that generated the sample because that facility manufactures azo 
pigments using acetoacet-

o

-anisidide (AAOA) as a raw material, 
and, as stated above, 2-methoxyaniline is an expected hydrolysis 
product of AAOA. In addition, the facility from which this 
sample was collected uses 2-aminoaniline as a reactant in the 
manufacture of azo dyes. 
For this wastestream, the Agency conducted the risk 
assessment for these coeluting compounds based on toxicity 
information for 2-methoxyaniline because this contaminant is 
expected to be present from azo pigment production. Since there 
currently is no HBL for 2-methoxyaniline, the Agency based the 
risk assessment on the toxicity of a surrogate compound. 2-Aminotoluene is a structural analog of 2-methoxyaniline
and is 
being used as a toxicity surrogate. The resulting high-end 
individual cancer-risk level for 2-methoxyaniline was calculated 
to be 2E-3 for the on-site monofill management scenario. 
The second set of coeluting compounds consists of the two 
isomers 2- and 4-aminotoluene. The two isomers were detected in 
3 out of 8 sludge samples from azo pigment manufacturing 
operations, and the combined concentration of the two compounds 
was quantified. The calculated high-end individual cancer-risk 
level, based on the toxicity of 2-aminotoluene, is 3E-5 for the 
on-site monofill management scenario. 
In addition to the substantial calculated risks (

i.e.,

 
exceeding 1E-4 for carcinogens) posed by raw materials used in 
azo pigment manufacturing and their break-down products, four 
additional contaminants were found in the wastestream at 
concentrations that are projected to pose very high risks (HQs of 
1 or greater for non-carcinogens) through ingestion of 
contaminated ground water under plausible management in an on-site monofill. 1,3-Dinitrobenzene, nitrobenzene,
and 2,4-dinitrophenol were found at concentrations that resulted in 
calculated high-end HQs of 7, 9, and 1 respectively. 
In addition to assessing the risks associated with the 
individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers 
the combined risk of constituents that co-exist in the 
wastestream. In the case of wastewater treatment sludges 
generated from the manufacture of azo pigments, all of the 
diazotization and coupling reactants and breakdown products 
previously discussed in this section (

i.e

., AAA, AAOT, AAOA, 
aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline) are assumed to co-exist in the wastestream. The reactants are used
in numerous 
large-volume pigments which are manufactured on a frequent basis. 
Since this sludge is a commingled wastestream representing 
production from the entire plant, the constituents are likely to 
be present simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined 
risk of these individual constituents, which is projected to be 
very high (

i.e.,

 8E-3 at the high end), also was considered in 
making this listing determination. 
In addition to the very high risks posed by the plausible 
management practice (a monofill), the calculated risks posed by 
the current management practice (a municipal landfill) are also 
high. The combined additive high-end risk for the reactants and 
breakdown products previously discussed in this section (

i.e.,

 
AAA, AAOT, AAOA, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline) 
is projected to be 1E-4 for the municipal landfill management 
practice. Therefore, EPA concludes that even if the Agency 
considered current management and did not consider plausible 
management, this wastestream would present a substantial risk to 
human health and the environment, and should be listed as 
hazardous. 
Three additional constituents (

i.e

., aniline, 3,3
'-dimethylbenzidine, and 
2-aminotoluene) were found in the 
wastewater treatment sludge from azo pigment operations at 
concentrations that are projected to pose risks within the 
Agency's risk range of concern (

i.e

., 1E-4 to 1E-6 for 
carcinogens) using the on-site monofill management scenario. 
Four constituents (

i.e

., AAOA, AAOT, AAA, and the coeluting 
compounds 2-aminoaniline and 2-methoxyaniline) were found in this 
waste at concentrations that pose risks between 1E-4 and 1E-6 for 
carcinogens for the municipal landfill scenario. In addition, 
six constituents pose risks within this range of potential 
concern through indirect pathways. 
Based on an analysis of the risks associated with both 
current and plausible management practices, EPA is proposing to 
list wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo 
pigments as a hazardous waste, designated as EPA Hazardous Waste 
Number K162. 
For the reasons stated above, the Agency is proposing to add 
the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis 
for Listing: Aniline, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 2-aminotoluene, 4-aminotoluene,
acetoacet-

o

-anisidide, acetoacet-

o

-toluidide, acetoacetanilide, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, 3,3
'-dimethylbenzidine, nitrobenzene, and 2,4-dinitrophenol. 
In addition, acetoacet-

o

-anisidide, acetoacet-

o

-toluidide, 
acetoacetanilide, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2- 
methoxyaniline, and 1,3-dinitrobenzene are proposed to be added 
to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous Constituents.

b. Wastewaters from the production of azo pigments (K163). 


Summary 


The Agency is proposing to list wastewaters from the 
production of azo pigments as hazardous wastes. This waste meets 
the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste 
as hazardous and is capable of posing a significant present or 
potential hazard to human health or the environment. Based on 
ingestion of contaminated ground water, EPA calculated high-end 
individual risk levels for three carcinogens that exceed 1E-4 for 
disposal in an unlined on-site surface impoundment, the plausible 
management scenario. The calculated combined carcinogenic risk 
for these constituents is 3E-4 from exposure to contaminated 
ground water for the surface impoundment management scenario. To 
further support this listing, four additional contaminants pose 
individual risks between 1E-4 and 1E-6 for the surface 
impoundment scenario. 


Discussion 


Data from the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire show that the 
1991 volume reported by the industry for the wastewater stream 
from azo pigment production is 9,914,662 metric tons, or 
approximately 7.2 million gallons per day. Over 75% of 
wastewaters from azo pigment manufacturing currently are 
pretreated and discharged to a publicly owned treatment works 
(POTW). Most of these wastewaters are treated in equalization 
and neutralization tanks prior to discharge to a POTW. A smaller 
percentage of these wastewaters is subjected to aerobic 
biological treatment in tanks, with subsequent NPDES discharge to 
a surface water. 
As explained under Section II.D, Description of Health and 
Risk Assessments, the risk assessment for these wastewaters was 
performed using treatment in tanks as the current, or baseline, 
management practice, and treatment in surface impoundments as a 
plausible management scenario. The risks of increased cancer for 
exposure to this waste are presented in Table II-5. The data 
presented in this table represent six samples collected from four 
azo pigment manufacturing facilities.

The calculated risks associated with managing these wastewaters in surface impoundments are very high. Three constituents
are considered to pose a substantial potential hazard to human health and the environment (

i.e.

, risks exceed 1E-4). Calculated risks for each of these three compounds are 1E-4. 

Three of the constituents that have been projected to pose a risk greater than 1E-6, namely, acetoacetanilide
(AAA), acetoacet-

o

-toluidide (AAOT), and acetoacet-

o

-anisidide (AAOA), are high-volume coupling reactants used in the manufacture of azo pigments. As explained above
for K162, these constituents are dominant raw materials in the azo pigment manufacturing industry and generally
are present in the wastewater treatment systems at 
these sites. As shown in Table II-5, the risks calculated by these compounds range from 1E-4 to 1E-6.
As stated for K162, these risks were calculated using metabolic product structural-activity relationships (SAR)
for these compounds, an approach which is discussed in detail in Section II.D of this preamble, 
and in the Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking
(See 

ADDRESSES

 section). 

Table II-4, presented earlier, shows that AAA and AAOA were detected in all of the wastewater samples collected
from facilities that use these reactants. AAOT was found only in one of four wastewater samples, but it was found in
all four of the sludge samples collected from facilities using the compound. The Agency believes that the latter compound
generally is present in 
the wastewater treatment system at facilities that use AAOT as a raw material but that it may be preferentially partitioning
to the sludge. 

In addition to the high risks calculated by the three reactants, AAA, AAOA, and AAOT, the hydrolysis products of these
compounds, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline, also were detected in the waste at concentrations that
pose significant risk (

i.e.

, risks ranging from 1E-4 to 4E-6). Discussions addressing hydrolysis pathways and conditions for 
these compounds, and the issue of coeluting compounds associated with the hydrolysis products, were presented earlier
in this preamble (see discussion of K162, and Section II.D). 

In addition to the primary raw materials and breakdown products presented above, the combined 2,4- and 2,6-isomers
of dimethylaniline, which also are suspected raw material breakdown products, were detected in this waste at concentrations
that pose a very high risk (

i.e.

, a risk of 1E-4). 

Along with risks associated with the individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers the combined
risks of constituents that co-exist in the wastestream. In the case of wastewaters generated from the manufacture
of azo pigments, all of the reactants and breakdown products previously discussed in this section (

i.e.

, AAA, AAOT, AAOA, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline) are assumed to co-exist in the wastestream. The
reactants are used in producing numerous large-volume pigments that are manufactured on a frequent basis. Since
this wastewater stream represents several commingled wastestreams from throughout the plant, the constituents
are likely to be present simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined risks of these individual constituents,
which are projected to be very high under the surface impoundment mismanagment scenario (i.e., 3E-4 at the high
end), also were considered in making this listing determination. 

Based on the calculated risks associated with the plausible management practice for this waste (treatment in surface
impoundments), EPA is proposing to list wastewaters from the production of azo pigments as a hazardous waste, designated
EPA Hazardous Waste Number K163. However, the Agency recognizes that if wastewater treatment sludges from the production
of azo pigments (K162) are listed as proposed, the available options for wastewater management may change and the
surface impoundment scenario may not be plausible for the following reason: wastewaters that are managed in an impoundment
will generate 
sludges through precipitation. In the event that K162 sludges were listed and the wastewaters were not, the sludges
generated in a Subtitle D wastewater impoundment would be hazardous wastes and the surface impoundment would become
subject to RCRA Subtitle C regulation. The Agency is requesting comment on whether the use of Subtitle D surface impoundments
to manage wastewaters 
would be a plausible management scenario if the wastewaters were not listed but the wastewater treatment sludges
were listed as hazardous wastes. The Agency also is requesting comment on the need to list K163 wastewaters, given
that the plausibility of the management scenario on which the risk assessment was based may be affected by the final
outcome of the K162 sludge listing. 

For the reasons stated above, EPA proposes to add the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis for
Listing: Aniline, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 2-aminotoluene, 3-aminotoluene, 4-aminotoluene,
acetoacet-

o

-anisidide, acetoacet-

o

-toluidide, acetoacetanilide, 2,4-dimethylaniline, and 2,6-dimethylaniline. 

In addition, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 3-aminotoluene, acetoacet-

o

-anisidide, acetoacet-

o

-toluidide, acetoacetanilide, 2,4-dimethylaniline, and 2,6-dimethylaniline are proposed to be added to Appendix
VIII to Part 261_Hazardous Constituents.

2. Wastes from the production of azo dyes. 
a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the 
production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C 
colorants (K164). 


Summary 


EPA is proposing to list wastewater treatment sludge from 
the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants, as a 
hazardous waste. This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 
40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is 
capable of posing a substantial present or potential risk to 
human health or the environment. Based on ingestion of 
contaminated ground water, EPA calculated high-end individual 
cancer risk levels for five constituents which exceed 1E-4 for 
carcinogens and have HQs of 1 or greater for non-carcinogens for 
the plausible management practice, an on-site monofill. Four 
additional contaminants further support the listing by posing 
individual risks between 1E-4 and 1E-6. Risks between 1E-4 and 
1E-6 also were identified for six contaminants from exposure to 
these constituents through other exposure pathways. 



Discussion 



The majority of wastewater treatment sludge from the 
production of azo dyes is biological treatment sludge. The 
information on volume and the percentage of this waste volume 
disposed of at Subtitle D municipal landfills, as reported in the 
1992 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, is not included at the 
present time due to business confidentiality concerns.

As discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of 
Health and Risk Assessments, the Agency conducted the risk 
assessment on these wastestreams using both a current, or 
baseline management scenario, and a plausible management 
scenario. Information relating to this discussion is not 
included at the present time due to business confidentiality 
concerns. 



Therefore, the Agency conducted the risk assessment on two 
current management scenarios, a municipal landfill, and a 
monofill, with the monofill representing the plausible management 
practice. 



The risk projections associated with this wastestream are 
presented in Table II-6. The data presented in this table 
represent 18 samples collected from four azo dye manufacturing 
facilities. Eleven of the 18 samples were collected and analyzed 
by industry, and were submitted to EPA for evaluation. 



The risks associated with disposing these sludges in 
monofills are projected to be very high. Five constituents found 
in the waste are predicted to pose individual high-end cancer-
risk levels equal to or exceeding 1E-4 or HQs equal to or 
exceeding 1 for non-carcinogens, through ingestion of 
contaminated ground water or vegetables. The five constituents 
pose carcinogenic risks ranging from 1E-4 to 5E-4 and non- 
carcinogenic hazards from 2 to 45 times above the RfDs for the 
monofill management scenario. 



There are two cases of coeluting constituents for this 
wastestream. As shown in Table II-6, there is one data point for 
which the mass spectrum indicates the presence of 2- 
methoxyaniline, along with the potential presence of 2- and 4- 
aminoaniline. As discussed in Section II.D, EPA based the risk 
assessment for this set of coeluting compounds on 2-aminoaniline. 
The calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level for 2- 
aminoaniline is 5E-4 for the monofill management scenario. 



The second set of coeluting compounds consists of the three 
isomers 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene. The presence of the three 
isomers was confirmed in four out of six wastewater samples 
collected from azo dye manufacturing operations, and the combined 
concentration of the three compounds was quantified. The 
calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level, based on the 
toxicity of 2-aminotoluene, is 1E-4 for the monofill management 
scenario (See Section II.D of this preamble, Coeluting Compounds, 
for more details on the Agency's approach to risk assessment for 
coeluting compounds). 



In addition to the two sets of coeluting compounds used as 
raw materials in azo dye manufacturing, three compounds, 1,3- 
dinitrobenzene, 4-methylphenol, and 2,4-dinitrophenol were found 
at concentrations that are projected to pose a substantial risk 
to human health and the environment. The risks presented by 
these compounds are calculated to have high-end HQs of 45, 3, and 
2, respectively.

Aniline is a high-volume dye reactant present in the wastewater treatment sludge at multiple facilities, according
to RCRA Section 3007 questionnaire data. Aniline is the fourth highest-volume reactant used in the dye industry,
according to data provided in the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaires, with a 1991 use volume of 4860 metric tons.
Based on the aniline concentrations found in the waste, the Agency has calculated a high-end individual cancer-risk
level for this constituent at 1E-5.

Aniline was found in over 70% of the samples of wastewater treatment sludge from azo dye production. However, 11 of
the 13 aniline data points, which were all from one facility, were dropped prior to the risk assessment because the
facility reported that aniline found in the wastewater treatment sludges is associated with non-dye operations.
This facility consumes larger volumes of aniline in their non-dye operations than in the manufacture of azo dyes.
It is likely that aniline from dye operations contributed to the presence of the constituent in the waste; however,
the Agency could not determine the extent of this contribution.

In studying the wastewater treatment systems from azo dye manufacturing operations as a whole, the Agency found aniline
to be present in all systems from which samples were collected. In addition, aniline was consistently present in the
wastewaters for all samples collected. Furthermore, even though aniline would be expected to biodegrade in the wastewater
treatment system, aniline was present in 2 out of 5 samples from the wastewater treatment sludge. Because the wastewater
treatment sludge presents a complex matrix for chemical analysis, the detection limits obtained for the wastewater
treatment sludges were high. Therefore, the Agency believes that, given the consistent presence of aniline in the
wastewater, and the detection of aniline in 2 out of 5 sludge samples (with 11 data points dropped for the reasons stated
earlier), aniline typically is present in wastewater treatment sludges from azo dye manufacturing operations.
Based on the aniline concentrations found in the two data points that remain after 11 data points were dropped, the
Agency has determined that the risk posed by aniline in this wastestream is significant.

An additional high-volume raw material used in the manufacture of azo dyes, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine, was found
to be present in the wastewater treatment sludge from azo dye operations at concentrations that result in calculated
high-end individual cancer-risk level of 2E-5. Based on data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire,
1719 metric tons of 3,3'-dimethyoxybenzidine were used in the manufacture of azo dyes in 1991.

In addition to the risks posed by the individual hazardous constituents found in the waste, some of the contaminants
are co-occurring in this wastestream. The Agency found that sludge samples collected from each of the four azo dye
manufacturing facilities generally contain one or more toxic raw materials simultaneously. Therefore, some individual
carcinogens are co-occurring in the waste and the calculated risks are assumed to be additive. Given the waste characterization
and risk assessment results, along with toxicity information on other raw materials used in the production of azo
dyes (

i.e.

, aromatic amines), the Agency believes that wastewater treatment sludges from azo dye manufacturing typically
contain one or more toxic raw materials at concentrations that pose a significant risk.

In addition to the azo dye raw materials that were found in the wastestream at concentrations that pose a high risk,
two additional constituents, 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline, and the two coeluting compounds diphenylamine and N-nitrosodiphenylamine,
were found in the wastewater treatment sludge from azo dye operations at concentrations that pose carcinogenic risks
above 1E-6 (See Section II.D for treatment of coeluting compounds).

The results from the assessment of exposure pathways other than drinking contaminated ground water resulting from
management in an on-site monofill also are presented in Table II-6. Calculated high-end individual cancer-risk
levels between 1E-4 and 1E-6 were identified for six contaminants through indirect exposure pathways
(contaminated vegetable ingestion) if airborne dusts are not controlled.

In addition to the risks posed by the monofill management practice, the calculated risk posed by municipal landfill
disposal also is within EPA's range of potential concern, 1E-6 to 1E-4, for two sets of coeluting compounds,
2- and 4-aminoaniline/2-methoxyaniline, and 2- and 4-aminotoluene. The Agency also considered the risks posed
by these contaminants for a municipal landfill when making the listing decision.

Based on an analysis of the risks associated with the current management practices, a monofill and municipal landfill,
EPA is proposing to list as hazardous wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C
colorants, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K164.

For the reasons stated above, the Agency is proposing to add the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis
for Listing: 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, aniline, diphenylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine,
3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine, 4-methylphenol, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitrophenol,
2-aminotoluene, and 4-aminotoluene.

In addition, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, 4-methylphenol,
1,3-dinitrobenzene, and 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous
Constituents.

b. Wastewaters from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants (K165).



Summary



The Agency is proposing to list wastewaters from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants, as hazardous.
This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is capable of
posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. Based on ingestion of contaminated
ground water, EPA calculated a high-end individual risk level of 1E-4 for one hazardous constituent for the
plausible management scenario, treatment in an unlined surface impoundment. Two additional constituents are estimated
to pose risks between 1E-4 and 1E-6 for the surface impoundment scenario.



Discussion



Based on response data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, the volume reported by the industry for wastewaters
from azo dye production, excluding FD&C colorants, was 6,295,779 metric tons per year, or 4.6 million gallons
per day. Approximately 58% of wastewaters from azo dye production, excluding FD&C colorants currently are pretreated
and discharged to a POTW. Over 40% of these wastewaters are treated in aerobic biological tank systems, with subsequent
NPDES discharge to a surface water. Approximately 5% of the wastewaters from azo dye operations excluding FD&C
colorants are treated in biological treatment systems that use surface impoundments.

As discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of 
Health and Risk Assessments, the risk assessment for these 
wastewaters was performed using treatment in tanks as the 
current, or baseline, management practice, and treatment in 
surface impoundments as a plausible management scenario. For 
this waste, however, the worst-case management scenario, 
treatment in a surface impoundment, is also one of the current 
management practices. The calculated risks of increased cancer 
or hazard quotient above one for exposure to this waste are 
presented in Table II-7. The data presented in this table 
represent seven samples collected from five azo dye-manufacturing 
facilities.

The risk associated with the wastewaters in tanks is 
estimated to be below levels of concern. However, the risks 
associated with managing these wastewaters in surface 
impoundments are calculated to be high. One constituent found in 
the waste is considered capable of posing a substantial present 
or potential risk to human health or the environment (

i.e.

, risks 
are 1E-4 or higher for carcinogens, or 1 or higher HQs for non-carcinogens). The constituent poses a risk 1E-4.

As was the case with wastewater treatment sludge from the 
production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants, the wastewaters 
were found to contain high concentrations of aniline, a high-volume dye reactant that poses an unacceptable risk
at such 
levels. In fact, aniline was present in each of the seven 
wastewater samples from azo dye production. However, two of the 
seven aniline data points, which were both from one facility, 
were dropped prior to the risk assessment because the facility 
reported that aniline found in the wastewater is associated with 
non-dye operations. This facility consumes larger volumes of 
aniline in their non-dye operations than in the manufacture of 
azo dyes. It is likely that aniline from dye operations 
contributed to the presence of the constituent in the waste; 
however, the Agency could not determine the extent of this 
contribution. 

Based on the aniline concentrations represented by the five 
remaining data points, the Agency has determined that the risks 
posed by aniline in this wastestream are 2E-6). 

The presence of three coeluting isomers, 2-, 3-, and 4-
aminotoluene, was confirmed in four out of six wastewater samples 
collected from azo dye manufacturing operations, and the combined 
concentration of the three compounds was quantified (refer to 
earlier discussion under Section II.D.2, Coeluting Compounds, for 
a discussion on the coelution of 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene). 
The calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level, based on 
the toxicity of 2-aminotoluene, is 1E-4 for the surface 
impoundment management scenario.

The second set of coeluting compounds consists of 2- and 4- 
aminoaniline, and 2-methoxyaniline. EPA based the risk 
assessment for this set of coeluting compounds on 2-aminoaniline, 
as discussed in Section II.D.2. The resulting calculated high- 
end individual cancer-risk level is 1E-5 for the surface 
impoundment management scenario. 

Based on the risks associated with the plausible management 
practice for this waste, EPA is proposing to list wastewaters 
from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants, as a 
hazardous waste, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K165. 
However, the Agency recognizes that if wastewater treatment 
sludges from the production of azo dyes (K164) are listed as 
proposed, the available options for wastewater management may 
change and surface impoundments may not be used. Wastewaters 
that are managed in an impoundment will generate sludges through 
precipitation. In the event that K164 sludges were listed and 
the wastewaters were not, the sludges generated in a Subtitle D 
wastewater impoundment would be hazardous wastes and the surface 
impoundment would become subject to RCRA Subtitle C regulation. 
The Agency is requesting comment on whether it would be plausible 
to use a Subtitle D surface impoundment to manage wastewaters if 
the wastewaters were not listed and the wastewater treatment 
sludges were listed as hazardous wastes. The Agency also is 
requesting comment on the need to list K165 wastewaters, given 
that the plausibility of the worst-case management scenario on 
which the risk assessment was based may be affected by the K164 
sludge listing. 

For the reasons stated above, EPA proposes to add the 
following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis for 
Listing: 2-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 2-aminotoluene, 3- 
aminotoluene, 4-aminotoluene, and aniline. 

In addition, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline and 3-aminotoluene are proposed to be added to
Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous Constituents. 

3. Wastes from the production of triarylmethane dyes 
and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments 
using aniline as a feedstock). 

a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the 
production of triarylmethane dyes and 
pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments 
using aniline as a feedstock). 



Summary



EPA is proposing to defer the decision on whether to list 
wastewater treatment sludges from the production of 
triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane 
pigments using aniline as a feedstock) due to insufficient waste 
characterization data. The Agency is planning to collect 
additional information on this wastestream. EPA then will 
publish a supplemental notice with a proposed determination on 
whether to list this waste.

Discussion 



This waste is generated from the treatment of wastewaters from triarylmethane dye and pigment manufacturing. These
wastewaters often are commingled with wastewaters from the manufacture of other dyes and pigments. As a result, the
wastewater treatment sludges typically are managed also as a commingled wastestream from the production of triarylmethane
and any other dyes or pigments manufactured at the site. Based on the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, the 1991
volume reported by the industry for this wastestream is 1,404 metric tons. 

Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments is generated at only five facilities.
The Agency's sampling program, which was conducted in support of this listing determination, included wastewater
treatment sludge from one of the five facilities generating this waste. However, the facility was not manufacturing
triarylmethane dyes or pigments during the time of the sampling activities. Therefore, the resulting absence of
constituents attributable to the triarylmethane operations was not unexpected. 

In conclusion, based on insufficient characterization data, the Agency proposes to defer a listing decision on wastewater
treatment sludges from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments
using aniline as a feedstock). The Agency is proposing to conduct additional sampling on this wastestream and will
publish a supplemental notice with a proposed listing determination.

aniline as a feedstock). 



Summary 



EPA is proposing not to list wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane
pigments using aniline as a feedstock) because the constituents in this waste were observed at concentrations that
present low risk levels (

i.e.

, calculated at less than 1E-6 for carcinogens and lower than 1 HQ for non-carcinogens) through ingestion of
contaminated ground water, and no other hazardous constituents attributed to triarylmethane dye or pigment production
were detected. 



Discussion 



Volume information reported by the industry in the 1992 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire for the wastewater stream
from triarylmethane dye and pigment production is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality
concerns. Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments
using aniline as a feedstock) often are commingled with wastewaters from the manufacture of azos and other dyes and
pigments.

Information on the percentage of these wastewaters currently 
pretreated and discharged to a POTW, and on the percentage 
treated in a biological treatment system and discharged to a 
surface water under the NPDES system is not included at the 
present time due to business confidentiality concerns. As 
discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of Health and 
Risk Assessments, the risk assessment for these wastewaters was 
performed using treatment in tanks and surface impoundments as 
the baseline and plausible management practices, respectively. 

The Agency believes that the three wastewater samples 
collected from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and 
pigments are representative of the industry, in part, because 
wastewater samples were collected from the two largest 
triarylmethane dye producers in the country. Furthermore, the 
chemical analyses conducted on this waste encompassed the most 
important raw materials used in the manufacture of triarylmethane 
dyes and pigments, and these compounds were not detected at 
concentrations that pose a significant risk. For example, N,N-dimethylaniline is a large volume raw material used
in the 
manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and pigment, and was analyzed 
using the Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrophotometry analytical 
method. In addition to the GC/MS analysis, specific analyses 
were conducted in order to look for two additional toxic raw 
materials for triarylmethane dyes and pigments; chloranil and 
another raw material that cannot be identified due to business 
confidentiality concerns. As shown in Table II-8, N,N- 
dimethylaniline and the other raw material that cannot be 
identified were not found in these wastewaters at concentrations 
that pose a significant risk, and chloranil was not detected at 
all in the wastewaters. 

Table II-8 presents eight constituents, obtained from three 
wastewater samples which were collected at three out of 14 
facilities that manufacture triarylmethane dyes or pigments. 
These eight compounds are the constituents that were found to be 
attributable to the triarylmethane processes, and six of the 
eight compounds were dropped following the risk assessment 
screening (see the Listing and Risk Assessment for Dye and 
Pigment Waste Listing Determination Background Documents for this 
proposed rule, located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking 
(see 

ADDRESSES 

section) for the process used in identifying 
attributable constituents and for the process used for dropping 
compounds after risk screening, respectively). Because these 
compounds are not expected to bioaccumulate, the maximum measured 
concentrations of those constituents with HBLs in this 
wastestream were compared to their HBLs, and the ratio of 
concentrations to HBL values was less than 1, indicating that the 
concentrations of these compounds in the waste are not expected 
to pose a risk to human health or the environment. The two 
remaining constituents, 4-nitroaniline and a constituent that 
cannot be identified at the present time due to confidentiality 
concerns, were detected at low concentrations and do not have 
HBLs needed to conduct a risk assessment. The risks posed by 
these two constituents, however, were assessed using surrogate 
compounds. Neither of the compounds are expected to be potential 
carcinogens. Furthermore, the Agency selected surrogate 
compounds that are structurally similar to the compounds detected 
in the waste, and are estimated, by means of structural activity 
relationships (SARs), to be more toxic than the subject 
compounds. Nitrobenzene was selected as a surrogate for 4-nitroaniline. Surrogate information on the second constituent

cannot be included at the present time due to business 
confidentiality concerns. The ratios of concentration to HBL 
(HQ) determined by this analysis were also less than 1, 
indicating that, if the contaminant concentrations found in the 
waste were actually present in drinking water, the risks posed by 
ingesting the drinking water would be insignificant. More 
detailed discussions on the risk assessment screening and 
surrogate compounds are presented in the Dye and Pigment Listing 
Support Health Effects Background Document, which is located in 
the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). 

In conclusion, because the constituents in this waste were 
observed at concentrations that present low risk levels, and no 
other hazardous constituents attributed to triarylmethane dye or 
pigment production were detected, the Agency is proposing not to 
list wastewaters from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and 
pigments as hazardous.

4.Wastes from the production of triarylmethane 
pigments using aniline as a feedstock. 

Triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock 
currently are produced at two domestic facilities. These 
facilities each produce a single product which is manufactured 
throughout the year using aniline as the major feedstock. The 
two processes are markedly different from other dye and pigment 
processes in the industry. Most dye and pigment processes 
manufacture numerous products on a batch basis, using different 
raw materials for each product. The wastes generated from 
typical dye manufacturing plants vary in composition over time 
due to the constant changes in raw materials. In contrast, 
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock are 
generated at facilities that are dedicated to the manufacture of 
one product continuously throughout the year, and use only two 
raw materials, aniline and formaldehyde, at the site. In 
addition, aniline is used in excess in the process. These 
differences have a significant impact on the compositions of the 
waste. Such wastes were expected, and found, to contain high 
concentrations of aniline. The listing Background Document, 
found in the RCRA docket (see 

ADDRESSES 

section) for this 
proposed rulemaking, contains details on the process for 
manufacturing triarylmethane (TAM) pigments using aniline as a 
feedstock.

a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. 



Summary



The Agency is proposing not to list as hazardous wastewater 
treatment sludges from the production of triarylmethane pigments 
using aniline as a feedstock. If this wastestream were managed 
by disposal in a municipal landfill (the plausible management 
scenario used for other wastewater treatment sludges), it would 
meet the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a 
waste as hazardous and would be capable of posing a substantial 
present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. 
However, as discussed in Section II.D, Description of Health and 
Risk Assessments, the Agency has determined that management in a 
municipal landfill is not plausible for this wastestream. 
Despite this determination, for comparison purposes the Agency 
calculated the risks associated with disposal in a municipal 
landfill and with diposal in an on-site boiler. If, based on 
comments, the Agency determines that it is not reasonable to use 
fuel blending as the plausible management scenario, the Agency 
probably would determine that plausible management is disposal in 
a municipal landfill for the ground-water pathway, and is 
disposal in an on-site boiler for the air pathway. Disposal in 
an on-site monofill, which was established as the plausible 
management scenario for other wastewater treatment sludges (

i.e.

, 
K162 and K164), is not a practical option for this wastestream 
due to its low volume relative to the capacity of a monofill, and 
so is not feasible economically. 

Based on ingestion of contaminated ground water due to 
releases from a municipal landfill, EPA calculated high-end 
individual cancer-risk levels of 1E-4 and 8E-5 for the 
constituents benzidine and aniline, respectively. The coeluting 
compounds 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene are calculated to 
pose risks between 1E-6 and 1E-5. Therefore, the combined 
carcinogenic risk for multiple co-existing constituents in this 
wastestream would be 2E-4, assuming disposal in a landfill. 
However, the risks associated with the current and plausible 
management practice, blending with non-hazardous fuel, are 
insignificant for any constituent. Thus, the Agency is proposing 
not to list it as hazardous. 



Discussion
 


Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of 
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock currently is 
generated at only one facility. This waste is generated from a 
filter press that is used as part of the wastewater pretreatment 
system. The waste is generated at a rate of approximately 18 
metric tons per year. 

EPA has summarized the risk projections associated with this 
sludge in Table II-9. The data presented in this table represent 
one sample from one facility. Unlike earlier wastestreams, 
health benchmarks exist for all the contaminants detected in this 
wastestream (with the exception of one coeluting compound, which 
is discussed later in this section). Additional compounds which 
do have health benchmarks, however, have been identified in these 
wastes, but were dropped from further consideration following the 
risk screening. The complete list of compounds found in this and 
other wastestreams is presented in the Listing Background 
Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA 
Docket for this rulemaking (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). 

Details on the risk assessment are provided in Section II.D 
of this preamble, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, and 
in the Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, 
located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (see 

ADDRESSES

 
section).

As shown in Table II-9, benzidine is present in this 
wastestream at concentrations that pose a substantial risk to 
human health and the environment (

i.e.

, equal to or greater than 
1E-5 for carcinogens) for the municipal landfill management 
scenario. Benzidine was found to be present in several 
wastestreams from the manufacture of triarylmethane pigments 
using aniline as a feedstock, including wastewaters from both 
facilities that manufacture these pigments. The Agency believes 
that benzidine is either a raw material contaminant or a reaction 
by-product from the process. 

Large quantities of aniline, typically in excess, are used 
as a raw material to this process. As a result, this wastestream 
was found to contain over three percent aniline. The calculated 
high-end individual cancer-risk level for aniline is 8E-5 for the 
landfill scenario. 

In addition to benzidine and aniline, the waste was found to 
contain two other hazardous constituents that are believed to be 
by-products of the reaction and pose a significant risk at the 
concentrations detected for the municipal landfill management 
scenario. Two additional compounds presented in Table II-9, 1,2- 
diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene, coelute on the mass spectrum 
(see Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, 
for a discussion on the Agency's approach to risk assessment for 
coeluting compounds). Both compounds are likely oxidation 
products of aniline, and may be present in the waste as reaction 
by-products. In addition to the uncertainty in establishing 
concentrations for each of the two compounds, the chemical 
pathway from aniline to these oxidation products suggests that 
either contaminant may be present at all or part of the 
concentration detected. The Agency conducted the risk assessment 
using the health-based levels for 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and 
azobenzene, independently. For disposal in a municipal landfill, 
the calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level for these 
coeluting compounds, based on the toxicity of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, is 2E-5. 

In addition to assessing the risks associated with the 
individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers 
the combined risk of constituents that co-exist in the 
wastestream. In the case of this wastewater treatment sludge, 
all of the constituents discussed above (

i.e.

, aniline, 
benzidine, and 1,2-diphenylhydrazine/azobenzene) are believed to 
co-exist in the wastestream. The processes that produce 
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock are 
operated continuously all year. As a result, the constituents 
detected in the wastestream are likely to be present 
simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined calculated 
risk of these individual constituents, for the municipal landfill 
scenario would be 2E-4 at the high end. 

However, the risks associated with the current and plausible 
management practice for this wastestream (blending with non-hazardous fuel for combustion) are insignificant.
As discussed 
in Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the 
Agency believes that the fuel blending will continue. The 
relatively high organic content of the waste gives the material 
value as a fuel ingredient and, therefore, generators of this 
waste have an economic incentive to continue fuel blending. 
Therefore, the Agency is proposing not to list the wastestream as 
hazardous. If the NPDES program requirements were to change 
(

i.e.

, become more stringent) then those triarylmethane pigment 
producers that currently do not generate a sludge could be forced 
to generate a sludge due to their efforts to meet new NPDES 
requirements. In that case, the plausible management scenario 
would change, and other practices, such as landfilling, would 
become possible. The Agency may reopen this listing decision 
should this occur, and will use the risk levels associated with 
this management scenario to make a revised listing determination. 

b. Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. 



Summary 



The Agency is proposing not to list as hazardous 
wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments using 
aniline as a feedstock. As shown in Table II-10, these 
wastewaters contain an average aniline concentration of 200 ppm. 
In addition, the wastewaters contain the same hazardous by-products found in the wastewater treatment sludge. Although
this 
wastestream, if managed in surface impoundments, would meet the 
criteria set out in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as 
hazardous and would be capable of posing a substantial present or 
potential risk to human health or the environment if released 
into the environment, the Agency has determined that management 
in surface impoundments is not plausible for this wastestream. 
The Agency believes this because 100% of this wastestream is 
managed in exempt tanks. The Agency has no reason to believe 
that this management practice will change. Risk associated with 
treatment in tanks is insignificant and, thus, the Agency is 
proposing not to list this waste as hazardous. However, for 
comparison purposes, the Agency has calculated the risks 
associated with disposal of this wastestream in a surface 
impoundment. If, based on comments, the Agency determines that 
it is not reasonable to assume that management in tanks is the 
correct plausible management scenario, the Agency probably would 
determine that management in a surface impoundment is the 
appropriate plausible management scenario. 



Discussion



These wastewaters are generated from filtrations of process 
intermediates and products, flushing operations, equipment 
washdowns, floor washings, and process operations. Based on 
response data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, a 
total of 757,080 metric tons, or 0.4 million gallons per day, of 
wastewater from the production of triarylmethane (TAM) pigments 
is generated. Information on generation relevant to this 
discussion is not included at the present time due to business 
confidentiality concerns. All of the wastewaters generated from 
TAM pigment production (using aniline as a feedstock) are treated 
in tanks prior to discharge to a POTW. The data presented in Table II-10 represent three samples collected from
two TAM pigment-manufacturing facilities.

As discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the 
plausible management scenario selected for wastewaters usually is treatment in surface 
impoundments. 
The risks associated with disposing these wastewaters in surface impoundments would be 
very high. Two hazardous constituents (aniline and benzidine) are present in the waste at 
concentrations that would pose substantial risks to human health and the environment (

i.e.

, greater 
than 1E-4 for carcinogens) for treatment in a surface impoundment. Large quantities of aniline, 
used in excess, are used as a raw material in this process. As a 
result, very high concentrations of aniline are present in the 
process waters. Even after recovery operations, EPA found high 
concentrations of aniline (in this case, an average of 200 ppm) 
remaining in the wastewater effluent discharged to the POTW. 
Benzidine was found to be present in several wastestreams 
from the manufacture of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as 
a feedstock, and is believed to be either a raw material 
contaminant or a reaction by-product. The risks posed by 
benzidine at the concentrations present in these wastewaters are 
3E-4, using a surface impoundment management scenario. 
The coeluting constituents, 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and 
azobenzene, which are likely by-products arising from the 
oxidation of aniline are present in the waste at a concentration 
resulting in a calculated risk level of 1E-5, based on the 
toxicity of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine (see Section II.D, Description 
of Health and Risk Assessments, for a discussion on the Agency's 
approach to risk assessment for coeluting compounds). The mass 
spectrum representing these two coeluting compounds was 
identified in all three wastewater samples collected from 
triarylmethane pigment operations. 
However, based on the insignificant risks associated with 
the current and plausible management practice for this 
wastestream (treatment in tanks), EPA is proposing not to list 
wastewaters from the production of TAM pigments as hazardous. 
Although this wastestream would be hazardous if used for spray 
irrigation or handled in surface impoundments, the Agency does 
not believe that such management is plausible. The facilities 
generating the wastewater already are 100% invested in treating 
the waste in tanks prior to sending it to a POTW. In addition, 
this is not a strongly expanding segment of the industry, so the 
Agency does not anticipate more facilities starting up similar 
operations. Further, there is a general bias under most State 
industrial waste programs against allowing surface impoundments 
to be built. Thus, based on the risk associated with treatment 
in tanks, the Agency is proposing not to list this wastestream as 
hazardous. 
c. Still bottoms or heavy ends from the production of 
triarylmethane dyes or pigments (K166). 


Summary 


The Agency is proposing to list still bottoms or heavy ends 
from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments as 
hazardous. This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 
261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is capable of 
posing a substantial present or potential risk to human health or 
the environment. Based on ingestion of contaminated ground 
water, EPA calculated high-end individual risk levels (greater 
than 1E-4) for carcinogens under both the baseline and plausible 
management scenarios. Two carcinogens pose high-end risks 
exceeding 9E-3 for the plausible management scenario of disposal 
in an on-site monofill. These two constituents pose very high 
levels of risk (greater than 1E-3) for the baseline management 
practice of disposal in a municipal landfill. In addition, one 
of these constituents has an HQ of 6 for the air pathway 
associated with management in an on-site boiler, a practice which 
is both a baseline management practice and a plausible management 
scenario. 


Discussion 


This wastestream includes distillation bottoms from the 
production of triarylmethane dye and pigments, which are 
generated from solvent and raw material recovery operations 
(

i.e.,

 recovery of aniline, dimethylaniline, or other solvents).

Information relevant to this discussion is not included at 
the present time due to business confidentiality concerns. 
Process waters from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes 
and pigments containing high levels of aniline or other raw 
materials and solvents sometimes are sent to a distillation 
column for recovery of the material for reuse in the process. As 
expected, the bottoms generated from the distillation contain 
high concentrations of the material being recovered. The 
concentrations of aniline present in two samples collected 
exemplify the concentrations of solvent contaminants anticipated 
in these wastes. Information on the concentration of aniline 
observed is not presented at his time due to business 
confidentiality concerns. 
Based on data from the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, 
four facilities generated a total of 1700 metric tons of this 
waste in 1991. 
EPA has summarized the risk projections associated with this 
waste in Table II-11. The data presented in this table represent 
two samples from two facilities. These samples were collected 
from the two largest generators of this wastestream, both of 
which recover aniline from the wastewater. One of the remaining 
two facilities recovers other aniline derivatives (

i.e.,

 N,N- 
dimethylaniline and N,N-diethylaniline) that are used as raw 
materials and solvents in the production of triarylmethane dyes. 
The second facility recovers chlorobenzene used as a solvent in 
the production of triarylmethane dyes and generates a still 
bottom waste that is reported to contain 50% chlorobenzene. This 
waste is already listed as F002, based on the use of the solvent 
chlorobenzene. Based on an evaluation of the processes 
generating these wastes and the contaminants reported to be 
present by industry, the Agency believes the risks posed are 
similar to those assessed in Table II-11. The data used to 
characterize these wastestreams, assess the risks posed by these 
wastes, and make a proposed listing determination on the waste 
grouping were obtained from the two samples collected by EPA and 
the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire responses. Waste 
management information relevant to this discussion are not 
included at the present time due to business confidentiality 
concerns. 
As discussed earlier in Section II.D, Description of Health 
and Risk Assessments, the Agency conducted the risk assessment on 
these wastestreams using the two most widely used practices, the 
on-site boiler and municipal landfill as the current management 
scenario, and an on-site boiler (for the air pathway) and on-site 
monofill (for the ground-water pathway) as the plausible 
management scenario. 
The risk posed by the presence of aniline in the 
concentrations found in the waste is estimated to be very high 
(

i.e., 

greater than 9E-3 for the ground-water pathway, and HQ=6 
for the air pathway). Due to the imperfect nature of any 
recovery process, it is not unexpected that large quantities of 
aniline, or any other raw material or solvent being recovered, 
would be present in these still bottoms. Aniline was found in 
very high concentrations (

i.e.,

 the low concentration was 1.9%) 
in both distillation bottom samples collected from triarylmethane 
pigment production. Information on the high concentration value 
is not included at the present time due to business 
confidentiality concerns. 
In addition to aniline, the two sets of coeluting 
constituents present in the wastewater treatment sludge and 
wastewaters from these operations (

i.e.,

 1,2-diphenylhydrazine 
and azobenzene, and N-nitrosodiphenylamine and diphenylamine) 
also are present in the distillation bottoms (K166). These 
compounds are all likely by-products arising from the oxidation 
of aniline. The MS curve representing 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and 
azobenzene was identified in both distillation bottom samples 
collected from triarylmethane pigment operations. For the 
reasons discussed in Section II.D, the Agency conducted the risk 
assessment for these coeluting compounds independently. The 
resulting high-end individual cancer-risk level for this first 
set of coeluting compounds is greater than 9E-3. Likewise, the 
risk assessment for N-nitrosodiphenylamine and diphenylamine was 
conducted independently, as discussed in Section II.D. The 
resulting high-end individual cancer-risk level for this second 
set of coeluting compounds is 6E-6. 
In addition to assessing the risks associated with the 
individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers 
the combined risks of constituents that co-exist in the 
wastestream. In the case of still bottoms from the production of 
triarylmethane dyes and pigments, all of the constituents are 
believed to co-exist in the wastestream. The distillation 
columns generating this residual process the same wastestream 
with each dye or pigment batch. As a result, the constituents 
detected are likely to be present simultaneously in the waste. 
The risk of each individual constituent is high, and the combined 
risks of these constituents are very high (greater than 9E-3 for 
the ground-water pathway and 6E-5 for the air pathway), both of 
which were considered in making this listing determination. 
In addition to the very high risks posed by the plausible 
management practice (on-site boiler for the air pathway and on-site monofill for the ground-water pathway), the
risks posed by 
the baseline management practice (on-site boiler for the air 
pathway and municipal landfill for the ground-water pathway) are 
also very high. Specifically, the risks posed by the current 
management practices are greater than 9E-3 for the ground-water 
pathway, and 6E-5 (carcinogens) and HQ=6 (non-carcinogens) for 
the air pathway. 
In summary, the calculated risks associated with managing 
these still bottoms in on-site boilers, municipal landfills, and 
on-site monofills are all very high, based on each of the 
individual hazardous constituents in the wastestream and the 
combined risks due to carcinogens found in the wastestream as a 
whole. Therefore, based on the risks associated with both 
current management and plausible management practices for this 
waste, EPA is proposing to list as hazardous still bottoms or 
heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or 
pigments, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K166. 
For the reasons stated above, the Agency is proposing to add 
the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis 
for Listing: 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, azobenzene, aniline, 
diphenylamine, and N-nitrosodiphenylamine. 
In addition, azobenzene and N-nitrosodiphenylamine are 
proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous 
Constituents. 
5.Wastes from the production of anthraquinone dyes 
and pigments. 
a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments. 


Summary 


EPA is proposing to defer the proposed listing determination 
for wastewater treatment sludges from the production of 
anthraquinone dyes and pigments at this time. Based on analysis 
of the sludge samples collected by the Agency, no constituents 
attributable to anthraquinone processes were detected. However, 
data supplied by industry indicate the presence of two 
constituents on the target analyte list for which no health-based 
levels and no adequate surrogates exist. Based on this 
discrepancy and the need to identify surrogates for risk 
analysis, the Agency believes a deferral is appropriate for this 
wastestream. 


Discussion 


This sludge is generated from the treatment of wastewaters 
from anthraquinone dye and pigment manufacturing. Volume 
information reported by industry in the 1992 RCRA 3007 
Questionnaire data is not included at the present time due to 
business confidentiality concerns.

Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of 
anthraquinone dyes and pigments is generated at 11 facilities. 
Sludge generated from 9 of the 11 facilities, which represents 
over 98% of the anthraquinone dye and pigment production volume, 
is commingled with wastewater treatment sludge from the 
production of azo pigments and/or dyes. Over 98% of the 
commingled sludge currently is managed in municipal landfills or 
is disposed in on-site monofills. Small fractions of the 
commingled sludge are managed under Subtitle C. Waste management 
and waste volume information relevant to this discussion is not 
included at the present time due to business confidentiality 
concerns. 
Of the 11 facilities that generate this waste, the Agency 
collected samples from the three largest contributors to the 
wastestream and from one small contributor. Several compounds 
used in anthraquinone dye or pigment operations were expected to 
be present in the waste, based on facility production schedules, 
and were not detected. In addition, analysis of these samples 
did not produce any other contaminants attributable to 
anthraquinone dye or pigment operations (refer to the Background 
Document for this rulemaking located in the RCRA Docket for this 
rule (see 

ADDRESSES

 section) for the methodology used in 
identifying contaminants attributable to a process). 
Several compounds used in the manufacture of anthraquinone 
dyes and pigments were dropped from the Agency's target analyte 
list for dye and pigment wastes, due to the absence of any health 
effects information and because of low usage rates (

i.e

., the 
compound was used at only 1 or 2 facilities). Examples of 
anthraquinone-related compounds dropped from the target analyte 
list for these reasons include: 1-chloroanthraquinone, 1,4- 
dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, 1-amino-2-chloro-4- 
hydroxyanthraquinone, and 1-amino-4-bromo-2-anthraquinonesulfonic 
acid. 
As stated above, the Agency's analysis of wastewater 
treatment sludge samples collected from anthraquinone dye and 
pigment operations did not produce any contaminants attributable 
to anthraquinone dye or pigment operations. However, industry 
data submitted on 11 sludge samples confirmed the presence of two 
target analytes, 1-aminoanthraquinone, and leucoquinizarine, at 
average concentrations of 1.5, and 1.4 ppm, respectively. Each 
of the two analytes was detected in three of the 11 samples. 
The Agency did not find HBLs for either of the two compounds 
detected in this wastestream, 1-aminoanthraquinone and 
leucoquinizarine. In addition, the Agency was not able to 
identify any appropriate surrogate compounds to represent the 
toxicity of these compounds. If one or both of these compounds 
are potential carcinogens and behave in a similar manner to the 
potential carcinogen, 1-amino-2-methyl-anthraquinone, then the 
risk posed by the presence of the compounds in the waste would 
need to be examined further. The Agency is concerned about using 
this limited surrogate information as a basis for listing this 
waste as hazardous. 
In summary, the Agency is proposing to defer a listing 
determination for wastewater treatment sludge from the 
manufacture of anthraquinone dyes and pigments at this time, and 
is requesting data on the toxicity of 1-aminoanthraquinone and 
leucoquinizarine or information on suitable surrogates for these 
compounds. EPA also would be interested in submission of further 
characterization data. EPA will evaluate carefully all public 
comments and information received in response to this notice. 
Based on comments or data received, the Agency, rather than 
deferring, may choose to promulgate a final determination to 
either list or not to list this waste as hazardous under RCRA. 
b. Wastewaters from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments. 


Summary


EPA is proposing not to list wastewaters from the production 
of anthraquinone dyes and pigments as hazardous. This 
wastestream is not considered to pose significant risks to human 
health and the environment, based on the analysis of samples of 
the waste. Several compounds used in the manufacture of 
anthraquinone dyes and pigments were expected to be present in 
the waste but were not detected. Only one compound attributable 
to anthraquinone processes, 3-aminoacetanilide, was detected in 
the waste, at low concentrations. Health effects information on 
this constituent does not currently exist, and risk estimates 
conducted using methylenephenylenediamine as a surrogate indicate 
no significant risks.

Discussion 



Based on response data from the RCRA Section 3007 
Questionnaire, the 1991 volume reported by the industry for 
wastewaters from anthraquinone dye and pigment production was 
3,988,166 metric tons, or approximately 2.9 million gallons per 
day, generated at 25 facilities. Most of the wastewater 
currently is treated and discharged to a surface water under the 
NPDES system; the remainder is discharged to a POTW (with 5% 
pretreated prior to discharge). Additional information on 
volumes and waste managment is not included at the present time 
due to business confidentiality concerns. 

Of the 25 facilities that generate this waste, the Agency 
collected a total of seven samples from the four largest 
contributors to the wastestream and from one small contributor. 
Information relevant to this discussion is not included at the 
present time due to business confidentiality concerns. 

As stated above, several compounds used in anthraquinone dye 
and pigment operations were expected to be present in the waste, 
based on facility production schedules, and were not detected. 
In addition, only one compound attributable to anthraquinone dye 
and pigment production was detected in the waste (refer to the 
Background Document for this rulemaking located in the RCRA 
Docket for this rule (see 

ADDRESSES

 section) for the methodology 
used in identifying contaminants attributable to a process). 
This compound, 3-aminoacetanilide, was present in five of the 
seven samples collected, at an average concentration of 0.15 ppm. 
However, health effects information needed to assess the risk 
posed by this constituent does not currently exist. In order to 
estimate the potential risk from 3-aminoacetanilide, the Agency 
performed a risk assessment using methylenephenylenediamine as a 
surrogate compound. The Agency selected a surrogate compound 
that is structurally similar to the compound detected in the 
waste (

i.e.

, 3-aminoacetanilide), and is estimated, by means of 
structural activity relationships (SARs), to be more toxic than 
the subject compound. This assessment produced a groundwater 
concentration, prior to dilution and attenuation, of 1.5 times 
the HBL. Thus, the concentration at the receptor well, following 
dilution and attenuation, would be expected to be less than the 
HBL. More detailed discussions on the risk assessment screening 
and surrogate compounds are presented in Section II.D of this 
preamble, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, and the 
Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, which is 
located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (see 

ADDRESSES

 
section). 

In conclusion, because the one compound attributable to 
anthraquinone dye or pigment production detected in this waste is 
present in low concentrations, does not have health data needed 
to assess risk, and does not indicate a risk using surrogate 
toxicity data, the Agency is proposing not to list wastewaters 
from the manufacture of anthraquinone dyes and pigments as 
hazardous. 

6.Wastewaters from the production of FD&C colorants. 



Summary 



EPA is proposing not to list wastewaters from the production 
of FD&C colorants as hazardous wastes. This wastestream is not 
considered to pose significant risks to human health and the 
environment, based on the analysis of samples of the waste. Only 
three constituents attributable to FD&C colorant processes were 
detected in the waste, and these do not present a risk at the 
concentrations observed. 



Discussion 



Based on the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, the 
volume reported by the industry for the wastewater stream from 
FD&C colorant production is 3,557,563 metric tons per year, or 
2.6 million gallons per day. Information on the percentage of 
these wastewaters that are currently pretreated and discharged to 
a POTW and other waste management information relevant to this 
discussion is not included at the present time due to business 
confidentiality concerns. 

The Agency collected three samples of wastewaters generated 
from FD&C operations and did not find any hazardous constituents 
present at concentrations that pose a risk above EPA's initial 
risk ``level of concern'' (

i.e.

, 1E-5 for carcinogens, and HQ of 1 
or greater). The Agency believes that the samples of wastewaters 
from the manufacture of FD&C colorants are representative of the 
industry. In fact, wastewater samples were collected from the 
two largest-volume FD&C colorant producers in the country, in 
addition to one smaller manufacturer. 

Several of the raw materials used in the manufacture of FD&C 
colorants were dropped from the Agency's target analyte list for 
analysis of dye and pigment wastes because the few existing 
health studies on these compounds indicate that the compounds are 
non-toxic. In addition, many of the raw materials used in the 
manufacture of FD&C colorants are compounds that contain sulfonic 
acid functional groups, for which analytical methods do not 
exist. Examples of FD&C raw materials dropped from the target 
analyte list for these reasons include 

p

-toluidine-

m

-sulfonic 
acid, and sulfanilic acid. 

The sulfonic acid functional group imparts water solubility 
to a compound, which generally results in lower toxicity. 
However, several of these materials may pose a risk when present 
in the wastestream without the sulfonic acid functional group. 
For example, without sulfonic acid functional groups, the two 
compounds listed above (

p

-toluidine-

m

-sulfonic acid and 
sulfanilic acid) are represented by 

p

-toluidine, and aniline, 
respectively. In these cases, the precursors to the FD&C 
reactants (

i.e.

, prior to sulfonation) remained as target 
analytes even when the sulfonated compounds were not on the list. 
Information relevant to this discussion is not included due to 
business confidentiality concerns. (Refer to the Dye and Pigment 
Listing Background Document, located in the RCRA Docket for this 
proposed rulemaking (see 

ADDRESSES

 section), for details on the 
development of the target analyte list.)

From the three FD&C wastewater samples collected, the 
following three constituents were observed that are attributable 
to FD&C colorant production: Aniline, 3-hydroxyphenol, and 
phenol. During the risk assessment screening, the Agency found 
that the three constituents present in the waste (

i.e.,

 aniline, 
3-hydroxyphenol, and phenol) do not pose a risk at the 
concentrations detected. In fact, the ratios of maximum measured 
concentration in the wastestream to the HBL were less than 1 for 
aniline and phenol. Since there currently is no HBL available 
for 3-hydroxyphenol, the concentration of 3-hydroxyphenol was 
compared to that of a surrogate. 3-Hydroxyphenol is not expected 
to be a potential carcinogen. Furthermore, the Agency selected a 
surrogate compound that is structurally similar to the compound 
detected in the waste, and is estimated, by means of structural 
activity relationships (SARs), to be more toxic than the subject 
compound. Therefore, phenol was selected as a surrogate for this 
3-hydroxyphenol, and the resulting ratio of concentration to HBL 
was also less than 1. This indicates that if the contaminant 
concentrations found in the waste were actually present in 
drinking water, the risks posed by ingesting the drinking water 
would be insignificant. 

In conclusion, because the constituents in this wastestream 
were observed at concentrations that present insignificant risks, 
and no other hazardous constituents attributed to FD&C colorant 
production were detected, the Agency is proposing not to list 
wastewaters from the manufacture of FD&C colorants as hazardous. 

7. Dusts and dust collector fines from the 
manufacture of dyes and pigments. 



Summary 



The Agency is proposing not to list dusts and dust collector 
fines from the manufacture of dyes and pigments because, based on 
an evaluation of current management and plausible management, 
this waste does not pose a substantial potential hazard to human 
health and the environment. 



Discussion 



Dusts and dust collector fines are generated during drying, 
grinding, and blending operations that occur during the 
manufacture of dyes and pigments. Dust collectors and baghouses 
generally are used to capture and collect the dust. The total 
volume of this wastestream reported in response to the 1991 RCRA 
Section 3007 Questionnaire is 143 metric tons. According to 
questionnaire data, some of the dusts and fines reported by the 
industry are recovered and recycled back to the manufacturing 
process or sold to shoe-polish manufacturers as a raw material. 
Information on the percentage handled in this manner is not 
included at the present time due to business confidentiality 
concerns. There is a distinct economic incentive for these 
facilities to continue reusing or selling dusts and fines in this 
way. This handling of dusts and fines is not expected to present 
any significant risk to human health and the environment. 

Seventeen percent of the reported waste volume is generated 
by a facility that currently manages dusts and fines in a 
Subtitle C landfill and the Agency believes that this facility 
will continue to manage dusts and fines in such a manner. The 
dusts and fines generated at this facility from organic pigments 
covered by this listing determination are mixed with dusts and 
fines from inorganic pigments that contain lead and chromium. 
The entire volume of dusts and fines, comprised of the commingled 
organic and inorganic products dusts and fines, is 
characteristically toxic for both lead and chromium and, 
therefore, is a hazardous waste as defined by 40 CFR 261.24. It 
is impractical for the facility to separate the dusts and fines 
covered by this listing determination from these characteristic 
inorganic dusts and fines and, thus, the facility manages the 
dusts and fines covered by this listing determination in a 
Subtitle C landfill. Analysis of existing plant design shows 
that dusts and fines are comingled in ductwork that is structured 
such that these wastes are mixed. Without significant re-design 
and construction, segregation of the wastes is impossible. The 
Agency does not believe that it is plausible for the facility to 
discontinue the practice of combining all of its dusts and fines 
wastes and disposing of such wastes at a Subtitle C facility 
given the physical arrangement of this facility. Management of 
this waste in a Subtitle C landfill is not expected to pose any 
significant level of risk to human health or the environment. 

Information on the volume and the percentage of total volume 
disposed of in Subtitle D landfills is not included at the 
present time due to business confidentiality concerns. 

The Agency believes the potential risks posed by the 
plausible management practices for this volume do not warrant a 
hazardous waste listing for dusts and fines. 

Although, due to resource constraints, the Agency was unable 
to collect information on the characteristics of these dusts and 
fines, the Agency estimated a worst-case risk by estimating the 
risk associated with disposal of dusts and fines in a Subtitle D 
landfill based on the physical/chemical properties of a mobile 
dye product and the toxicological properties of a dye constituent 
known to be one of the most toxic and mobile dye or pigment waste 
constituents. This analysis demonstrated that the risk is below 
the initial level of concern associated with disposal of this 
waste in a Subtitle D landfill. Management of this waste in an 
on-site monofill was determined to be not plausible because the 
volumes generated would not justify an on-site monofill. For 
further information see the background document on risk 
assessment, available in the public docket for this rule. 

The Agency requests comment on the approach used to 
determine risk posed by plausible management of the wastes and 
requests comment on the proposed determination not to list this 
waste.

9. Spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth, or 
adsorbents used in the production of azo, 
anthraquinone, or triarylmethane dyes, pigments, 
or FD&C colorants. 



Summary 



The Agency is proposing to defer a determination on whether 
to list spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth, or adsorbents used 
in the production of azo, anthraquinone, or triarylmethane dyes, 
pigments, or FD&C colorants as hazardous due to insufficient 
waste characterization data. The Agency is planning to collect 
additional information on this wastestream. EPA then will 
publish a supplemental notice with a proposed determination on 
whether to list this waste. 



III. Waste Minimization 



In the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101 

et 
seq., 

Pub. L. 101-508, November 5, 1990), Congress declared 
pollution prevention the national policy of the United States. 
The act declares that pollution should be prevented or reduced 
whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented should be 
recycled or reused in an environmentally safe manner wherever 
feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented/reduced or recycled 
should be treated; and disposal or release into the environment 
should be chosen only as a last resort. This section first 
provides a general discussion of some generic pollution 
prevention and waste minimization techniques that facilities may 
wish to explore and second discusses and requests comment on ways 
in which the hazardous waste listing determination program itself 
could be structured to better promote pollution prevention and 
waste minimization. 



A. Generic Approaches to Waste Minimization 



Waste minimization practices fall into three general groups: 
change in production practices, housekeeping practices, and 
practices that employ the use of equipment that by design promote 
waste minimization. Some of these practices/equipment listed 
below conserve water, others reduce the amount of product in the 
wastestream, while others may prevent the creation of the waste 
altogether. EPA acknowledges that some of these 
practices/equipment may lead to media transfers or increased 
energy consumption. This information is presented for general 
information, and is not being proposed as a regulatory 
requirement. Production practices include: 
 Triple-rinsing raw material shipping containers and 
returning the rinsate directly to the reactor; 
 Scheduling production to minimize changeover cleanouts; 
 Segregating equipment by individual product or product 
``families;'' 
 Packaging products directly out of reactors; 
 Steam stripping wastewaters to recovery reactants or 
solvents for reuse; 
 Using raw material drums for packaging final products; 
and 
 Dedicating equipment for hard to clean products. 
Housekeeping practices include: 
 Performing preventive maintenance on all valves, 
fittings, and pumps; 
 Promptly correcting any leaky valves and fittings; 
 Placing drip pans under valves and fittings to contain 
leaks; and

 Cleaning up spills or leaks in bulk containment areas to prevent contamination of storm or wash wasters.






Equipment promoting waste minimization by reducing or eliminating waste generation include:



 Low-volume/high-pressure hoses for cleaning;

 Drum triple-rinsing stations;

 Reactor scrubber systems designed to return captured reactants to the next batch rather than to disposal;

 Material storage tanks with inert liners to prevent contamination of water blankets with contaminants which
would prohibit its use in the process; and

 Enclosed automated product handling equipment to eliminate manual product packaging.

Waste minimization measures can be tailored to the needs of individual industries, processes, and firms. This approach
may make it possible to achieve greater pollution reduction with less cost and disruption to the firm.

Defined process control and good housekeeping practices often can result in significant waste volume or toxicity
reduction. Evaluations of existing processes also may point out the need for more complex engineering approaches
(

e.g.

, waste reuse, secondary processing of distillation bottoms, and use of vacuum pumps instead of steam jets) to achieve
waste minimization objectives. Simple physical audits of current waste generation and in-plant management practices
for the wastes also can yield positive results. These audits often turn up simple non-engineering practices that
can be implemented successfully.



B. Waste Minimization Approaches in the Listing Program



Section 1003 of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 says that one of RCRA's goals is to promote protection
of human health and the environment and to conserve valuable material and energy resources by ``minimizing the generation
of hazardous waste and the land disposal of hazardous waste by encouraging process substitution, materials recovery,
properly conducted recycling, and reuse and treatment.'' Section 1003 further provides that it is a national policy
of the United States that, whenever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste is to be reduced or eliminated as expeditiously
as possible. To further EPA's waste minimization goals, the Waste Minimization Branch (WMB) in EPA's Office of Solid
Waste (OSW) established the RCRA Waste Minimization Action Plan to integrate source reduction and recycling into
the National RCRA Program, and RCRA activities into the Agency's Pollution Prevention Strategy.

As described in that plan, EPA's program for evaluating which wastes should be listed as hazardous is an example of
a regulatory program that can provide opportunities for encouraging and promoting real waste minimization. When
a wastestream is listed as hazardous, it enters the hazardous waste management system. The requirements of that system
can be costly and there are currently only limited ways for a waste entering the system to get out. Once it is listed as
a hazardous waste, it remains a listed hazardous waste even after treatment and safe disposal, unless delisted pursuant
to 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22. Other than levels at which wastes typically are delisted, there is no target for a generator
to shoot for which would allow their waste to be considered non-hazardous even if waste minimization actions are taken
that ensure the waste is not likely to pose a hazard to human health and the environment. However, if a waste minimization-based
exemption to the listing could be provided, generators would have the regulatory and economic incentive to meet the
exemption. When the exemption is tailored to encourage and reward waste minimization efforts, then the generator
could obtain the benefit of not generating a listed hazardous waste while furthering national waste minimization
goals.

The Agency notes that there are several important considerations in developing listing determinations that encourage
waste minimization. First, waste minimization-based listings must promote actual waste minimization and clearly
not increase risk. In addition, the listings must be enforceable.

1. Actual Waste Minimization Must Occur. The Agency is interested in taking comment on developing listings that encourage
reductions in volumes, reductions in concentrations of constituents of concern (without diluting constituents
in an effort to reduce concentration), reductions in environmental loading of constituents of concern, and/or the
removal of constituents of concern (or process derivatives of concern) from the manufacturing process, and/or the
beneficial reuse, recycling, or reclamation of the wastestreams themselves, provided human health and the environment
is protected. A waste minimization-based listing, for example, must be crafted so as not to result simply in cross-media
transfer, and so as not to leave uncontrolled wastes reduced in volume or concentration, but still posing a significant
hazard. The Agency believes that generators must make a commitment that waste minimization in fact would occur, and
that a real investment in waste minimization techniques, equipment, and process changes would be carried out.

2. No Increase in Risk Can Occur. A waste minimization-based listing (or variable level) must protect human health
and the environment and not increase risk. A hazardous waste listing achieves the goal of minimizing risk by placing
a wastestream in the hazardous waste management system. Any exemption which takes a wastestream out of this system
must be shown to provide an equivalent decrease in risk as that provided by the listing itself. It would be unacceptable,
for example, for waste minimization actions simply to result in cross-media transfer of wastes. Chemical substitution
that fails to reduce the risks posed by a wastestream is another example of a practice that would not be considered to
be waste minimization. Another specific concern involves the possible presence of other constituents in a wastestream
for which the waste was not specifically listed but which also may pose risk to human health or the environment. A waste
minimization-based listing must consider the impact of letting the entire wastestream out of the hazardous waste
management system.

3. Enforceability. The Agency is particularly concerned about the enforceability of waste minimization-based
variance to a listing. In particular, the Agency has concerns about the following factors:

 The amount of testing or monitoring required,

 Ease by which a State inspector could check compliance,

 How a generator would demonstrate compliance with the waste minimization-based exemption,

 The likelihood that a State agency would adopt a waste minimization approach in its listing regulations, and

 The ability of a State agency to oversee an exemption.






Any waste minimization-based listing must account for these concerns. (Many of these issues now are being considered
in EPA's deliberations on the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule.)

C. Specific Approaches to Waste Minimization 



The Agency can and has used different regulatory mechanisms 
to promote waste minimization in the listing program. The 
discussion below will describe several options the Agency has 
identified as an approach to tailoring listings that encourages 
generators to use waste minimization practices. This approach 
could apply to any listing determination. Also included in this 
discussion are specific references to today's proposed listing 
determination for dyes and pigments. 



Quantity-Based Listings 



A potential method of structuring a waste listing to promote 
waste minimization would be to establish a quantity-based 
exemption for the wastes listed. Under such an approach, the 
listing of a specific wastestream would be accompanied by a 
quantity-based exemption for the specific wastestream involved. 
Quantity can refer to either a concentration of constituents in a 
waste (measured or calculated) or the mass of constituents 
released to the environment. The Agency believes that this 
approach would encourage waste minimization because a facility 
would have to meet a risk-based quantitation target for a 
wastestream in order to qualify for the exemption, thereby 
requiring reductions in the mass or concentration (or both) of 
the constituents of concern. In reducing mass loading or 
concentration (or both) of the wastes, the Agency's waste 
minimization goals are achieved. 

A concentration basis is easier to measure and track than a 
limit based on loading or mass. Setting a limit based on 
loadings or mass addresses total loadings to the environment and 
recognizes waste minimization efforts that result in reductions 
in both mass of pollutant and volume of total wastestream. 
However, a mass loading approach poses significantly more burden 
in terms of monitoring and compliance and may not take into 
account concentrations of constituents in a waste. The Agency 
requests comment on the use of production or mass-based limits, 
and on possible monitoring approaches. 

A variation on this approach is an adaptation of the 
``headworks rule'' (40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv)(A)-(E)) to a listing. 
The original rule, promulgated on November 17, 1981 (46 FR 56582) 
allows for calculated amounts of certain spent solvents, 
commercial chemical products, petroleum refining wastes, and 
laboratory residuals to be sent to a facility's wastewater 
treatment plant, and for the wastewaters and sludges (beyond the 
headworks) to be exempted from the mixture rule. The Agency also 
proposed in the March 1, 1994 carbamates listing proposal 
(59 FR 9808-9864) to provide a similar exemption to a wastewater 
proposed for listing in the same notice. 

Under the ``headworks'' exemption approach (

e.g., 

40 CFR 
261.3(a)(2)(iv)(H)), the wastewaters and treatment sludges would 
be exempt from the listing as long as the industry could show 
that the total quantity of hazardous constituents that pose risk 
in a wastestream, divided by the undiluted wastewater flow for 
wastewaters on an average weekly basis from the particular 
product process subject to the listing was less than a calculated 
quantity. The calculated quantity would be based on a risk 
assessment. 

The Agency would have to be able to determine the 
relationship between the amount of raw material used and the 
presence of particular constituents in the wastestream. The 
Agency requests comment on whether determining such a 
relationship is feasible for the dye and pigment industries. To 
qualify for such an exemption, the facility would have to use 
existing inventory records of raw materials that go into the 
process. The facility can subtract the quantity of materials 
that, in fact, do not go into the wastewater treatment system, 
either by chemical reaction or material recovery techniques 
(

i.e., 

distillation, reuse, reverse osmosis, etc.). The facility 
may not subtract any quantity assumed to volatilize. The 
quantity of material left then would be converted to resulting 
levels of constituents expected to be generated based on quantity 
of raw material used. The levels of constituents then would be 
divided by the average weekly flow of the wastewaters into the 
headworks of the wastewater treatment system at the time the 
process is being run to determine total concentrations of 
constituents in wastewater. If the total concentration of 
constituents of concern is less than the amount calculated based 
on the risk assessment, the wastewaters and treatment sludges 
would qualify for the exemption. This approach has the advantage 
of determining concentrations in a mathematical, rather than an 
analytical way. The disadvantage is that it requires collection 
of process flow data and specific plant chemistry information. 

The Agency realizes that constituent loading into the 
wastewater treatment system may have to be reduced significantly 
(up to two to three orders of magnitude in many cases) in order 
to qualify for an exemption of this sort. Therefore, the Agency 
solicits comment on whether such levels are achievable, and what 
other calculation methods may exist (such as one based on 
production mass). 

Such an exemption would apply only after the wastewaters 
have arrived at the headworks of a facility's wastewater 
treatment system. The Agency would not allow it to apply to 
wastewaters before they reach the headworks. Generators who wish 
to qualify for such an exemption would be required to use flow 
statistics for the period in which the processes generating the 
wastewaters are being run. Finally, such an exemption would 
apply only to wastewater flow for that wastestream, not to flow 
figures from unrelated processes that serve only to dilute the 
wastewaters. 

In addition, generators would be required to keep records of 
average weekly flow in the production processes, especially when 
the processes generating the listed wastewaters are run. When 
land disposal restrictions are applied to a waste subject to such 
an exemption, generators would need to comply with 
40 CFR 268.7(a)(6), which states that the generator who has 
produced a waste subject to an exemption in 40 CFR 261.2-261.6 
must keep a notification in the facility's file stating that such 
a waste has been generated, the fact that it is restricted, and 
the disposition of the waste.

The Agency seeks comment on the recordkeeping burden that accompanies its implementation. The Agency realizes that
facilities that would wish to take advantage of such an exemption would be required to allow compliance personnel
to examine process records (reaction rates, reactants, process flows, etc.) to verify that a facility is able to achieve
the exemption. Therefore, the Agency solicits comments on this topic as well.

A quantity-based exemption in a listing determination bears a strong relationship to another ongoing Agency project
which seeks to establish an exit from the hazardous waste management program. The Hazardous Waste Identification
Rule (HWIR) project is an effort, in part, to set exit criteria for any listed hazardous waste so that materials which
clearly fail to pose a threat to human health and the environment can exit the Subtitle C system. The HWIR concept, as
currently envisioned, would be expected to be similar to that of a quantity-based exemption for a specific listed
hazardous waste: a risk- based exemption process that employs analysis of multiple exposure pathways to determine
a safe exit or exemption level. A principal difference between the HWIR concept under discussion and a quantity-based
listing could be that HWIR is meant to apply to all listed wastestreams, while a quantity-based listing could be targeted
to a specific wastestream in a listing determination. In that sense, a listing exemption could be considered to be
more tailored to the known exposure routes of a specific wastestream and may be able to generate an exemption level
which is specific to that wastestream. For example, if the listing determination analysis shows a wastestream in
a listing can be managed only in tanks, then the exemption analysis could be focused on the exposure pathways affected
only by tanks. The exemption levels for that wastestream could be tailored to those exposure routes (air pathways)
and could be different than HWIR exit criteria. The Agency solicits comment on the advantages and disadvantages of
a quantity-based exemption in listing determinations to a more generic exit level lkie that being contemplated in
the HWIR project discussions.



Relationship to the Definition of Solid Waste



The Agency has observed in the dye and pigment and other industries that material recovery may be discouraged due to
restrictions placed on materials designated as ``solid and then hazardous'' waste, as defined by RCRA. Over the past
two years, the Agency's Definition of Solid Waste Task Force in the Office of Solid Waste examined possible modifications
to the definition of solid waste to encourage environmentally sound recycling. A final report of the Task Force was
issued on September 19, 1994.

An example in the dye and pigment industries of using as a product a material that ordinarily would be a waste involves
the blending and sale of collected dusts and fines as inexpensive black pigments useful to shoe polish manufacturers.



D. Waste Minimization and the Dye and Pigment Industries



The dye and pigment industries have expended considerable effort to cooperate with the Agency on a voluntary waste
minimization program, coordinated through ETAD. As part of this effort, waste minimization, recycle, and reuse
practices in the dye and pigment industries were described for all aspects of production in the ``Pollution Prevention
Guidance Manual for the Dye Manufacturing Industry'' (EPA/741/B-92-001).

The Agency is interested in options to modify today's proposed listing determinations to support and enhance the
voluntary waste minimization efforts already initiated by the dye and pigment industries. The Agency requests comment
on the feasibility of the waste minimization-based listing approaches described above for the dye and pigment industries.
EPA also solicits ideas and comments on other possible approaches to tailor the hazardous waste listings and promote
waste minimization in the dye and pigment industries. In particular, the Agency requests comment on other approaches
that may provide more flexibility for waste minimization and better assure that constituent reductions would be
achieved through waste minimization (rather than through treatment).

EPA specifically requests comment on the feasibility of developing the quantity-based listing approach described
above for the dye and pigment industries. The quantity-based approach is based on the Agency's experience with other
industries in which production is continuous. Because of the batch nature of production and the multiplicity of chemicals
involved in the dye and pigment industries, the quantity-based listing approach may be more difficult for this industry.
The Agency requests comment on how these issues (

i.e., 

batch processes, multiple chemicals) might be addressed in a quantity-based listing approach or other waste minimization-based
option.

The Agency also solicits comment on whether certain of the dye and pigment wastestreams are better candidates for
waste minimization, and whether a waste minimization-based listing approach should target these wastes. Finally,
EPA requests comment on the testing and monitoring needed to ensure proper implementation of a waste minimization
listing approach. Based on the comments the Agency receives on the above issues, EPA may issue a supplemental proposal
addressing a waste minimization-based listing approach for the dyes and pigments industry.



IV. Applicability of the Land Disposal Restrictions Determinations



A. Request for Comment on the Agency's Approach to the Development of BDAT Treatment Standards



RCRA requires EPA to make a land disposal prohibition determination for any hazardous waste that is newly identified
or listed in 40 CFR part 261 after November 8, 1984, within six months of the date of identification or final listing
(RCRA Section 3004(g)(4), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(4)). EPA also is required to set ``* * * levels or methods
of treatment, if any, which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood
of migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that short-term and long-term threats to human health and
the environment are minimized'' (RCRA Section 3004(m)(1), 42 U.S.C. 6924(m)(1)). Land disposal of wastes that meet
treatment standards thus established by EPA is not prohibited. The wastes being proposed for listing in this action
would be subject to this requirement once a final rule is promulgated.

A general overview of the Agency's approach in performing analysis of how to develop treatment standards for hazardous
wastes can be found in greater detail in Section III.A.1 of the preamble to the final rule that set land disposal restrictions
(LDR's) for the Third Third wastes (55 FR 22535, June 1, 1990). The framework for the development of the entire Land
Disposal Restrictions program was promulgated November 7, 1986. (51 FR 40572).

While the Agency prefers source reduction/pollution prevention and recycling/recovery over conventional treatment,
inevitably, some wastes (such as residues from recycling and inadvertent spill residues) will be generated. Thus,
standards based on treatment using ``best demonstrated available technology'' (BDAT) will be required to be developed
for these wastes if a final rule listing them as hazardous is promulgated.

Treatment standards typically are established based on the performance data from the treatment of the listed waste
or wastes with similar chemical and physical characteristics or similar concentrations of hazardous constituents.
Treatment standards are established for both wastewater and nonwastewater forms on a constituent-specific basis.
The constituents selected for regulation under the Land Disposal Restrictions Program are not necessarily limited
to those identified as present in the listings proposed in this action, but include those constituents or parameters
that will ensure that the technologies are operated properly.

Although data on waste characteristics and current management practices for wastes proposed in this action have
been gathered as part of the administrative record for this rule, the Agency has not completed its evaluation of the
usefulness of these data for developing specific treatment standards or assessing the capacity to treat (or recycle)
these wastes.

Some treatment technologies previously promulgated for newly identified hazardous organic wastes are: chemical
oxidation, wet air oxidation, activated sludge, steam stripping, activated carbon, solvent extraction, pyrolysis,
thermal desorption, UV photolysis, ozonation, and incineration. A current description of these technologies and
what types of wastes they are used to treat is available as a background document and can be obtained by contacting NTIS
(National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161, (703)487-4650) and
requesting document PB91-160556, ``Treatment Technology Document,'' L. Rosengrant, dated January, 1991,
USEPA-OSW.

EPA intends to propose treatment standards for K162 through 
K166 in a separate rulemaking. However, EPA specifically is 
soliciting comment and data on the following as they pertain to 
the proposed listing of dye and pigment industries wastes K162 
through K166 as described in this action: 
(1) Technical descriptions of treatment systems that are or 
could be used potentially for these wastes; 
(2) Descriptions of alternative technologies that currently 
might be available or anticipated as applicable; 
(3) Performance data for the treatment of these or similar 
wastes (in particular, constituent concentrations in 
both treated and untreated wastes, as well as equipment 
design and operating conditions); 
(4) Information on known or perceived difficulties in 
analyzing treatment residues or specific constituents; 
(5) Quality assurance/quality control information for all 
data submissions; 
(6) Factors affecting on-site and off-site treatment 
capacity; 
(7) Information on the potential costs for set-up and 
operation of any current and alternative treatment 
technologies for these wastes; 
(8) Information on waste minimization approaches. 



B. Request for Comment on the Agency's Approach to the 
Capacity Analyses in the LDR Program 



In the land disposal restrictions determinations, the Agency 
must demonstrate that adequate treatment or recovery capacity 
exists to manage a newly listed waste with BDAT standards before 
it can restrict the waste from further land disposal. The Agency 
performs capacity analyses to determine if sufficient alternative 
treatment or recovery capacity exists to accommodate the volumes 
of waste that will be affected by the land disposal prohibition. 
If adequate capacity exists, the waste must be treated to meet 
the BDAT standard before land disposal. If adequate capacity 
does not exist, RCRA Section 3004(h) authorizes EPA to grant a 
national capacity variance from the effective date of the 
treatment standard for the waste for up to two years or until 
adequate alternative treatment capacity becomes available, 
whichever is sooner. 

To perform capacity analyses, the Agency needs to determine 
the volume of the listed waste that will require treatment prior 
to land disposal. The volume of waste requiring treatment 
depends, in turn, on the waste management practices employed by 
the listed waste generators. Data on waste management practices 
for these wastes were collected during the development of this 
proposed rule. However, as the regulatory process proceeds, 
generators may decide to minimize or recycle their wastes or 
otherwise alter their management practices. Thus, EPA will 
update and monitor changes in management practices because these 
changes will affect the final volume of waste requiring 
commercial treatment capacity. Therefore, EPA needs information 
on current and future waste management practices for these 
wastes, including the volume of waste that are recycled, mixed 
with or co-managed with other waste and discharged under Clean 
Water Act provisions; and the volume and types of residuals that 
are generated by various management practices applicable to newly 
listed and identified wastes (

e.g.

, treatment residuals).

The availability of commercial treatment capacity for these 
wastes determines whether or not a waste is granted a capacity 
variance under RCRA Section 3004(h). EPA continues to update and 
monitor changes in available commercial treatment capacity 
because the commercial hazardous waste management industry is 
extremely dynamic. For example, national commercial treatment 
capacity changes as new facilities come on-line, as new units and 
new technologies are added at existing facilities, and as 
facilities expand existing units. The available capacity at 
commercial facilities also changes as facilities change their 
commercial status (

e.g.

, changing from a fully commercial to a 
limited commercial or captive facility). To determine the 
availability of capacity for treating these wastes, the Agency 
needs to consider currently available data, as well as the timing 
of any future changes in available capacity. 

For previous land disposal restriction rules, the Agency 
performed capacity analyses using data from national surveys, 
including the 1987 National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, 
Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities (the TSDR Survey) and 
the 1987 National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators (the 
Generator Survey). However, these surveys cannot be used to 
determine the volumes of dye and pigment wastes requiring 
treatment since these wastes were not included in the surveys. 
Additionally, these surveys may not contain adequate information 
on currently available capacity to treat newly identified wastes 
because the data reflect 1986 capacity and do not include 
facility expansions or closures that have occurred since then. 
Although adjustments have been made to commercially available 
capacity to account for changes in waste management through 1992, 
this was not done on a consistent basis across all waste 
management practices. 

EPA gathered data on waste generation, characteristics and 
management practices for the listing determination of dye and 
pigment wastes in the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire of 1991. 
The Agency has compiled the capacity-related information from the 
survey responses and is soliciting any updated or additional 
pertinent information. 

To perform the necessary capacity analyses in the land 
disposal restrictions rulemaking, the Agency needs reliable data 
on current waste generation, waste management practices, 
available alternative treatment capacity, and planned treatment 
capacity. The Agency will need the annual generation volumes of 
waste by each waste code including wastewater and nonwastewater 
forms, and soil or debris contaminated with these wastes and the 
quantities stored, treated, recycled, or disposed due to any 
change of management practices. EPA also requests data from 
facilities capable of treating these wastes on their current 
treatment capacity and any plans they may have in the future to 
expand or reduce existing capacity. Specifically, the Agency 
requests information on the determining factors involved in 
making decisions to build new treatment capacity. Waste 
characteristics such as pH level, BTUs, anionic character, total 
organic carbon content, constituents concentration, and physical 
form also may limit the availability of certain treatment 
technologies. For these reasons, the Agency requests data and 
comments on waste characteristics that might limit or preclude 
the use of any treatment technologies. 


V. Compliance Dates 


A. Notification 


Under RCRA Section 3010, any person generating, 
transporting, or managing a hazardous waste must notify EPA (or 
an authorized State) of its activities. Section 3010(a) allows 
EPA to waive, under certain circumstances, the notification 
requirement under Section 3010 of RCRA. If these hazardous waste 
listings are promulgated, EPA is proposing to waive the 
notification requirement as unnecessary for persons already 
identified within the hazardous waste management universe (

i.e.

, 
persons who have an EPA identification number under 40 CFR 
262.12). EPA is not proposing to waive the notification 
requirement for waste handlers who have neither notified the 
Agency that they may manage hazardous wastes nor received an EPA 
identification number. Such individuals will have to provide 
notification under RCRA Section 3010. 


B. Interim Status and Permitted Facilities 


Because HSWA requirements are applicable in authorized 
States at the same time as in unauthorized States, EPA will 
regulate EPA Hazardous Wastes Nos. K162 through K166 until States 
are authorized to regulate these wastes. Thus, once this 
regulation becomes effective as a final rule, EPA will apply 
Federal regulations to these wastes and to their management in 
both authorized and unauthorized States. 


VI. State Authority 


A. Applicability of Rule in Authorized States 


Under Section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified 
States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the 
State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements 
for authorization.) Following authorization, EPA retains 
enforcement authority under Sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 
of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement 
responsibility. 
Before the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 
(HSWA) amended RCRA, a State with final authorization 
administered its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of the 
Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no 
longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue 
permits for any facilities located in the State with permitting 
authorization. When new, more stringent Federal requirements 
were promulgated or enacted, the State was obligated to enact 
equivalent authority within specified time-frames. New Federal 
requirements did not take effect in an authorized State until the 
State adopted the requirements as State law.

<DOCNO> FR941222-1-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

By contrast, under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA
(including the hazardous waste listings proposed in this notice) take effect in authorized States at the same time
that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directed to implement those requirements and prohibitions
in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization to do so. While
States still must adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, the Federal HSWA requirements
apply in authorized 
States in the interim. 



B. Effect on State Authorizations 



Because this proposal (with the exception of the actions proposed under CERCLA authority) will be promulgated pursuant
to the HSWA, a State submitting a program modification is able to apply to receive either interim or final authorization
under Section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively, on the basis of requirements that are substantially equivalent
or equivalent to EPA's requirements. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications under Section
3006(b) are described in 40 CFR 271.21. It should be noted that all HSWA interim authorizations currently are scheduled
to expire on January 1, 2003 (see 57 FR 60129, February 18, 1992). 

Section 271.21(e)(2) of EPA's state authorization regulations (40 CFR part 271) requires that States with final
authorization modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and submit the modifications to EPA for approval.
The deadline by which the States must modify their programs to adopt this proposed regulation, if it is adopted as a
final rule, will be determined by the date of promulgation of a final rule in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2). If
the proposal is adopted as a final rule, Table 1 at 40 CFR 271.1 will be amended accordingly. Once EPA approves the modification,
the State requirements become RCRA Subtitle C requirements. 

States with authorized RCRA programs already may have regulations similar to those in this proposed rule. These State
regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed to determine whether they meet
the tests for authorization. Thus, a State would not be authorized to implement these regulations as RCRA requirements
until State program modifications are submitted to EPA and approved, pursuant to 40 CFR 271.21. Of course, States
with existing regulations that are more stringent than or broader in scope than current Federal regulations may continue
to administer and enforce their regulations as a matter of State law. 

It should be noted that authorized States are required to modify their programs only when EPA promulgates Federal
standards that are more stringent or broader in scope than existing Federal standards. Section 3009 of RCRA allows
States to impose standards more stringent than those in the Federal program. For those Federal program changes that
are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. See
40 CFR 271.21(e). This proposed rule, if promulgated, would expand the scope of the Federal program by adding additional
listed wastes. Therefore, States would be required to modify their programs to retain authorization to implement
and enforce these regulations. 



VII. CERCLA Designation and Reportable Quantities 



All hazardous wastes listed under RCRA and codified in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as any solid waste that
exhibits one or more of the characteristics of a RCRA hazardous waste (as defined in Sections 261.21 through 261.24),
are hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA), as amended. See CERCLA Section 101(14)(C). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40
CFR 302.4 along with their reportable quantities (RQs). RQs are the minimum quantity of a hazardous substance that,
if released, must be reported to the National Response Center (NRC) pursuant to CERCLA Section 103. In this action,
the Agency is proposing to list the proposed wastes in this action as CERCLA hazardous substances in Table 302.4 of
40 CFR 302.4, but is taking no action to adjust the one-pound statutory RQs for these substances. 



Reporting Requirements. 

Under Section 102(b) of CERCLA, all hazardous substances newly designated under CERCLA will have a statutory RQ of
one pound unless and until adjusted by regulation. Under CERCLA Section 103(a), the person in charge of a vessel or
facility from which a hazardous substance has been released in a quantity that is equal to or exceeds its RQ immediately
shall notify the NRC of the release as soon as that person has knowledge thereof. The toll-free number of the NRC is 1-800-424-8802;
in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the number is (202) 426-2675. In addition to this reporting requirement
under CERCLA, Section 304 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) requires owners
or operators of certain facilities to report the release of a CERCLA hazardous substance to State and local authorities.
Immediately after the release of a RQ or more, EPCRA Section 304 notification must be given to the community emergency
coordinator of the local emergency planning committee for each area likely to be affected by the release, and to the
State emergency response commission of any State likely to be affected by the release. 

If this proposal is promulgated as a final rule, releases equal to or greater than the one-pound statutory RQ will be
subject to the requirements described above, unless and until the Agency adjusts the RQs for these substances in a
future rulemaking. 



VIII. Economic Impact Analysis 



This section of the preamble summarizes the costs and benefits of the dye and pigment hazardous waste listings. Based
upon the EIA, the Agency estimates that the listing of the five dye and pigment production wastes discussed above may
result in nationwide, pre-tax, annualized costs of approximately $18.1 million for compliance in commercial Subtitle
C landfills. The possible future costs of this listing including compliance with land disposal restrictions (LDRs)
range from $20.3 to $70.7 million per year. The $70.7 million represents off-site incineration of non-wastewaters,
while the $20.3 million assumes facilities with large non-wastewater waste volumes will construct on-site incinerators.
A complete discussion of the EIA is available in the regulatory docket entitled ``Costs and Economic Impact Analysis
of Listing Hazardous Wastes from the Organic Dye and Pigment Industries,'' November 28, 1994.

A. Compliance Costs for Listings 



The remainder of this section briefly describes (1) the universe of dye and pigment production facilities and volumes
of the seven dye and pigment production wastes proposed to be listed, (2) the methodology for determining incremental
cost and economic impacts to regulated entities, (3) the potential remedial action costs, and (4) economic impacts.
Results of the analysis are summarized in Table VIII-1.



1. Universe of Dye and Pigment Production Facilities and Waste Volumes 



In order to estimate costs for the EIA, it first was necessary to estimate the total annual generation of dye and pigment
production wastes affected by this action. As described in Section II.B of this preamble, the portion of the dye and
pigment industry producing products affected by this listing is composed of 33 manufacturers operating 49 facilities
producing dyes and pigments. In 1992, U.S. sales of all organic dyes and pigments totalled 403 million lbs., with a
value of $1,691 million. Total annual product volumes and waste quantities generated by these affected facilities
were derived from a 1991 survey of the dye and pigment production industries. The production volume and, hence, waste
volume for dyes and pigments varies year to year depending on which colors are popular. A season in which dark colors
are in fashion will produce higher volumes of waste; it is not known which colors were predominant in the study year.




2. Method for Determining Cost and Economic Impacts 



This section details EPA's approach for estimating the incremental compliance cost and the economic impacts attributable
to the listing of dye and pigment production wastes. Because the dye and pigment production industries are moderately
small (33 manufacturers currently operating 49 facilities), EPA was able to collect facility-specific information
and estimate incremental costs at the wastestream level. For ten of the 49 facilities, however, some of the waste generation
data were missing. In these cases, waste generation amounts were estimated. The information used in this analysis
was collected in 1992 through RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaires, engineering site visits, and sampling and analysis
of wastestreams. 



Approach to the Cost Analysis 



EPA's approach to the cost analysis for this rule was to compare the cost of current management practices, as reported
in the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire by dye and pigment production facilities, with the projected cost of management
to comply with the RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste program. An additional analysis included the future cost to the
industry of complying with land disposal restrictions. This difference in cost, when annualized,
 represents the incremental annual compliance costs attributable to the rule. 





Baseline or Current Management Scenario 



Relying on survey responses and engineering site visits, EPA was able to determine the current (

i.e.,

 1991) management practices for the handling and disposal of dye and pigment production wastes. Current management
practices varied among facilities and wastestreams, and included such practices as on-site monofilling, off-site
incineration, on-site destruction in boilers, and off-site landfilling in municipal, industrial or Subtitle C
landfills. These current management practices at each facility represent the baseline scenario of the analysis.


As part of the survey, EPA asked each facility to identify current costs for the management of dye and pigment production
wastes. For this analysis, EPA relied on the industry's own waste-specific estimates concerning the cost of current
management. EPA realizes that future events, such as waste minimization efforts, may change waste generation volumes
and, thus, future waste management costs. 



Post-Regulatory Management Scenarios 



In estimating the cost of compliance with the listing of dye and pigment production wastes as RCRA hazardous wastes,
EPA assessed the potential waste management on the part of industry to the listing and also assessed the management
cost in response to LDRs. 

Initial waste management, excluding land disposal restrictions, assumes all non-wastewaters will be sent to off-site
Subtitle C landfills. Wastewaters are assumed to be handled in tanks, at an estimated cost of $18.1 million/yr. It
is important to note that 81 to 95 percent of the total, annual, incremental compliance costs result from listing the
non-wastewaters. The non-wastewaters comprise less than one percent of the quantity of the affected wastes. 

There were two possible management strategies examined for the dye and pigment industries following the promulgation
of LDRs. The first strategy, the higher-cost response, is waste management, including land disposal restrictions,
with all non-wastewaters being sent to off-site incinerators. Wastewaters are assumed to be handled in newly-constructed
treatment impoundments, which makes this strategy an upper-bound estimate ($70.7 million/yr) because the other
option for wastewaters, handling in tanks, is marginally less expensive.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941222-1-00077 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The second strategy for waste management assumes facilities 
with high waste volumes will construct on-site incinerators in 
which to treat their non-wastewaters, with the remaining 
facilities sending their wastes to off-site incinerators ($20.3 
million/yr). Wastewaters are assumed to be handled in newly 
constructed treatment impoundments. 



3. Potential Remedial Action Costs 



In addition to dye and pigment production wastes, this 
listing can affect the management of soils, ground water, and 
other remedial materials. The Agency's ``contained in'' policy 
defines certain remediation wastes ``containing'' a listed 
hazardous waste as a RCRA hazardous waste. It is possible that 
areas of past dye and pigment waste management, spills, or 
disposal, which met the proposed listing description at the time 
they were placed on the land, still may have contaminant 
concentrations which exceed ``contained in'' levels. A person who 
disturbs such material can become a generator of RCRA hazardous 
waste. The likelihood of this imposing an additional burden is 
moderate because at least 9 of the 49 dye and pigment production 
facilities already are permitted TSDFs. Releases from all solid 
waste management units at these TSDFs, including those that in 
the future may be found to contain a waste meeting the dye and 
pigment listing descriptions, already are covered by facility-wide clean-up rules under 40 CFR 264.101. This issue
will be 
more likely to arise from historical off-site management at 
facilities that were not TSDFs. The pre-tax, incremental cost of 
corrective action liabilities has been estimated at less than 
$8.8 million.

4. Economic Impacts 



The following economic impacts potentially are 

overestimated

 
as a result of inconsistencies in the reporting in the RCRA 
Section 3007 Questionnaire responses. Some facilities were found 
to have reported production quantities on a pure product basis 
while reporting the average selling price per pound on a dilute 
product basis. This results in an underestimation of revenues, 
as a result of reduced production volumes, and an overestimation 
of economic impacts. In addition, some of the volume of several 
of the wastestreams is for co-managed wastes. The values of 
production for the co-generated products were not available and, 
thus, further underestimated revenues which resulted in 
overestimated economic impacts. Economic impacts were evaluated 
based on incremental, annualized compliance costs discounted at 
an after-tax rate of 7 percent over a 20-year period. Of the 49 
facilities 9 facilities may incur potential ``significant economic 
impacts'' (

i.e.

, bear compliance costs that would require product 
cost increases of at least 5 percent) with one of these 
facilities facing product-line discontinuation. Sixteen of the 
49 facilities are estimated to incur potential significant 
impacts assuming possible future costs for the high-cost LDR 
alternative. Economic ratios indicate potential closure or 
product-line discontinuation for 4 of the 16 significantly 
affected facilities. Under the low-cost LDR alternative, 15 of 
the 49 facilities are estimated to incur potential significant 
economic impacts. Two of the 15 significantly affected 
facilities are estimated to incur closure or product-line 
discontinuation. 



5. Benefits of Listings 



One objective of a population analysis is to estimate the 
number of cancer cases that could be avoided as a result of the 
implementation of the proposed rule. People drinking 
contaminated water from residential wells located near the source 
of contamination, people eating home-grown vegetables 
contaminated by blowing dust or vapors, and people breathing air 
contaminated by a disposal unit are the potentially exposed 
population for this rule. The Agency did not estimate the 
population risks from current practices or the incremental risk 
reduction from future actions as a result of the proposed 
regulation; however, preliminary analysis suggests that the 
incremental risk in terms of cancer cases avoided is expected to 
be near zero. 

One benefit associated with this rulemaking is to place 
wastestreams the Agency has determined could pose a risk to human 
health and the environment into the hazardous waste management 
system. When wastestreams are placed in this system, the risk 
associated with their disposal is minimized by the requirements 
of this system. 

The Agency, however, has historical information that shows 
damage to ground water and other sensitive environments has 
occurred during the management of wastes from the dye and pigment 
manufacturing operations. At ten dye and pigment facilities, the 
quality of ground water has been adversely affected by waste 
management activities, typically unlined waste trenches, aeration 
basins, and impoundments. One dye company had to purchase the 
deeds to three nearby residences and a gas station because VOC-contaminated ground water originating from the plant
had 
contaminated surrounding drinking water wells. At another dye 
facility, a contaminated ground-water plume migrated under 
residential houses bordering the site. The residential wells, 
used for swimming pools and irrigation systems in the 
neighborhood, were condemned because of chemical contamination. 
Ground water was contaminated from land treatment of dye 
wastewater being sprayed onto a field, and passing through a 
layer of clay. Soil contamination near drum storage pads or drum 
wash areas has been documented at 7 dye facilities. As a result, 
the leachate from these soils possibly contributed to the ground- 
water contamination associated with many of the sites. 
Concentrations of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds 
have been found in soils surrounding an on-site landfill at a dye 
facility. Finally, dye and pigment facilities are found on the 
Superfund National Priority List; further evidence that 
mismanagement of dye and pigment wastes have the potential to 
yield threats of concern to human health. In summary, although 
difficult to quantify precisely, a benefit of today's proposal is 
the prevention of additional or similar incidents occurring from 
similar management practices of dye and pigment wastes that 
potentially could degrade the quality of ground water or other 
sensitive natural resources. 

In addition to the reduction of human health risk associated 
with the mismanagement of dye and pigment wastes proposed for 
listing in this rulemaking, there are a number of other benefits 
that are even more difficult to quantify. 

The Subtitle C management framework for generators and 
permitted treatment storage and disposal facilities establishes 
standards for hazardous waste handling, management, and 
remediation that: Reduce ecological risks, reduce natural 
resource damage, reduce the likelihood and severity of accidents, 
improve worker safety, promote facility-wide remedial programs, 
insure that adequate financial assurance is established to handle 
protective closure of waste management units, increase public 
participation, improve information availability on waste quantity 
and movement, ensure minimum uniform national standards, and 
create incentives for pollution prevention. 



Ecological and Natural Resource Damage Reduction 



The risk assessment for this listing has focused on the 
human health risks associated with plausible management of dye 
and pigment wastes. An additional concern, given the proximity 
of several facilities to surface waters and their associated 
wetland systems, is the potential for ecological damages to biota 
inhabiting surface waters and w
