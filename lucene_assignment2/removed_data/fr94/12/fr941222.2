Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Taiwan; Preliminary Results of Administrative Review 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a request from the U.S. Butt-Weld Fittings Committee, petitioner in this proceeding, the Department
of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on carbon steel
butt-weld pipe fittings from Taiwan. The review covers four manufacturers/exporters of the subject merchandise
to the United States for the period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993. 


We have preliminarily determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary
results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping
duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and FMV. 
Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


On December 17, 1986, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 45152) the antidumping duty order on carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Taiwan. On November 26, 1993,
the Department published (58 FR 62327) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' of the antidumping
duty order for the period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993. We received a timely request from the petitioner,
the U.S. Butt-Weld Fittings Committee, to review C.M. Pipe Fitting Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (CM), Rigid Industries
Co., Ltd. (Rigid), Chup Hsin Enterprises (Chup Hsin), and Gei Bey Corporation (Gei Bey). The period of review (POR)
covers December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, and the administrative review was initiated on January 18, 1994
(59 FR 2593). The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(the Act). 


Scope of the Review 


Imports covered by this review are shipments of carbon steel butt-weld type pipe fittings, other than couplings,
under 14 inches in inside diameter, whether finished or unfinished, that have been formed in the shape of elbows, tees,
reducers, and caps, and if forged, have been advanced after forging. These advancements may include one or more of
the following: coining, heat treatment, shot blasting, grinding, die stamping, or painting. 
Carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings are currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number
7307.93.3000. The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and for U.S. Customs purposes. The written description
remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. 


Best Information Available 


In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have preliminarily determined that the use of best information otherwise
available (BIA) is appropriate for certain firms. The Department's regulations provide that we may take into account
whether a party refuses to provide information (19 CFR 353.37(b)). For purposes of these reviews, we have used the
most adverse BIA_generally, the highest rate for any company for this same class or kind of merchandise from this or
any prior segment of the proceeding_whenever a company refused to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly
impeded the proceeding. When a company substantially cooperated with our requests for information, but failed to
provide all the information requested in a timely manner or in the form requested, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the
highest rate (including the ``all others'' rate) ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise
from the same country from either the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation or a prior administrative review;
or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from the same
country. See 

Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany,
et. al.; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 

56 FR 31692, 31704 (July 11, 1991); see also 

Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States 

996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
Because Chup Hsin and Gei Bey failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we have used the highest rate ever
found in this proceeding to establish their margins. This rate is 87.30 percent, which was also used for these two firms
in the LTFV investigation when they failed to respond in that stage of the proceeding.

United States Price 


 

In calculating USP, the Department treated respondents' sales as purchase price (PP) transactions, as defined in
section 772 of the Act, because the merchandise was sold to unrelated U.S. purchasers prior to importation. 


 PP was based on c.i.f. U.S. port prices to unrelated purchasers in, or for exportation to, the United States. We made
deductions from PP, as appropriate, for domestic inland freight, brokerage and handling charges, assorted port
and trade development taxes in Taiwan, ocean freight, marine insurance, imputed credit expenses, assorted bank
and interest charges, and commissions. 


 We adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice as outlined in 

Silicomanganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,

 59 FR 31204 (June 17, 1994). 


 No other adjustments were claimed or allowed. 


 

Foreign Market Value 


 

In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings in the home market
to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of carbon steel butt-weld
pipe fittings to the volume of third country sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. CM and Rigid had
viable home markets with respect to sales of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings. 


 Because 20 percent of Rigid's foreign market sales were determined to have been made below the cost of production (COP)
during the last administrative review (56 FR 20187, 20188), we concluded that reasonable grounds existed to believe
or suspect that home market sales during the POR were made at prices below COP. Therefore, pursuant to section 773(b)
of the Act, the Department initiated a COP investigation of Rigid for purposes of this administrative review. See


Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from Eight Countries; Preliminary
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews,

 59 FR 9463, 9467 (February 28, 1994). Furthermore, based on an allegation by petitioner, we also determined that reasonable
grounds existed to believe or suspect that sales below cost of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings had been made by
CM. Thus, we initiated a COP investigation with respect to CM. 


 We performed a model-specific COP test, in which we examined whether each home market sale was priced below the merchandise's
COP. The Department defines the COP as the sum of direct material, direct labor, variable and fixed factory overhead,
general expenses, and packing. For each model, we compared this sum to the reported home market unit price, net of price
adjustments and movement expenses. In accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we also examined whether the home
market sales of each model were made at prices below their COP in substantial quantities over an extended period of
time, and whether such sales were made at prices which would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period
of time in the normal course of trade. 


 For each model where less than 10 percent, by quantity, of the home market sales during the POR were made at prices below
the COP, we included all sales of that model in the computation of FMV. For each model where 10 percent or more, but not
more than 90 percent, of the home market sales during the POR were priced below the merchandise's COP, we excluded from
the calculation of FMV those home market sales which were priced below the merchandise's COP, provided that these
below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time. For each model where 90 percent or more of the home market
sales during the POR were priced below the COP, we disregarded all sales of that model from our calculation of FMV and
used the constructed value (CV) of those models as described below. See 

Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from Eight Countries; Preliminary
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews,

 59 FR 9463, 9467 (February 28, 1994). 


 In order to determine if sales below cost had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months
in which below-cost sales occurred for each model to the number of months during the POR in which each model was sold.
If a model was sold in fewer than three months, we did not exclude the below-cost sales unless there were below-cost
sales in each month of sale. If a model was sold in three or more months, we did not exclude the below-cost sales unless
there were below-cost sales in at least three months during the POR. See 

Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from Nine Countries; Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews,

 58 FR 39729, 39751 (July 26, 1993). Based on this test, we found it necessary to disregard certain home market sales
made by CM and Rigid. 


 We used CV as FMV for those U.S. sales for which there were insufficient sales of the comparison home-market model at
or above the COP. We calculated CV, in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act, as the sum of the cost of manufacturing
of the product sold in the United States, home market selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, home
market profit, and U.S. packing. For home market SG&A expenses, we used the larger of the actual SG&A expenses
reported by the respondents or 10 percent of the COM, the statutory minimum for foreign SG&A expenses. For home
market profit, we used the larger of the actual profit reported by the respondents or the statutory minimum of eight
percent of the sum of COM and SG&A expenses. 


 For those models that had sufficient above-cost sales, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers
in the home market. In calculating FMV, we made adjustments, where appropriate, for inland freight and imputed credit
expenses. We adjusted for the Taiwan consumption tax in accordance with our decision in 

Silicomanganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,

 59 FR 31204 (June 17, 1994). We deducted home market packing costs from the home market price and added U.S. packing
costs to the FMV. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56, we also made, where applicable, adjustments for differences in the physical
characteristics of merchandise. Furthermore, where commissions were paid on U.S. sales and not paid on home market
sales, we allowed an offset to FMV amounting to the lesser of the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses
or the U.S. commissions, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b) of the regulations. 


 No other adjustments were claimed or allowed. 


 

Preliminary Results of Review 


 

As a result of this review, we preliminary determine that the following margins exist for the period December 1, 1992,
through November 30, 1993:

Upon completion of the final results of this review, the Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall
assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from
the percentages stated above. Upon completion of the review the Department will issue appraisement instructions
with respect to each exporter directly to the U.S. Customs Service. 


 Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of carbon steel butt-weld pipe
fittings entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results
of this administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed
companies will be those rates established in the final results of this review; 
(2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be
the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review,
but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established in this review for the manufacturer of the
merchandise; and (4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review conducted
by the Department, the cash deposit rates will be 49.46%, the all other rate established in the LTFV investigation
(51 FR 37772). 


 These deposit requirements will remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative
review. 


 Interested parties may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice, and may request
a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held as early as convenient for
the parties but not later than 44 days after the date of publication or the first work day thereafter. Case briefs or
other written comments from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication
of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttal comments, limited to issues in the case briefs, may be filed not later
than 37 days after the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review,
including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments. 


 This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 


 This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

NIST Docket No. 91-020CIP2


Title: Electric Test Structure and Method for Measuring the Relative Locations of Conducting Features on an Insulating
Substrate
Description: NIST researchers have invented a new electrical test structure to provide measurements of the separations
of conducting features on an insulating substrate with uncertainties typically below 10 nm. Measurement dynamic
repeatability is nominally less than 1 nm. Absolute accuracy has been determined by comparing measurements of the
same feature separations with those made by the NIST line-scale interferometer which has traceability to absolute
length standards.


NIST Docket No. 92-017


Title: Electroforming of Metallic Glasses for Dental Applications
Description: A method of electroforming metallic glasses to produce dental prostheses and the resulting prostheses.
The method uses a cobalt-phosphorus metallic glass alloy that produces prostheses with superior strength and high
corrosion resistance.


NIST Docket No. 93-040


Title: Underwater Work Platform Support System
Description: NIST researchers have developed a system to stabilize an underwater work platform in six degrees of
freedom. Suspended by cables beneath a surface vessel, the platform is stabilized through the use of winches and motion
sensors even when the surface vessel is disturbed by waves.


NIST Docket No. 93-057


Title: Prevention of Contact Tube Melting In Arc Welding
Description: NIST engineers have developed a technique to detect and prevent the onset of contact tube melting in
gas metal arc and flux cored arc welding. Anticipating the problem enables interruption of the welding power supply
and prevention of contact tube melting.


NIST Docket No. 93-012


Title: Accumulator Distillation Insert for Zeotropic Refrigerant Mixtures
Description: NIST researchers have developed an accumulator distillation insert that improves the efficiency
of heat pumps. The insert is cost-effective because it only requires minor modifications to an existing system, it
does not change the basic refrigeration cycle, and it adds no additional moving parts or valves.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Issuance of Modification 4 to Scientific Research and Enhancement Permit 747 (P45H) and Notice of Receipt of an Application
for a Scientific Research Permit (P578). 


 


On September 12, 1994, an application was filed by the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife (FWS) for a modification
to their scientific research and enhancement Permit 747 (P45H). Permit 747 allows FWS to take threatened Sacramento
River winter-run chinook salmon (

Oncorhynchus

 

tshawytscha

) as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-543) and the NMFS regulations governing
listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-22). 
FWS requested an expansion of their research sampling area to include the lower reaches of the creeks and tributaries
of the Sacramento River in Butte, Glenn, and Tehama Counties in CA. The expanded sampling will occur in the tributaries
within 5 miles of their confluence with the mainstem Sacramento River. In addition, FWS requested authorization
to allow Dr. Paul E. Maslin, Department of Biological Sciences, California State University at Chico and his graduate
students to carry out this expanded sampling and to participate in the part of the research involving the annual collection
and sacrifice of up to 450 adipose fin-clipped and coded-wire tagged juvenile, listed, Sacramento River winter-run
chinook salmon released from the FWS's Coleman National Fish Hatchery. 
Notice is hereby given that on December 6, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification
4 to Permit 747 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. This modification will be in
effect for the duration of the permit, which expires on December 31, 1995. 
Issuance of this permit, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such permit: (1) Was applied for in good faith;
(2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this permit; (3) is consistent
with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance with and is
subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. 
Notice is hereby given that the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has applied in due form to take listed
species as authorized by the ESA and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits. 
DWR (P578) requests authorization to take juvenile and adult, threatened, Sacramento River winter-run chinook
salmon (

Oncorhynchus

 

tshawytscha

) for scientific research purposes while conducting an acoustic barrier applied research project at the confluence
of Georgiana Slough with the Sacramento River. The purpose of the proposed project is to determine the effectiveness
of an underwater acoustic barrier in diverting migrating juvenile chinook salmon away from Georgiana Slough under
various hydraulic and hydrologic conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated substantially higher mortality
rates for downstream migrating juvenile chinook salmon which pass from the Sacramento River into Georgiana Slough
when compared with salmon which continue their migration downstream within the Sacramento River channel. The proposed
study involves Kodiak trawling within the Sacramento River and Georgiana Slough between February and June 1995 to
determine the guidance efficiency of the barrier. 
Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on this application should be submitted to the Chief, Endangered
Species Division, Office of Protected Resources, F/PR8, NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3226,
within 30 days of the publication of this notice. Those individuals requesting a hearing should set out the specific
reasons why a hearing on this particular application would be appropriate. The holding of such hearing is at the discretion
of the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA. All statements and opinions contained in this application summary
are those of the Applicant and do not necessarily reflect the views of NMFS. 
Documents submitted in connection with the above actions are available for review by interested persons in the following
offices by appointment: 
Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, NOAA, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3226 (301-713-1401);

<DOCTITLE>Partial Record of Decision (PROD) for the Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental Impact Statement for Carswell Air
Force Base (AFB), Texas</DOCTITLE>


On November 21, 1994, the Air Force issued a PROD for the disposal of a portion of Carswell Air Force Base (AFB), Texas.
The decisions included in this PROD have been made in consideration of the Carswell AFB Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS), which was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on February 18, 1994, and other
relevant considerations.
Carswell AFB was officially closed on September 30, 1993, pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act
(DBCRA) of 1990, (Public Law 101-510) and the recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base
Realignment and Closure. This PROD documents the Carswell AFB disposal decisions.
The Air Force has decided to dispose of the approximately 1946 acres fee and 69.99 acres leased portion of the base in
the following manner: Parcel A (approximately 95.03 acres) will be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for
the development of a Federal Medical Center Complex, Parcel B (20 houses on approximately 6.68 acres) will be assigned
to Health and Human Services for a Public Benefit Conveyance to ARI for a rehabilitation center, Parcel C (one house
on approximately .23 acres) will be assigned to the Department of Education for a Public Benefit Conveyance to Westworth
Village for use as a public library, Parcel D (approximately 1,840 acres fee and 69.99 acres leased), will be retained
and realigned by the DoD as mandated by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.
The uses proposed for the property by prospective recipients of property under the ROD are included in the proposed
action in the FEIS and are consistent with the community's draft redevelopment plan for the base. Carswell Redevelopment
Authority prepared the plan, with the assistance of the broader community.
By this decision, the Air Force adopts certain mitigation measures, as described in this PROD, to protect public health
and the environment. In response to existing or forecasted environmental impacts to or in the area of Carswell AFB,
subsequent property owners should consider implementation of the more specific mitigation measures associated
with reuses they may undertake, as set forth in Chapter 4 of the Final Environmental Impact Statement.
Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. Charles R. Hatch, Program Manager, Southwest Division.
Correspondence should be sent to AFBCA/SW, 1700 N. Moore Street, suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209-2809.

<DOCTITLE>Energy Research Financial Assistance Program Notice 95-11; Advanced Battery Technology Research and Development
</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice inviting grant applications. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES) of the Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy, hereby
announces its interest in receiving grant applications to support a continuing program for advanced 
battery technology research and development focused on batteries for the 
consumer market. 


Batteries and battery-like devices are a mainstay of contemporary electronic, information, and transportation
industries. The performance of batteries is often the limiting factor that hinders the development of improved portable
devices such as cellular telephones, laptop computers, hand held tools, and other consumer products. Stringent
environmental requirements impose restrictions on the use of battery materials and components deemed to be harmful
not only to the environment but also to human well being. 
The objective of this effort is to develop new generic battery technology for a wide range of non-automotive uses,
with particular emphasis on improvements in battery size, weight, life, and recharge cycles. The interest is in novel
research and technology development, and not in research leading to incremental improvements in existing devices.
For the purpose of this notice, batteries for transportation and fuel cells are excluded from consideration. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department's intention for this program is to use a limited amount of money to stimulate as much research and development
as possible on new battery technologies. Accordingly, applicants are encouraged to collaborate with industry and
to incorporate cost sharing and consortia wherever feasible. The extent of collaboration and cost sharing may be
considered when DOE selects applicants for support under this program. 


Appropriate topics for research are: Electrode research including 
investigations of graphitized and composite electrodes for Li

+

 cells, metal 
hydrides, bifunctional air electrodes, fundamental studies of composite 
electrode structures, the failure and degradation of active electrode 
materials, and thin-film electrodes, electrolytes, and interfaces. 
Consideration will also be given to secondary aqueous zinc cells and the 
problems of overcharge/overdischarge, power capability, and cyclability of 
anodes in lithium cells, oxidative degradation of electrolytes by high voltage 
cathodes, and highly conductive thin-film ceramic electrodes. Appropriate 
topics in the area of characterization and methodologies include problems of 
electrode morphology, zinc corrosion, separator/electrolyte stability and 
stable microelectrodes. Also of interest are investigations in computational 
chemistry, modeling, and simulations, including property predictions, 
phenomenological studies of reactions and interactions at critical interfaces, 
film formation, phase change effects on electrodes and characterization of 
crystalline and amorphous materials. Other topics of interest include novel 
battery separators and the transport properties of electrode and electrolyte 
materials and surface films. A detailed listing of research needs for battery 
technology appears in the report of a ``Workshop on Advanced Battery Technology Research and Development''. Copies
are available on request from the U.S. Department of Energy, Chemical Sciences Division, Office of Energy Research,
ER-14, Washington, D.C. 20585. Telephone requests may be made by calling (301) 903-5804. 
It is anticipated that $600,000 will be available for grant awards during 
FY 1995, contingent upon availability of appropriated funds. The number of 
awards and the range of funding will depend on the number of applications 
received and selected for award. Information about the development and 
submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, evaluation, selection 
process, and other policies and procedures may be found in the Application 
Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and 10 
CFR Part 605. The application guide is available from the U.S. Department of 
Energy, Chemical Sciences Division, Office of Energy Research, ER-14, 
Washington, D.C. 20585. Telephone requests may be made by calling 
(301) 903-5804. 
The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number for this program is 81.049, and the solicitation control number
is ERFAP 10 CFR part 605.

to a September 30, 1981Remedial Order issued to Ed's Exxon, Case No. LEF-0078, and an April 27, 1982 Remedial
Order issued to Ron's Shell, Case No. LEF-0084. The OHA has tentatively determined that the funds obtained from
the above firms, plus accrued interest, will be distributed to customers who purchased gasoline from them during
the following periods: August 1, 1979 through October 31, 1979 in the Ed's Exxon proceeding and August 1, 1979 through
November 13, 1981 in the Ron's Shell proceeding.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 10 C.F.R. 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order
set out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to
distribute to eligible claimants $3,657.84, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE pursuant to September 30,
1981 and April 27, 1982 Remedial Orders. In the Remedial Orders, the DOE found that, during periods beginning August
1, 1979, the firms each had sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price, in violation
of Federal petroleum price regulations. 


The OHA has tentatively determined to distribute the funds obtained from the firms in two stages. In the first stage,
we will accept claims from identifiable purchasers of gasoline from the firms who may have been injured by overcharges.
The specific requirements which an applicant must meet in order to receive a refund are set out in Section III of the
Proposed Decision. Claimants who meet these specific requirements will be eligible to receive refunds based on the
number of gallons of gasoline which they purchased from Ed's Exxon or Ron's Shell. 
If any funds remain after valid claims are paid in the first stage, they may be used for indirect restitution in accordance
with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501-07.
Applications for Refund should not be filed at this time. Appropriate public notice will be provided prior to the acceptance
of claims. Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting
parties are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding
will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E-234, 1000 Independence
Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20585.

Proposed Decision and Order 
of the Department of Energy 
 

Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 
 
 

Names of Firms: Ed's Exxon; Ron's Shell 
 Date of Filing: July 20, 1993 
 Case Numbers: LEF-0078; LEF-0084



 
On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute
the funds received pursuant to Remedial Orders issued by the DOE to Ed's Exxon of Cotati, California, and Ron's Shell
of Danville, California (hereinafter jointly referred to as the remedial order firms). In accordance with the provisions
of the procedural regulations at 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requests in its Petition that the
OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of regulatory violations set forth
in the Remedial Order. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds. 

 

I. Background 
 

Each of the remedial order firms was a retailer of motor gasoline during the periods relevant to this proceeding. The
ERA issued Proposed Remedial Orders (PROs) to each of the firms.

1

 The PROs alleged that, during separate periods beginning on August 1, 1979, the remedial order firms had: charged
more than the maximum lawful selling price for one or more grades of gasoline in violation of 10 C.F.R. 212.93; failed
to post and maintain the maximum lawful selling price or a proper certification in violation of 10 C.F.R. 212.129;
failed to keep and maintain books and records to support the lawfulness of the price for gasoline on the audit date in
violation of 10 C.F.R. 210.92 and 212.93; and/or engaged in unlawful or discriminatory business practices in violation
of 10 C.F.R. 210.62. 





After considering and dismissing the firms' objections to the PROs, the DOE issued final Remedial Orders. 

Ed's Exxon,

 8 DOE  83,035 (1981); 

Alameda Chevron Service, et al.,

 9 DOE  83,027 (1982).

2

 Each of the firms has since remitted a specified amount in compliance with the Remedial Orders, to which interest has
since accrued. These funds are being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department of the
Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution. 





II. Jurisdiction and Authority 
 

The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing
a plan of distribution of funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart
V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion
procedures to distribute refunds, 

see Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986,

 15 U.S.C. 4501 et seq., 

Office of Enforcement,

 9 DOE  82,508 (1981), and 

Office of Enforcement,

 8 DOE  82,597 (1981) (

Vickers

). 
 We have considered the ERA's petition that we implement Subpart V proceedings with respect to the above remedial order
funds and have determined that such proceedings are appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the
OHA's tentative plan to distribute these funds. Before taking the actions proposed in this Decision, we intend to
publicize our proposal and solicit comments from interested parties. Comments regarding the tentative distribution
processes set forth in this Proposed Decision and Order should be filed with the OHA within 30 days of its publication
in the 

Federal Register

. 
 

III. Proposed Refund Procedures 
 

We propose to implement a two-stage refund procedure for distribution of the remedial order funds, by which purchasers
of gasoline from the remedial order firms during the period covered by the Remedial Orders may submit Applications
for Refund in the initial stage. From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicants
generally will be limited to ultimate consumers (``end-users''). Therefore, we do not anticipate that it will be
necessary to employ the injury presumptions that we have used in past proceedings in evaluating applications submitted
by refiners, resellers, and retailers.

3

 





A. 

First Stage Refund Procedures.

 
In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submit a schedule of its monthly purchases of gasoline
from the remedial order firm during the period covered by the Remedial Order. Our experience indicates that the use
of certain presumptions permits claimants to participate in the refund process without incurring inordinate expense
and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficient manner possible. See 

Marathon Petroleum Co.,

 14 DOE  85,269 (1986) (

Marathon

). 
 Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorized by the applicable Subpart V regulations at 10 C.F.R.  205.282(e).
Accordingly, we propose to adopt the presumptions set forth below. 
 1. Calculation of Refunds. 
First, we will adopt a presumption that the overcharges were dispersed equally in all of the remedial order firms'
sales of gasoline during the period covered by the Remedial Orders. In accordance with this presumption, refunds
will be made on a pro-rata or volumetric basis.

4

 In the absence of better information, a volumetric refund is appropriate because the DOE price regulations generally
required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on a firm-wide basis in determining its prices. 





Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's ``allocable share'' of a Remedial Order fund is equal to the number of
gallons purchased from the remedial order firm during the period covered by that Remedial Order times the per gallon
refund amount.

5

 We derived the per gallon refund figures by dividing the amount of each Remedial Order fund by the total volume of gasoline
which each remedial order firm sold during the period specified in that Remedial Order. An applicant that establishes
its eligibility for a refund will receive all or a portion of its allocable share plus a pro-rata share of the accrued
interest.

6

 






In addition to the volumetric presumption, we will adopt a presumption regarding injury for end-users. 

2. End-Users. In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we will adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate
consumer of gasoline purchased from one of the remedial order firms whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry
was injured by the overcharges resolved by the Remedial Order. See, 

e.g., Texas Oil and Gas Corp.,

 12 DOE  85,069 at 88,209 (1984) (

TOGCO

). Members of this group generally were not subject to price controls during the period covered by the Remedial Order,
and were not required to keep records which justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently,
analysis of the impact of the overcharges on the final prices of goods and services produced by members of this group
would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding. 

Id.

 End-users of gasoline purchased from the remedial order firms need only document their purchase volumes from the
firm during the period covered by the Remedial Order to make a sufficient showing that they were injured by the overcharges.


B. 

Refund Applications Filed by Representatives. 

We will adopt the standard OHA procedures relating to refund applications filed on behalf of applicants by ``representatives,''
including refund filing services, consulting firms, accountants, and attorneys. See, 

e.g., Starks Shell Service, 

23 DOE  85,017 (1993); 

Texaco Inc.,

 20 DOE  85,147 (1990); 

Shell Oil Co.,

 18 DOE  85,492 (1989). We will also require strict compliance with the filing requirements as specified in 10
C.F.R.  205.283, particularly the requirement that applications and the accompanying certification statement
be signed by the applicant. 

 The OHA reiterates its policy to scrutinize applications filed by filing services closely. Applications submitted
by a filing service should contain all of the information indicated in the final Decision and Order in this proceeding.

 D. 

Distribution of Funds Remaining After First Stage.

 
We propose that any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided be distributed in accordance with
the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501-07.
PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be
required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments
for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA, and
any funds in the Remedial Order funds that the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured
customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA. 

 

It Is Therefore Ordered 

That: 
 The payments remitted to the Department of Energy by Ed's Exxon and Ron's Shell pursuant to the Remedial Orders dated
September 30, 1981 and April 27, 1982 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of State Implementation Plans: List of Qualified Coke Oven Panel Members 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 15, 1994, the EPA proposed the list of experienced coke oven inspectors who will serve as panel members during
the certification of coke oven observers
. The purpose of proposing and promulgating the list is to set forth the list of experienced coke oven inspectors who
will serve as panel members during the certification of coke oven observers. This action also informed the public
that these people have demonstrated to the Agency that they satisfy the minimum experience requirements, established
in Method 303 of Appendix A of Part 63, and gave the public the opportunity to examine the panel members' qualifications
and to comment. Additional panel members may be added in the future in accordance with implementation needs. Any additions
of certified and qualified inspectors to the panel will be made without promulgation, which was necessary only to
establish this initial panel. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 27, 1993, the EPA promulgated the coke oven National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants,
which limits the number of visible leaks from coke oven doors, topside ports, and offtake systems, and the amount of
time of visible emissions from the charging operation. Also promulgated at that time was Method 303 (40 CFR, part 63,
appendix A), which sets forth the procedures an observer shall follow to determine compliance with the coke oven standards.
In order to implement the coke oven rule, coke oven inspectors must be certified by an EPA recognized panel in accordance
with the procedures set forth in section 2 of Method 303. The Method 303 certification training for each trainee concludes
with a determination by a three-member panel as to the trainee's ability to conduct Method 303 satisfactorily. The
Agency developed a certification course for coke oven inspectors and, as part of this effort, the Agency selected
a group of experienced individuals to act as panel members. With today's action, the Agency finalizes an initial list
of experienced coke oven inspectors who will serve as panel members during the certification of coke oven observers.
Additional panel members may be added in the future in accordance with implementation needs. Any additions of certified
and qualified inspectors to the panel will be made without promulgation, which was only necessary to establish this
initial panel. 



Summary of Significant Comments and Associated Changes 



One verbal comment was received from EPA Region V. The commenter stated that one of the panel members, Mr. Basim Dihu
of EPA, had the experience to be a panel member for all of the emission points covered in the coke oven NESHAP, i.e., doors,
lids, offtakes, and charging. The proposal indicated that Mr. Dihu was qualified to be a panel member only for door
observations. 

The commenter is correct. Mr. Dihu's qualifications meet the Agency's criteria. The restrictions in the proposed
list have been removed in the final list, and Mr. Dihu is now considered by the Agency to be a qualified panel member and
able to act as such in the Method 303 certification course. 



I. Administrative Requirements 



A. Executive Order 12291 



Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major'' and therefore subject to the requirement
of a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). 

This action does not require any revision to existing State implementation plans (SIP's) or changes to any SIP regulation.
This action is not a major rule because it will neither have an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, nor will
it result in an increase in costs or prices to industry. There will be no adverse impact on the ability of U.S.-based
enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Because this action is not
a major regulation, no RIA is being conducted. 



B. Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 

(1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 

(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) materially alter the budget impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 

(4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 

OMB had exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements for the Coke Oven
Battery National Emission Standards under the provisions of the 

Paperwork Reduction Act

, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

. and has assigned OMB control number 2060-0253. This proposed action does not add any additional requirements
to those already approved. 



D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the publication
of this list does not significantly change the status quo for such entities. This regulation therefore does not require
an RFA. 



List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 63 



Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Coke oven emissions, Hazardous substances, Reporting and recordkeeping
requirements.

ACTION:

 Notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Institutes of Health is seeking licensees and/or CRADA partners for the further development, evaluation,
and commercialization of novel esters of estradiol and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. The invention claimed
in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/122,853 entitled ``Orally Active Derivatives of 1,3,5(10)-estratriene''
(Kim, H.K., Blye, R.P., and Bialy, G.), filed August 17, 1993, is available for either exclusive or non-exclusive
licensing (in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 and 37 CFR Part 404) and/or further development under a CRADA for clinical
and research applications described below in Supplementary Information. 


To expedite the research, development, and commercialization of this new class of drugs, the National Institutes
of Health is seeking one or more license agreements and/or CRADAs with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies
in accordance with the regulations governing the transfer of Government-developed agents. Any proposal to use or
develop these drugs will be considered. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 One facet of oral contraceptive technology which has received little attention over the last three decades is the
development of new orally active estrogens with attractive pharmacologic profiles. These would include hormones
with fewer side effects than those associated with the currently available estrogens, ethynylestradiol and its
3-methyl ether (mestranol), notably nausea, vomiting, alterations in liver function, and histopathology and clotting
disorders. Some clinicians have suggested that the presence of the 17-ethynyl moiety, which protects the steroid
from rapid metabolism by the liver (so-called ``first-pass'' effect) and thus confers oral activity, is also responsible
for many of the side effects observed with these drugs. 


In an effort to develop nonethynylated estrogens, NICHD has synthesized several estradiol nitrate esters which
exhibit potent estrogenic activity in rats and rhesus monkeys following both oral, subcutaneous, and percutaneous
administration. Using an increase in the uterine weight of immature rats (rat uterotropic test) as an endpoint, two
of these esters were more than five times as potent as ethynylestradiol following oral administration. They also
induce estrogen withdrawal bleeding in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys following both oral and percutaneous administration.
They are very potent postcoital agents following oral administration to rats on days 0-4 of gestation. 
The superiority of these esters to ethynylestradiol or its methyl ether as the estrogenic component of oral contraceptive
tablets will depend upon clinical and histopathological findings from toxicity studies in animals and/or clinical
observations in Phase I and II human studies. The estradiol nitrate esters also have considerable potential clinical
utility as replacement estrogens in menopausal women. The most widely used therapeutic regimens involve oral administration
of ethynylestradiol, estradiol or conjugated estrogens (principally estrone sulfate) either continuously or
cyclically, with or without addition of a progestin, much of which depends on the presence or absence of the uterus.

Compounds of this series have been studied for estrogenic potency following oral, subcutaneous and topical administration
and pharmacokinetic data are available on several analogs utilizing radioimmunoassays developed by the Government.
Relative binding affinities to the rat and rabbit uterine estrogen receptor are currently being studied.

In an effort to expedite research, development, and commercialization of the novel estradiol esters, the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development seeks a CRADA partner(s) for joint exploration and possible commercialization.
Any CRADA proposed for these purposes will be considered. 
The CRADA aims will include the rapid publication of research results consistent with protection of proprietary
information and patentable inventions as well as the timely exploitation of commercial opportunities. The CRADA
partner will enjoy the benefits of first negotiation for licensing Government rights to any inventions arising under
the agreement and will advance funds payable upon signing the CRADA to help defray Government expenses for patenting
such inventions and other CRADA-related costs. 
The role of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development will be as follows: 
1. Provide the collaborator with all biological data on compositions of matter covered by the agreement. 
2. Provide samples of compositions of matter covered by the agreement. 
3. Provide chemical data on compositions of matter covered by the agreement including synthetic routes, analytical
methods employed, and purity. 
4. Provide conformational analysis of compositions of matter covered by the agreement where possible. 
5. Continue studies on the pharmacokinetics and biological activity of compositions of matter covered by the agreement.

6. Conduct studies to optimize formulations for administration of the compositions of matter covered by the agreement
by various routes in rodents and primates. 
7. Conduct Ames Test and other genetic toxicology on compositions of matter covered by the agreement scheduled for
clinical evaluation. 
8. Participate in meetings with the Food and Drug Administration for establishment of the drug safety studies required
for Phase I, II, and III clinical investigations of any of the compositions of matter covered by the agreement and provide
liaison with that Agency. 
The role of the collaborator will be as follows: 
1. Undertake studies to identify any unique properties of the compositions of matter covered by the agreement including
pharmacological differences from ethynylestradiol and mestranol (ethynylestradiol-3-methyl ether) which might
favor their use as the estrogenic component of combined oral contraceptives. 
2. Undertake a broad spectrum of estrogen receptor binding studies. 
3. Undertake acute, subacute, chronic, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicology studies necessary to proceed
with the orderly evaluation of selected compositions of matter covered by the agreement in human subjects. 
4. Undertake an orderly sequence of clinical investigations of selected compositions of matter covered by the agreement
for their safety and efficacy as estrogens for employment in combined oral contraceptives, postcoital contraceptives
and for therapeutic use in gynecic medicine. 
Selection criteria for choosing the CRADA partner(s) will include but are not limited to the following: 
1. The collaborator must present in their proposal a clear statement of their capabilities and experience with respect
to the tasks to be undertaken. This would include experience in drug development, regulatory affairs, and marketing.

2. The proposal must contain a clear and concise outline of the work to be undertaken, a schedule of significant events,
and outline of objectives to be accomplished in a timely manner, and such experimental details as will provide a basis
for evaluation of competing submissions. 
3. The proposal must contain the level of financial support the collaborator will supply for CRADA-related Government
activities. 
4. A willingness to cooperate with the NICHD in publication of research results consistent with the protection of
proprietary information and patentable inventions which may arise during the period of the agreement. 
5. Agreement to be bound by DHHS rules and regulations regarding the use of human subjects in clinical investigations,
patent rights, ethical treatment of animals, and randomized clinical trials. 
6. Agreement with provisions for equitable distribution of patent rights to any inventions developed under the CRADA(s).
Generally, the rights of ownership are retained by the organization which is the employer of the inventor, with an
irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to the Government (when a company employee(s) is the sole inventor)
or an option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to the company on terms that are appropriate (when
the Government employee(s) is the sole inventor).

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive license in the United States
to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 08/058,154, entitled ``Method for Evaluating
Chemotherapeutic Agents in Hollow Fibers 

In Vivo,

'' to Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., having a place of business in San Diego, California. The patent rights in
this application have been assigned to the United States of America. 


The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within 60 days from the date of this published
Notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
The present invention relates to a method of screening the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents 

in vivo

 using target cells grown in biocompatible, selectively permeable macrocapsules. Most conventional methods (i.e.,
subcutaneous tumor model, sub-renal tumor model, peritoneal model and the metastasis model) permit only one type
of tumor cell or cell line to be screened per experiment per animal, with the animal subsequently sacrificed for analysis.
The present method allows for placing samples of syngeneic or xenogeneic cells into laboratory animals using cells
or cell lines grown in selectively permeable hollow fibers or dialysis tubing. The invention provides a rapid and
reliable method to screen potential chemotherapeutic agents for therapeutic uses in cancer or other human diseases.
Additionally, the method allows a single experimental animal to carry implants in multiple sites allowing simultaneous
evaluation of a chemotherapeutic agent capacity to reach various physiologic compartments such as subcutaneous,
intraperitoneal or intra-organ regions. The advantages of this system over the classical antitumor animal models
include: 1) the requirement for a smaller amount of test agent to assess preliminary 

in vivo

 efficacy; 2) rapid turn-around time, 3) the ability to test potential activity against multiple tumor types simultaneously
in the same experimental animal; 4) a reduction in the number of experimental animals required for assessing efficacy,
5) the possibility of assessing multiple treatment schedules in a short time frame, 6) the ability to recover the entire
implant, 7) the lack of contamination of the implanted cells by host cell, and 8) the ability to screen a test agent against
target cells cultivated in various physiologic compartments in the same laboratory animal. 
The present invention can be used in transgenic animals to determine the effect of a transgenic or protein product
thereof on a target cell line. Further, re-cultivating and re-screening the cells after analysis makes its possible
to assess the regrowth potential of cells surviving treatment and then determine their susceptibility to a second
treatment with the same or alternate chemotherapeutic agent(s). 
The contemplated fields of use for licensing would be for 1) preclinical testing in animals of products for toxicity
and efficacy, and 2) diagnostic testing in animals of human tissue specimens for resistance and sensitivity to alternative
therapeutic regimes. Spectrum Medical Industries intends to make, use and sell products, falling within the scope
of the patent application for the research and clinical diagnostic markets.

Environmental Statements; Availability, etc.: Grass Creek Resource Area, WY



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management, Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Grass Creek Resource Management Plan
for public review and comment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Grass Creek Resource Management Plan (RMP) describes and
analyzes four alternative resource management plans, including the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM's) preferred
alternative, developed through public scoping and in consultation with local Governments. The planning area includes
portions of Big Horn, Hot Springs, Park, and Washakie counties in the Bighorn Basin of north central Wyoming. When
completed, the Grass Creek RMP will provide the management direction for future land and resource management actions
on approximately 968,000 acres of public land surface and approximately 1,171,000 acres of Federal mineral estate
administered by the BLM. 



The draft EIS focuses on resolving three key issues identified through public scoping and analysis of current BLM
management in the Grass Creek planning area. These issues are: 




1. Vegetation management 
2. Special management area designations 
3. Public land and resource accessibility and manageability 






The proposed designation of three Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACECs) is addressed in the draft EIS.
These are the Fifteenmile Creek Watershed proposed ACEC (274,300 acres), the Meeteetse Draw proposed ACEC (6,800
acres), and the Upper Owl Creek proposed ACEC (17,100 acres). 

Management of the Fifteenmile Creek Watershed proposed ACEC would emphasize a cooperative approach to improving
riparian and upland areas, and reducing the amount of sediment delivered to the Bighorn River. State and local Government,
private landowners, grazing permittees, and other interested parties would collaborate in managing the area. 

The Meeteetse Draw proposed ACEC would highlight the importance of Native American cultural values associated with
this area. The primary emphasis of BLM's management would be to improve public education, interpretation, scientific
research, and protection of Native American cultural values. Controlled management of this area would also allow
Native Americans to have access to these sites for ritual purposes and aid in preserving aspects of their heritage.


The Upper Owl Creek proposed ACEC would be managed to maintain important wildlife habitat, protect rare plants, maintain
scenic quality, enhance recreation, and reduce erosion and natural hazards associated with the area's landslide
potential. 

These proposed ACEC designations would highlight the three areas for management and funding, but would not increase
the level of restrictions on land uses above that which would otherwise be appropriate for management. The special
management designations also would not apply to State or private lands. 

In accordance with the provisions of 38 CFR Part 800, parties who are interested in and who wish to be involved in future
activity planning and implementation of management actions that may involve or affect the archaeological and historical
resources addressed in the proposed plan, are requested to identify themselves. Through contacting the Worland
District Office at the below address, you will be placed on a future contact list. 

The coal screening process (including application of the coal unsuitability criteria under 43 CFR Part 3461) was
not conducted for the planning effort. Any interest in coal exploration or leasing will be handled on a case-by-case
basis. If an application for a coal lease is received sometime in the future, an appropriate land use environmental
analysis will be conducted (which will include conducting the coal screening process) to determine whether or not
the coal areas applied for are acceptable for development and leasing consideration. The RMP will be amended as necessary.


In the course of conducting the planning effort and preparing the Grass Creek RMP EIS, public lands along all waterways
in the planning area were reviewed to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers
System. No public lands were found to meet the eligibility criteria. 

The draft EIS contains socio-economic information on the population, employment, and income of the planning area
and describes the impacts on the local economy of implementing each of the four alternatives analyzed in the EIS.

Wilderness management and recommendations on wilderness designation have been considered in previous documents
and are not addressed in this draft EIS. 




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Grass Creek Resource Area is responsible for managing the BLM-administered public lands in portions of Big Horn,
Hot Springs, Park, and Washakie counties in Wyoming. Within the Grass Creek RMP planning area there are varied and
intermingled land surface ownerships and overlapping mineral ownerships. Therefore, the administrative jurisdictions
for land use planning and for managing the land surface and minerals are also varied, intermingled, and sometimes
overlapping. For this reason, it is important to understand that the draft EIS does not address management of lands
(about 302,000 acres) or minerals (about 8,000 acres) within the planning area that are privately-owned or owned
by the State of Wyoming or local Governments. It also does not address those Federally-owned minerals within the planning
area that are under Federal land surface managed by other agencies (about 4,700 acres). 



The draft EIS for the Grass Creek RMP presents four alternative, multiple use resource management plans for managing
the BLM-administered public lands in the planning area. Alternative A (continuation of current management) and
three other alternatives that suggest different combinations and emphases for managing the various resource and
land uses on the BLM-administered public lands, on the basis of needs, opportunities, and public demand. The four
alternative plans focus on allocating public lands and resources among their valid uses and prescribing general
management actions that would be taken. The preferred alternative is a combination of parts of alternatives A, B,
and C and represents what BLM believes is the best balance between the public lands and resource uses and environmental
protection in the planning area. The various impacts that would be expected from implementing each of the alternatives
is also presented in the draft EIS.

in Jackson County, MO. The trackage is from the west line of Kentucky Avenue at milepost 6.93E to the end at milepost
8.35E.

1

 




KCS has certified that:

(1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years;
(2) overhead traffic, if any, which previously moved over the line, has been rerouted;
(3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on

<DOCTITLE>The Kansas City Southern Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Jasper County, MO and Cherokee County, KS </DOCTITLE>


The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCS) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_

Exempt Abandonments

 to abandon two rail branch lines as follows: (1) The Baxter Springs Branch from milepost 139.01 L at the connection
with the KCS main line to the end of the line at milepost 148.51 L near Crestline, KS, a distance of 9.50 miles, in Jasper
County, MO and Cherokee County, KS; and (2) the Waco Branch from milepost W 139.80 at the connection with the KCS main
line to the end of the line at milepost W 142.9, in Waco, MO, a distance of 2.69 miles, in Jasper County, MO. 
KCS has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic has been
rerouted; and (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or
with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements
at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication),
and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 
As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under 

Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen,

 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial
revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 
Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance has been received, this exemption
will be effective on January 21, 1995 (unless stayed pending reconsideration). Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

1

 formal expressions of intent to file offers of financial assistance under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

2

 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed by January 3, 1995.

3

 Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by January 11, 1995, with:
Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 






A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Jay M. Nadlman, 114
West Eleventh Street, Kansas City, MO 64105. 
If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, use of the exemption is void 

ab initio

. 
The Rails to Trails Conservancy (RTC) supports the abandonment and seeks issuance of a notice of interim trail use/rail
banking (NITU) under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) covering the involved lines. RTC has submitted a statement of willingness
to assume financial responsibility for the trail in compliance with 49 CFR 1152.29. KCS consents to this request and
is willing to negotiate with RTC. 
While expressions of interest in interim trail use need not be filed until 10 days after the date the notice of exemption
is published in the 

Federal Register

 [49 CFR 1152.29(b)(2)], the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) (Trails Act) are applicable, and all of the criteria for
imposing trail use/rail banking have been met. Accordingly, based on KCS' willingness to enter into negotiations
with RTC, a NITU will be issued. The parties may negotiate an agreement during the 180-day period prescribed below.
If a mutually acceptable final agreement is reached, further Commission approval is not necessary. If no agreement
is reached within 180 days, KCS may fully abandon the lines. 

See

 49 CFR 1152.29(d)(1). 
Issuance of this NITU does not preclude other parties from filing interim trail use/rail banking requests. Nor does
it preclude KCS from negotiating with other parties in addition to RTC during the NITU negotiating period. If additional
trail use requests are filed, KCS is directed to respond to them. Use of the rights-of-way for trail purposes is subject
to restoration for railroad purposes. 
The parties should note that operation of the trail use procedures could be delayed, or even foreclosed, by the financial
assistance process under 49 U.S.C. 10905. As stated in 

Rail Abandonments_Use of Rights-of-Way as Trails,

 2 I.C.C.2d 591 (1986) (Trails), offers of financial assistance (OFA) to acquire rail lines for continued rail service
or to subsidize rail operations take priority over interim trail use conditions.

4

 Accordingly, if a formal expression of intent to file an OFA is timely filed under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), the effective
date of this notice will be postponed 10 days beyond the effective date indicated here. In addition, the effective
date may be further postponed at later stages in the OFA process. 

See

 49 CFR 1152.27(e)(2) and (f). Finally, if the line is sold under the OFA procedures, the notice for abandonment exemption
will be dismissed and trail use precluded. Alternatively, if a sale under the OFA procedures does not occur, trail
use may proceed. 




KCS has filed an environmental report addressing the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic
resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by December
27, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser at (202) 927-6248. Comments on environmental and historic
preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public.

<TEXT>
 

Environmental, historic preservation, or other trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate,
in a subsequent decision. 


It is ordered: 
1. Subject to the conditions set forth above, KCS may discontinue service, cancel tariffs for the lines on not less
than 10 days' notice to the Commission, and salvage track and material consistent with interim trail use/rail banking
after the effective date of this notice of exemption and NITU. Tariff cancellations must refer to this notice by date
and docket number. 
2. If an interim trail use/rail banking agreement is reached, then with respect to the rights-of-way, it must require
the trail user to assume, for the term of the agreement, full responsibility for management of, for any legal liability
arising out of the transfer or use of (unless the user is immune from liability, in which case it need only indemnify
KCS from any potential liability), and for the payment of any and all taxes that may be levied or assessed against, the
rights-of-way. 
3. Interim trail use/rail banking is subject to the future restoration of rail service and to the user's continuing
to meet the financial obligations for the rights-of-way. 
4. If interim trail use is implemented and subsequently the user intends to terminate trail use, it must send the Commission
a copy of this notice of exemption and NITU and request that it be vacated on a specified date.
5. If an agreement for interim trail use/rail banking is reached by the 180th day after service of this decision and
notice, interim trail use may be implemented. If no agreement is reached by that time, KCS may fully abandon the lines.

6. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance has been received, this notice
of exemption and NITU will be effective on January 21, 1995.



Decided: December 15, 1994.

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>






Robert C. Davis, M.D., Revocation of Registration



On June 27, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued to Robert C. Davis, M.D. (Respondent), an Order to Show Cause proposing to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate
of Registration, AD2917182, and to deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The statutory
basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public
interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), based upon criminal convictions in the United States
District Court, District of Utah. These criminal convictions included Medicaid, insurance and mail fraud counts,
as well as some counts pertaining to prescribing controlled substances not for a legitimate medical purpose and not
in the course of professional practice. The proposed action was also based upon Respondent's lack of state authorization
to handle controlled substances in the State of Utah. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). 

The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail and was received by him on July 5, 1994. Respondent
filed a request for hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was docketed before Administrative
Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On August 3, 1994, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition based upon an
order of the State of Utah, Department of Commerce, Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (Licensing
Board) which revoked Respondent's medical license and authority to handle controlled substances for an indefinite
period, effective July 7, 1993. In his response to the Government's motion, Respondent argued that a hearing on this
matter should be held because Respondent was appealing the criminal convictions on which the Licensing Board's revocation
order was based and that Respondent would reapply for a medical license in the State of Utah if his convictions were
overturned on appeal. 

On August 19, 1994, in her opinion and recommended decision, the administrative law judge granted the Government's
motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, issued to him
in Utah, be revoked based upon Respondent's current lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances
in Utah. Neither party filed exceptions to the recommended decision. 

On September 22, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy
Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues
his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. 

The Deputy Administrator finds that on July 7, 1994, the State of Utah, Department of Commerce, Division of Occupational
and Professional Licensing issued an order revoking Respondent's medical license. As a result, he is not currently
authorized by Utah to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain
the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which
he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld.
See

 James H. NIckens, M.D., 57 FR 59847 (1992); Elliott F. Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919
(1988). 

The administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. It is well-settled that when
no question of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversary administrative proceeding
involving evidence and cross-examination of witnesses is not obligatory. The rationale is that Congress does not
intend administrative agencies to perform meaningless tasks. Philip E. Kirk, M.D., 48 FR 32887 (1983); aff'd. sub
nom 

Kirk

 v. 

Mullen

 749 F.2d 297 (6th Cir. 1984); Alfred Tennyson Smurthwaite, N.D., 43 FR 11873 (1978); see also, 

NLRB

 v. 

International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Ironworkers, AFL-CIO,

 549 F.2d 634 (9th Cir. 1977); 

United States

 v. 

Consolidated Mines and Smelting Co., Ltd., 

455 F.2d 432, 453 (9th Cir. 1971). 

Respondent argues that the criminal convictions, which he maintains were the only basis of the Licensing Board's
revocation order, could be overturned on appeal and that Respondent then would reapply and obtain his state medical
license. This scenario is only speculation. Until the Licensing Board reinstates Respondent's medical license,
the DEA does not have the statutory authority under the Controlled Substances Act to continue the registration of
a practitioner unless that practitioner is currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the state where
he is registered with the DEA.

The Deputy Administrator, having considered the entire record, adopts the administration law judge's opinion and
recommended decision in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that DEA
Certificate of Registration, AD2917182, previously issued to Robert C. Davis, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked
and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective
December 12, 1994.

to one and one-quarter hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing information/data
sources, gathering and maintaining the information/data needed, and preparing the application. The reporting
burden is expected to increase due to the proposed requirement that employers provide notice to H-1B nonimmigrants
of the terms and conditions of employment. The employer will be required to attest that it has provided, or will provide,
to each H-1B nonimmigrant a copy of the Labor Condition Application (LCA) under which they are employed no later
than the date the H-1B nonimmigrant reports to work at the place of employment. This is the only amendment contained
in the final rule which is expected to increase the reporting burden per response.
Further, at the request of a number of commenters, boxes have been added to Item 7(e), ``Prevailing Wage Rate and Its
Source.'' If the employer is relying on a prevailing wage determination obtained from a State Employment Security
Agency (SESA), the employer will only be required to specify the rate and check the box marked ``SESA,'' as opposed
to writing the name of the agency. If the employer utilized some other source to determine the prevailing wage, the
employer must specify the rate, check the box marked ``Other,'' and specify such other source.

<DOCTITLE>In the Matter of All Reactor Licensees With Installed Thermo-Lag 330-1 Fire Barrier Material Receipt of Petitions
for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 </DOCTITLE>
 


Notice is hereby given that by separate letters dated October 21, 1994, the GE Stockholders' Alliance and Dr. D.K.
Cinquemani; by letter dated October 25, 1994, the Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy; and by letter dated October 26,
1994, R. Benjan (Petitioners) request that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) take action with regard
to the use of Thermo-Lag by all reactor licensees and that their letters be treated as Petitions pursuant to  2.206
of Title 10 of the 

Code of Federal Regulations 

(10 CFR). 
 
Dr. Cinquemani and Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy request that the NRC immediately shut down all reactors where
Thermo-Lag is used until it has been removed and replaced. GE Stockholders' Alliance requests shutdown of all reactors
where Thermo-Lag is used until it has been removed and replaced with fire-retardant material meeting NRC standards.
R. Benjan requests immediate shutdown of all reactors where Thermo-Lag is used. 
 
As the bases for their requests, the Petitioners state, either individually or collectively, that 
 
(1) the widespread use of Thermo-Lag, in more than 70 reactors, presents a safety crisis; 
 
(2) the NRC has known since 1982 that Thermo-Lag fails NRC performance standards for material that protects vital
electrical cables for ampacity rating and fire resistance; 
 
(3) Thermo-Lag has failed not only NRC tests, but almost all other independent tests; 
 
(4) Thermo-Lag is combustible, contrary to NRC regulations, and is an ineffective fire barrier; 
 
(5) the use of Thermo-Lag could lead to shorts, to failure of the cables in an emergency, and to fire; 
 
(6) Thermo-Lag is faulty in that fraudulent ampacity ratings allowed utilities to use smaller cable than permitted
by design requirements, causing the cable to overheat and its insulation to deteriorate; 
 
(7) the NRC has stated that fire at some nuclear power plants can contribute as much as 50 percent of the risk to a core
meltdown, and a typical reactor will have three to four significant fires during its licensed lifetime; 
 
(8) Thermal Science, Inc., the manufacturer of Thermo-Lag, and its president were indicted by Federal grand jury
on seven criminal charges related to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Government in regard to the effectiveness of Thermo-Lag;
and 
 
(9) the hourly fire watches at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power plant operated by Toledo Edison do not replace fire barrier
material and do not prevent fires. 
 
The Petitions are being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commissions regulations and have been referred to the
Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. As provided by 10 CFR 2.206, appropriate action will be taken
on these petitions within a reasonable time. By letter dated December 15, 1994, the Director denied the requests of
GE Stockholders' Alliance, Dr. Cinquemani, Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy, and R. Benjan for immediate suspension
of the operating licenses of all reactors where Thermo-Lag is used. 
 
Copies of the Petitions are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW,
Washington, DC. 
 


 
 

Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of December 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited Technologies Receipt of Application for Design Certification</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has received an application from
Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited Technologies dated September 30, 1994, filed pursuant to Section 103 of the Atomic
Energy Act and 10 CFR Part 52, for the standard design certification of the CANDU 3U Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor
Plant. A notice relating to the rulemarking pursuant to 10 CFR 52.51 for design certification, including provisions
for participation of the public and other parties, will be published in the future.

The CANDU 3U is a 450 MWe pressurized heavy water reactor design. A unique feature that distinguishes the CANDU 3U from
the current generation of light water reactors designed in the United States is the use of natural uranium fuel contained
in a pressurized heavy water coolant system and a separate heavy water moderator system. The CANDU 3U application
includes the entire power generation complex, except those elements and features considered site specific.

The staff has determined that the application does not contain all information required by 10 CFR 52.47. A docket number
is being assigned to the application to facilitate public access to correspondence and review information. Although
no formal review schedule will be established until an updated Safety Analysis Report and schedules for all information
required has been received, the NRC staff will continue limited review of the application. This is consistent with
the letter of September 30, 1994, ``. . . that no major activity will be initiated by 


the NRC beyond the acceptance review . . . .''

A copy of the application is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman
Building, 2120 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Previous correspondence on this application is filed under Project
number 679. The new docket established for this application is STN-52-005.

Susquehanna Steam Electric Station Units 1 & 2; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility
Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-14 & NPF-22 issued to Pennsylvania Power & Light Company for operation of the
Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. 

The proposed amendment would add the Special Test Exception 3/4.10.6, ``Inservice Leak and Hydrostatic Testing,''
that allows the performance of pressure testing at reactor coolant temperature up to 212
 F while remaining in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4. This special test exception would also require that certain OPERATIONAL
CONDITION 3 Specifications for Secondary Containment Isolation, Secondary Containment Integrity and Standby
Gas Treatment System operability be met. This change would also revise the Index, Table 1.2, ``OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS,''
and the Bases to incorporate the reference to the proposed special test exception. 

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed changes are requested to allow inservice leak and hydrostatic testing, with the reactor in OPERATIONAL
CONDITION 4 and the average reactor coolant temperature up to 212
 F. The change to allow inservice leak and hydrostatic testing in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 will not increase the
probability or the consequences of an accident. The probability of a leak in the reactor coolant pressure boundary
during inservice leak and hydrostatic testing is not increased by considering the reactor in OPERATIONAL CONDITION
4. The hydrostatic or inservice leak test is performed water solid or near water solid, and temperatures less than
or equal to 212
 F. The stored energy in the reactor core will be very low and the potential for failed fuel and a subsequent increase
in coolant activity above Technical Specification limits are minimal. In addition, secondary containment will
be operable and capable of handling airborne radioactivity from leaks that could occur during the performance of
hydrostatic or inservice leak testing. Requiring the secondary containment to be operable will ensure that potential
airborne radiation from leaks will be filtered through the Standby Gas Treatment System, thus limiting radiation
releases to the environment. Therefore, the change will not significantly increase the consequences of an accident.


In the event of a large primary system leak, the reactor vessel would rapidly depressurize allowing the low pressure
ECCS systems to operate. The capability of the systems that are required for OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 would be adequate
to keep the core flooded under this condition. Small system leaks would be detected by leakage inspections before
significant inventory loss occurred. This is an integral part of the hydrostatic testing program. Therefore, this
change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

Allowing the reactor to be considered in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 during hydrostatic or leak testing, with a reactor
coolant temperature of up to 212
 F, is an exception to certain OPERATIONAL CONDITION 3 requirements, including primary containment integrity
and total Emergency Core Cooling System operability. The hydrostatic or inservice leakage test is performed water
solid, or near water solid, and coolant temperature less than or equal to 212
 F. The stored energy in the reactor core will be very low and the potential for failed fuel and a subsequent increase
in coolant activity above Technical Specification limits are minimal. In addition, the secondary containment will
be operable and capable of handling airborne radioactivity from leaks that could occur during the performance of
hydrostatic or inservice leakage testing. 

The inservice leak or hydrostatic test conditions remain unchanged. The potential for a system leak remains unchanged
since the reactor coolant system is designed for temperatures exceeding 500
 F with similar pressures. There are no alternations of any plant systems that cope with the spectrum of accidents.
The only difference is that a different subset of systems would be utilized for accident mitigation from those of OPERATIONAL
CONDITION 3. Therefore, this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated. 

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The proposed change allows inservice leak and hydrostatic testing to be performed with a reactor coolant temperature
up to 212
 F and the reactor in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4. Since the reactor vessel head will be in place, secondary containment
integrity will be maintained and all systems required in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 will be operable in accordance with
the Technical Specifications, the proposed change will not have any significant impact on any design bases accident
or safety limit. The hydrostatic or inservice leak testing is performed water solid, or near water solid, and temperature
less than or equal to 212
 F. The stored energy in the core is very low and the potential for failed fuel and a subsequent increase in coolant
activity would be minimal. The reactor pressure vessel would rapidly depressurize in the event of a large primary
system leak and the low pressure injection systems required to be operable in OPERATION CONDITION 4 would be adequate
to keep the core flooded. This would ensure that the fuel would not exceed the 2200
 F peak clad temperature limit. 

Also requiring secondary containment integrity will assure that potential airborne radiation can be filtered through
the SGTS. This will assure that offsite does remain well within the limits of 10 CFR 100 guidelines. Small system leaks
would be detected by inspections before significant inventory loss could occur. Therefore, this special test exception
will not involve a significant reduction in safety margin. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication data and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. 

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman
of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors; (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The Petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the basis of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
If a hearing is requested, the commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed,
plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Jay Silberg, Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts, and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street NW., Washington,
DC 20037, attorney for the licensee.
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(l)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated October 21, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC, and at the local public document room located at the Osterhout Free Library, Reference Department,

<DOCTITLE>In the Matter of Tennessee Valley Authority; Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Units
1, 2, and 3; Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I



The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33,
DPR-52, DPR-68, DPR-77, DPR-79 for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 1, 2 and 3 (BFN) and
the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (SQN), respectively. For the Watts Bar nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (WBN), TVA
is the holder of Construction Permits CPPR-91 and CPPR-92, respectively, since Operating Licenses have
not been issued. The licenses provide, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations,
and orders of the Commission in effect now and hereafter.

The facilities consist of two pressurized water reactors at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2, located in Soddy
Daisy, Tennessee; three boiling water reactors at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Units 1, 2 and 3, located in Limestone
County, Alabama; and two pressurized water reactors under construction at Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2,
located at TVA's site on the west bank of the Tennessee River approximately 50 miles northeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee.



II



Title 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against
radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), in part, states that ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite
physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance
that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not
constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.''

10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that ``The licensee shall control all points
of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) requires that ``A numbered picture badge
identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.''
10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized
access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the
protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area . . .''

TVA has proposed to implement an alternative unescorted access control system that would eliminate the need to issue
and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access to keep
their badges with them when departing the site.

An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges
offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated October 24, 1994, TVA requested an exemption
from the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose.



III



Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person
or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger
life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55,
the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide alternative measures for protection against radiological sabotage
provided the licensee demonstrates that the alternative measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and
meet ``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance
provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.

Currently, unescorted access into the protected areas at the operating TVA plants is controlled through the use of
a photograph on a badge/keycard (hereafter, referred to as ``badge''). The security officers at each entrance station
use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both TVA employees
and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are issued upon entrance at each entrance/exit
location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at each entrance/exit location. In
accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractors are not allowed to take these badges offsits.

Under the proposed biometric system, each individual who is authorized unescorted entry into protected areas would
have the physical characteristics of his/her hand (i.e., hand geometry) registered, along with his/her badge number,
in the access control system. When a registered user enters his/her badge into the card reader and places his/her hand
onto the measuring surface, the system detects that the hand is properly positioned, and records the image. The unique
characteristics of the hand image is then compared with the previously stored template in the access control computer
system corresponding to the badge to verify authorization for entry.

Individuals, including TVA employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart
the site and, thus, eliminate the need to issue, retrieve and store badges at the entrance stations to the plant. Badges
do not carry any information other then a unique identification number. All other access processes, including search
function capability, would remain the same. This system would not be used for persons requiring escorted access;
i.e., visitors.

Based on a Sandia report entitled, ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometrics Identification Devices'' (SAND910276
UC_906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on its experience with the current photo-identification system,
TVA determined that the false-accept rate for the hand geometry system will be at least equal to the current photo-identification
system in used at the TVA plants. The biometric system has been in use for a number of years at several sensitive Department
of Energy facilities and, recently, at nuclear power plants.

TVA will implement a process for testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent
to that specified in the regulation. When the changes are implemented, the respective Physical Security Plans will
be revised to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow TVA employees
and contractors to take their badges offsite.

When implemented, TVA will control all points of personnel access into a protected area under the observation of security
personnel through the use of a badge and hand geometry verification system. The numbered picture badge identification
system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized unescorted access to protected areas. Badges
will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.
Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would
provide a positive verification process. The potential loss of a badge by an individual as a result of taking the badge
offsite would not enable an unauthorized entry into protected areas.


IV


For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures
for protection against radiological sabotage meet ``the same high assurance objective,'' and ``the general performance
requirements'' of the regulation and that ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against
radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) relating to the returning
of picture badges upon exit from the protected area such that individuals not employed by TVA, i.e., contractors,
who are authorized unescorted access into the protected areas at the Browns Ferry, Sequoyah, and Watts Bar Nuclear
Plants can take their badges offsite.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 61351).
For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated October 24, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local
public document room located at the Athens Public Library, South Street, Athens, Alabama (for the BFN Plant), and
at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402 (for the SQN and WBN
Plants).
This exemption is effective upon issuance. It is expected to be implemented for each plant separately when modifications,
procedures, and training are completed at the respective plant.



Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 15th day of December 1994.

<USDEPT>POSTAL SERVICE</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of amendment and addition of new routine uses for existing system of records. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice provides information for public comment on the Postal Service's proposal to amend USPS Privacy Act System
050.005_Finance Records_Accounts Receivable Files Maintenance. The Postal Service proposes to delete one category
of individuals covered by the system, to make minor editorial changes for clarity, and to add four new routine uses.



The new routine uses will permit the Postal Service to disclose to other federal agencies certain information identifying
Postal Service debtors and to implement new procedures that will facilitate recovery of those debts. The proposed
new routine uses will enable the Postal Service to participate in a computer matching program with the Department
of Defense to identify Postal Service debtors employed by other federal agencies, to initiate salary offset where
appropriate, and to initiate income tax refund offset for non-federal employee debtors. In addition, a new routine
use will enable the Postal Service to use the taxpayer address verification process of the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). 
This notice complies with subsection (e)(11) of the Privacy Act, which requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any new use of information in a system of records.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Postal Service is expanding its debt recovery procedures in order to recover more of its delinquent debt. To do
so, the Postal Service plans to participate in the federal salary offset program administered by the Financial Management
Service, Office of the Treasury, and the federal income tax refund offset and taxpayer address verification programs
administered by the IRS. The amendments proposed here are necessary to implement the new procedures in compliance
with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. A full description of USPS Privacy Act System 050.005 was last published at
54 FR 43667, dated October 26, 1989, and amended at 57 FR 57516, dated December 4, 1992. 


The Postal Service is modifying the name of this system of records to ``Accounts Receivable Files,'' a more comprehensive
name that better describes the system of records. 
The Postal Service is deleting from Categories of Individuals Covered by the System those customers whose checks
are returned by the bank. These types of debts are no longer included in the Accounts Receivable automated system as
part of the system of records. Accordingly, each such customer's bank name and account number, date and amount of check,
and identifying number from driver's license, passport, or military ID are being deleted from Categories of Records
in the System. 
The Postal Service is adding four new routine uses for USPS Privacy Act System 050.005. Proposed new routine use number
4 of this system provides for the disclosure of the names and social security numbers of Postal Service debtors to the
Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) of the Department of Defense for conducting a computer matching program to identify
and locate debtors who are federal employees in order to initiate salary offset procedures. Proposed new routine
use number 5 provides for the disclosure of debtor-identifying information to any federal agency where the debtor
is employed to enable that agency to collect the debt on behalf of the Postal Service through salary offset. Proposed
new routine use number 6 provides for the disclosure of debtor-identifying information to the IRS through computer
matching to obtain the current mailing addresses of non-federal employee taxpayers for locating the taxpayers to
collect postal debts. Proposed new routine use number 7 provides for the disclosure of debtor-identifying information
to the IRS to enable the IRS to collect the debt on behalf of the Postal Service through income tax refund offset. 
Because the above disclosures each will assist in the recovery of Postal Service debt, these new routine uses are clearly
compatible with the purposes for which records are maintained in USPS Privacy Act System 050.005. The above-described
amendments and the addition of these routine uses require submission of an altered system report; the report was submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget and both houses of Congress 10 days before publication of this notice.

collection of the debts under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365) through salary and/or administrative
offset procedures. 
5. Disclosure of information about individuals indebted to the Postal Service may be made to any federal agency where
the debtor is employed or receiving some form of remuneration for enabling that agency to collect the debt on behalf
of the Postal Service by counseling to debtor for voluntary repayment, or by initiating administrative or salary
offset procedures under the Debt Collection Act of 1982. 
6. Disclosure of information about individuals indebted to the Postal Service may be made to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) through computer matching to obtain the mailing address of a taxpayer for locating such taxpayer to
collect a debt owed to the Postal Service pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2) and in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3717,
and 3718.

 



Note:

 Disclosure of a mailing address obtained from the IRS may be made only for debt collection, including to a debt collection
agency in order to facilitate the collection of a federal claim under the Debt Collection Act of 1982. A mailing address
may be provided to a consumer reporting agency for the limited purpose of obtaining a commercial credit report on the
individual taxpayer. Any such address information obtained from the IRS will not be used or shared for any other purpose
by the Postal Service.

 

7. Disclosure of information about individuals indebted to the Postal Service may be made to the IRS for effecting
income tax refund offset procedures against the debtor pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3720A.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





applicants: 

The Charles Allmon Trust, Inc. (the ``Trust'') and Liberty Asset Management Company (``LAMCO'').




relevant act sections: 

Order requested under section 6(c) for an exemption from section 15(a) of the Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary of application: 

The Trust and LAMCO, for themselves and on behalf of present and future sub-advisers of the Trust, request a conditional
order of exemption from section 15(a) of the Act with respect to the portion of the Trust's assets subject to LAMCO's
supervision. The requested order would let the Trust and LAMCO change or add sub-advisers, or continue the services
of a sub-adviser following an assignment of its sub-advisory agreement, and delay shareholder approval of the new
sub-advisory agreements with such sub-advisers until the Trust's next annual meeting of shareholders.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Trust is a closed-end diversified management investment company whose shares are listed and traded on the New
York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''). In accordance with NYSE rules, the Trust holds annual meetings of shareholders.
LAMCO, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, is a registered investment adviser
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

2. From its inception in 1986 through May 27, 1994, the Trust's sole investment manager and administrator was Growth
Stock Outlook Inc. (``GSO''). On May 27, 1994, following shareholder approval, the Trust entered into a fund management
agreement with LAMCO. Under the terms of that agreement, LAMCO provides a ``multi-manager'' methodology of portfolio
management with respect to an initial amount equal to 20% of the Trust's total net assets (the ``Multi-Managed Assets'').
The remainder of the Trust's assets are managed by GSO acting under a separate investment advisory agreement.

3. The Multi-Managed Assets may be increased or decreased as a result of investment income, gains or losses on such
assets, and dividends, distributions and operating expenses payable on such assets. In addition, under the terms
of an Asset Acquisition and Fund Management Transition Agreement dated February 9, 1994, among LAMCO, GSO and GSO's
principal stockholder, it is contemplated that, subject to certain conditions that must be met prior to the Trust's
1996 annual meeting of shareholders, a new fund management agreement may be entered into with LAMCO with respect to
all the assets of the Trust.

4. LAMCO has allocated the Multi-Managed Assets on an approximately equal basis among three independent investment
management firms (the ``Sub-Advisers'') acting under identical sub-advisory agreements with the Trust and LAMCO
approved by shareholders at their May 27, 1994 meeting. LAMCO selected and recommended the Sub-Advisers using certain
specific criteria. In that regard, each of the present and future Sub-Advisers must consistently employ a distinct,
identifiable investment style that differs from those of the other Sub-Advisers. Further, the range of styles must
be sufficiently broad so that at least one of them may be expected to be in favor in all reasonably foreseeable market
conditions. Finally, each Sub-Adviser's longer-term investment performance must be satisfactory when compared
to other investment management firms employing a similar style. The goal of this multi-manager methodology as applied
to the Multi-Managed Assets is to produce better investment performance over time with less volatility than that
of the average single-manager fund with the same investment objective and policies.

5. LAMCO continuously reviews the performance of the Sub-Advisers to identify the presence of factors or conditions
that would tend to neutralize the effect of the multi-management methodology as applied to the Multi-Managed Assets,
such as a departure by a Sub-Adviser from its investment style, a deterioration in its investment performance relative
to that of other investment management firms employing similar styles, or an adverse change in its personnel or organization.
Based upon its review, LAMCO recommends appropriate changes in Sub-Advisers.

<TEXT>
 

6. Each new sub-advisory agreement would affect no more than approximately one-third of the Multi-Managed Assets.
Accordingly, no more than approximately one-third of 20% of the Trust's total net assets currently will be affected
by any one Sub-Adviser change. In the future, because the amount of the Trust's total net assets represented by the
Multi-Managed Assets may increase or decrease in a manner described in paragraph 3 above, any one Sub-Adviser change
may affect a greater or lesser amount of the Trust's total net assets, but never more than approximately one-third
of the Trust's total net assets.
7. In addition, each new sub-advisory agreement would contain substantially the same terms and conditions as the
existing sub-advisory agreements for the Multi-Managed Assets. A new Sub-Adviser's fee can be no higher than that
provided in the Trust's three existing sub-advisory agreements. In the event that fees under the new sub-advisory
agreement are less than in the existing agreements, the difference will be passed on to the Trust through a corresponding
reduction in the fund management fee payable to LAMCO.
8. None of the Sub-Advisers has any affiliation with the Trust or LAMCO other than as Sub-Adviser. The responsibility
of the Sub-Advisers under their respective sub-advisory agreements is limited to the discretionary investment
management of the respective portions of the Multi-Managed Assets assigned to them by LAMCO from time to time, and
related record keeping and reporting. The Multi-Managed Assets are and will be allocated and periodically rebalanced
so as to maintain an approximately equal allocation of such assets among the Sub-Advisers.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 15(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment
company except pursuant to a written contract, whether with such registered company or with an investment adviser
of such registered company, which has been approved by the majority vote of the outstanding voting securities of such
registered company. Section 15(a)(4) also requires that the investment advisory contract provide, in substance,
for its automatic termination in the event of its assignment.
2. Rule 15a-4 under the Act permits an investment adviser to an investment company to act under an agreement not
approved by shareholders for up to 120 days after the termination of an investment advisory agreement resulting from
certain specified events. Applicants claim, however, that rule 15a-4 does not provide adequate relief to the
Trust. For one thing, a change in Sub-Advisers may occur more than 120 days before the next regularly scheduled annual
meeting, resulting in the necessity of a special meeting of shareholders. In addition, rule 15a-4 does not apply
at all to an investment advisory agreement entered into following a termination of the prior agreement caused by an
assignment in which the investment adviser or its controlling person receives an economic benefit.
3. Applicants submit that requiring shareholder approval consistent with section 15(a) before changing a Sub-Adviser
or before continuing the services of an existing Sub-Adviser following an assignment of its sub-advisory agreement
results in substantial delay or expense to the Trust, without any corresponding benefit in terms of shareholder protection.
4. Applicants assert that, because of the lack of affiliation between LAMCO and the Sub-Advisers (unlike conventionally
structured single-manager investment companies), LAMCO has no interest other than the efficient and effective
functioning of the Trust's multi-manager methodology and the enhancement of the Trust's investment performance
when recommending the replacement or addition of a Sub-adviser or the continuation of the services of the Sub-Adviser
following an assignment of its sub-advisory agreement. Furthermore, Applicants represent that neither LAMCO nor
any of its affiliates will be parties to the acquisition or other transaction giving rise to the termination and assignment
of the sub-advisory agreement and, consequently, will not receive any economic benefit in connection with such transaction.
5. Applicants also assert that the terms and conditions of the Trust's ``employment'' of its Sub-Advisers will in
effect have already been approved by shareholders because any new sub-advisory agreements will be identical in all
material respects to the existing agreements which have been approved by shareholders, with no increase in expense
to the Trust.

6. Applicants further assert that, in view of the limited function of the Sub-Advisers and the fact that no more than
approximately one-third of the Multi-Managed Assets will be affected by any one Sub-Adviser change, addition or
continuation, the Trust's shareholders are significantly less dependent on any one Sub-Adviser than are the shareholders
of a conventionally structured single manager fund. As a result, the need for the protection provided by the shareholder
approval requirement of section 15(a) is correspondingly less.

7. Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the SEC to exempt persons or transactions from the provisions of the Act to the
extent that such exemptions are necessary or approximate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by he policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit that the requested
exemptive relief from section 15(a) would be consistent with the standards set forth in section 6(c) of the Act and
would be in the best interests of the Trust and its shareholders.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each new sub-advisory agreement will be submitted for ratification and approval to the vote of the Trust's shareholders
no later than at the regularly scheduled annual meeting of shareholders of the Trust next following the effective
date of the new sub-advisory agreement, and its continuance after such meeting will be conditioned on approval by
the required majority vote of such shareholders.

2. The Trust will continue to hold annual meetings of its shareholders, whether or not required to do so by the rules
of the NYSE or otherwise.

3. The directors of the Trust, in addition to approving the new sub-advisory agreement in accordance with the requirements
of section 15(c) of the Act, will specifically determine that entering into the new sub-advisory agreement in advance
of the next regular annual meeting of shareholders of the Trust and without prior shareholder approval is in furtherance
of the multi-manager methodology as applied to the Multi-Managed Assets and is in the best interests of the Trust and
its shareholders.

4. The new sub-advisory agreement involved will, when entered into, affect no more than approximately one-third
of the Multi-Managed Assets.

5. The new Sub-Adviser will have no affiliation with the Trust or LAMCO other than as Sub-Adviser, and will have no duties
or responsibilities with respect to the Trust beyond the investment management of the portion of the Multi-Managed
Assets allocated to it by LAMCO from time to time and related record keeping and reporting.

6. The new sub-advisory agreement will provide for a portfolio management fee no higher than that provided in the Trust's
existing sub-advisory agreements with respect to the Multi-Managed Assets, and, except for the provisions relating
to shareholder approval referred to in condition 1 above, will be on substantially the same other terms and conditions
as such existing agreements. In the event that the new sub-advisory agreement provides for sub-advisory fees at rates
less than those provided in the existing sub-advisory agreements, the difference will be passed on to the Trust and
its shareholders through a corresponding voluntary reduction in the fund agreement fee payable by the Trust to LAMCO.

7. The appointment of the new or successor Sub-Adviser will be announced by press release promptly following the directors'
action referred to in condition 3 above, and a notice of the new sub-advisory agreement, together with a description
of the new or successor Sub-Adviser, will be included in the Trust's next report to shareholders.

8. LAMCO will provide overall supervisory responsibility for the general management and investment of the Multi-Manager
Assets, subject to the Trust's investment objectives and policies and any directions of the Trust's directors. In
particular, LAMCO will (i) provide overall investment programs and strategies for the Multi-Managed Assets, (ii)
recommend to the Trust's directors investment management firms for appointment or replacement as Sub-Advisers
for the Multi-Managed Assets, (iii) allocate and reallocate the Multi-Managed Assets among the Sub-Advisers, and
(iv) monitor and evaluate the investment performance of the Sub-Advisers, including their compliance with the Trust's
investment objectives, policies and restrictions.

9. In the case of a new sub-advisory agreement with an existing Sub-Adviser or its successor following an ``assignment,''
as that term is defined in the Act and the rules thereunder, of the Trust's sub-advisory agreement with that Sub-Adviser,
the Sub-Adviser (or its successor) or LAMCO will pay the incremental cost of including the proposal to approve or disapprove
ratification of the new sub-advisory agreement in the proxy material for the Trust's next annual meeting of shareholders.

the diversification and investment objectives. Accordingly, on or about October 24, 1994, proxy materials were
distributed to shareholders. On November 1, 1994, the holders of a majority of the shares voted to take all necessary
and advisable actions to effect the winding-up and dissolution of applicant's business. On November 18, 1994, all
of applicants' outstanding shares were redeemed and payments were made at applicant's net asset value.

3. Distributions to all securityholders in complete liquidation of their interests have been made. Applicant incurred
$894 in total brokerage commissions with respect to sales of its portfolio securities.

4. On October 24, 1994, there were issued and outstanding 196,764 shares of common stock having a net asset value of
$9.08 per share and $1,786,617 in the aggregate.

5. Liquidation expenses of approximately $6,800 for transfer agency, accounting, custody, tax reporting and legal
fees will be borne by Wood Island Associates, Inc., applicant's investment adviser.

6. As of the date of this application, applicant has no debts or liabilities and is not a party to any litigation or administrative
proceeding. Applicant is neither engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than
those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs.

Independent Regulatory Appeals Process 



Agency: 

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury. 



Action: 

Notice and request for comments. 




<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is requesting comments on its guidelines that permit national
banks to appeal certain OCC decisions and actions. This Action is required by the Riegle Community Development and
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The OCC intends to use the comments in evaluating whether changes to the proposed
guidelines are appropriate. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Section 309(a) of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-325
(12 U.S.C. 4806) (the Act), which was signed into law on September 23, 1994, requires the OCC, the Office of Thrift Supervision,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board (Federal banking agencies) and the National
Credit Union Administration to establish an independent internal appellate process. This process must be available
to review material supervisory determinations made at insured depository institutions or credit unions that the
agency supervises. Section 309(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 4806(c)) requires that each Federal banking agency must provide
public notice and opportunity for comment on its proposed guidelines for this appellate process by December 22, 1994,
and establish this process by March 22, 1995. 
The Act defines ``independent appellate process'' in section 309(f)(2) (12 U.S.C. 4806(f)(2)) as a review by an agency
official who does not directly or indirectly report to the agency official who made the material supervisory determination
under review. In addition, this Act defines ``material supervisory determinations'' in section 309(f)(1) (12 U.S.C.
4806(f)(1)) to include determinations relating to (1) examination ratings, (2) the adequacy of loan loss reserve
provisions, and (3) loan classifications on loans that are significant to an institution. This definition expressly
excludes determinations to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution or a decision
to take prompt corrective action pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1831o).

In addition, section 309(g) (12 U.S.C. 4806(g)) expressly provides that the Act's requirement to establish an appeals
process does not affect the authority of the banking agencies to take enforcement or supervisory actions against
an institution. Finally, section 309(b) (12 U.S.C. 4906(b)) of the Act requires that appeals be heard and decided
expeditiously and that appropriate safeguards exist for protecting the appellant from retaliation by agency examiners.



Existing OCC Appeals Process 


The OCC's existing procedures for national banks to appeal agency decisions and actions were published in Banking
Circular No. 272, dated June 11, 1993. These procedures have been modified and clarified in the proposed guidelines
to be consistent with the requirements of the Act. Until these guidelines are published in final form in the 

Federal Register

, the current OCC appeals policy as set forth in Banking Circular No. 272 remains in effect. The OCC's appeals policy
does not supersede any existing appeals procedures available under current law.

The OCC's appeals process provides that a national bank may file its appeal either with the District Administrator
or Deputy Comptroller of the OCC District in which the bank is headquartered (or the Deputy Comptroller for the appropriate
program in Washington, D.C. if the bank is a multinational bank or under special supervision), or directly with the
Ombudsman. The proposed guidelines clarify that the term national bank includes a Federal branch or agency of a foreign
bank. 
The District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller normally does not directly or indirectly participate in making
reviewable supervisory decisions nor report directly or indirectly to the agency official who made the reviewable
decision. In addition, the national bank may always file its appeal with the Ombudsman who is outside the bank supervision
area, reporting only to the Comptroller. Therefore, the OCC believes that its appeals process complies with the Act's
requirement that appeals be heard by an agency official who does not report directly or indirectly to the agency official
who made the material supervisory determination under review. 
However, to further assure that the appeals process remains completely independent, the OCC has added a provision
to require the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller to transfer an appeal to the Ombudsman if the District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller directly or indirectly participated in making the decision under review or
reports directly or indirectly to the agency official who made the decision under review. In addition, the OCC has
added a provision to require the Ombudsman to transfer an appeal to the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision
Policy if the Ombudsman should be recused from reviewing the decision under appeal. 
The OCC also is proposing to extend the period of time in which the District Administrator, Deputy Comptroller, or
Ombudsman must make a decision on an appeal. Currently, the OCC's policy requires that the District Administrator
or the Deputy Comptroller, in the absence of any extenuating circumstances, issue a written response within 20 calendar
days of the filing of an appeal, and that the Ombudsman issue a written response within 30 calendar days of the filing
of an appeal. In addition, the Ombudsman must issue a written response to a second-tier appeal, which is an appeal by
a national bank of an appeal decision made by a District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller, within 15 calendar days
of the filing of that second-tier appeal. The OCC is proposing to extend the time period for deciding all first-tier
appeals to 45 days, and all second-tier appeals to 30 days. Based on the OCC's current experience with the appeals process,
it has found that some additional time may be necessary. The OCC believes that the time periods in the proposed guidelines
complies with the Act's requirement that an appeal be heard and decided expeditiously. 

The Act also requires that the appeals process contain appropriate safeguards for protecting the appellant from
retaliation by agency examiners. Currently, the OCC takes steps to ensure that banks are not unfairly treated because
of their appeal, although these steps are not part of the OCC's written appeals process. Specifically, the Ombudsman
makes periodic informal inquiries after a decision on an appeal is made to determine whether the bank believes the
OCC has taken action against it in retaliation for its appeal. If a bank indicates that such retaliatory action has
occurred, the Ombudsman initiates an investigation. 
To ensure that these procedures are followed for each appeal, the OCC proposes to include the Ombudsman's follow-up-inquiries
in its guidelines. Specifically, the OCC proposes that the Ombudsman contact the appellant bank to inquire whether
the bank believes that OCC examiners have taken actions against it in retaliation for its appeal within (1) six months
after the date the Ombudsman, Deputy Administrator or Deputy Comptroller issues a final written response to an appeal,
and (2) six months after the date of completion of the first examination following an appeal. In addition, national
banks that believe they are the subject of retaliation because of their appeal may, at any time, seek redress with the
Ombudsman. 
Finally, the OCC proposes to change its definition of appealable matters to expressly comply with the definition
of ``material supervisory determinations'' as provided in section 309(f)(1) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 4806(f)(1)).
The OCC's current process permits national banks to seek review of all agency decisions and actions except those involving
the appointment of receivers and conservators. Also expressly excluded are preliminary examination conclusions
communicated to the national bank prior to the issuance of either a Final Report of Examination or other written communication
from the OCC. The OCC believes that, until these preliminary conclusions become final, they are not ``material supervisory
determinations'' for purposes of the appellate procedures. Also, consistent with the Act, the OCC proposes to continue
to exclude enforcement-related actions or decisions from actions covered by the guidelines. The OCC proposes to
clarify that enforcement-related actions include decisions to take prompt corrective action pursuant to section
38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o) and, thus, are not appealable under these guidelines. 
To be consistent with the Act, the OCC proposes to add the definition of ``material supervisory determination'' to
its discussion of appealable matters. The OCC appeals policy still includes decisions and actions in addition to
those specifically identified by the Act as material supervisory determinations, unless otherwise excluded. 


Issues for Comment 


The OCC requests comments on all aspects of its appeals process. In particular, the OCC requests comments on the following
issues: 
1. Do the guidelines adequately provide independence in the appeals process? 
2. Do the guidelines adequately provide that appeals are heard and decided expeditiously? 
3. Do the guidelines adequately protect appellant banks from retaliation by OCC examiners? 
4. Is the scope of appealable matters appropriate? 
5. To what extent should the Ombudsman be bound by existing OCC policies?

National Bank Appeals Process 



The following is the OCC's Proposed Appeals Process: 



I. Policy 



The OCC is responsible for fostering the safety and soundness of the national banking system, monitoring, and enforcing
national banks' compliance with laws, and encouraging competitiveness, integrity, and stability of financial
services. In fulfilling this mission, it is the OCC's policy to maintain open and ongoing communication with the institutions
it supervises and to foster the fair and equitable administration of the supervisory process. 

If a disagreement arises during the supervisory process, the OCC will resolve the dispute fairly and expeditiously
in an informal, amicable manner. If disagreements cannot be resolved through informal discussions, national banks
and Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks (collectively referred to as ``national banks'' for purposes
of these guidelines) are encouraged, and the examiner involved in the dispute should specifically encourage the
national bank, to seek a further review of the OCC decisions or actions that are in dispute. 

These guidelines establish a mechanism through which a national bank can seek such a review. A critical element in
this appeals process is the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman is outside the bank supervision area and reports directly to
the Comptroller of the Currency. With the prior consent of the Comptroller, the Ombudsman may supersede any agency
decision or action during the resolution of an appealable matter. 

The procedures established in these guidelines provide national banks a fair and expeditious review of agency decisions
and actions while ensuring that no one is disadvantaged by the filing of an appeal. If a national bank has a question
as to whether it should make use of this appeal authority, it should contact the Ombudsman. 



II. Procedures 



A. Filing An Appeal 



A national bank may seek review of appealable matters by filing an appeal with either its immediate supervisory office
or with the OCC's Ombudsman. All communications with the Ombudsman may be sent to 1000 Louisiana Street, Suite 950,
Houston, Texas 77002-5008. The choice of where to file is a matter within the sole discretion of the bank, except
as indicated below; all appealable matters can be received in either location. However, in cases where the District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller directly or indirectly participated in making the decision under review or
directly or indirectly reports to the agency official who made the decision under review, the District Administrator
or Deputy Comptroller must transfer the appeal to the Ombudsman. In addition, in cases where the Ombudsman should
be recused from reviewing the decision under appeal, the Ombudsman shall transfer the appeal to the Senior Deputy
Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy in the OCC's Washington DC Office. The procedures for filing an appeal under
the two options are outlined below. 



1. Supervisory Office Appeals.

 If a disagreement concerning an OCC supervisory decision or action cannot be resolved informally, a national bank
may file an appeal with its immediate supervisory office. Community banks and regional banks seeking appeal under
this option should file such appeals with the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller of the OCC District in
which the bank is headquartered. Banks in the Multinational Banking or Special Supervision programs using this option
should file appeals with the Deputy Comptroller for the program in the Washington Office. In cases where the District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller directly or indirectly participated in making the decision under review or
directly or indirectly reports to the agency official who made the decision under review, the District Administrator
or Deputy Comptroller must transfer the appeal to the Ombudsman after advising the appellant. 

An appellant national banks must submit information in writing fully describing the matter in dispute and setting
forth its basis for requesting an appeal. Upon receipt of an appeal, the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy
Comptroller, or a designee who has not directly or indirectly participated in making the decision in dispute nor is
directly or indirectly responsible to the agency official who made the decision under review, will contact the OCC
employee(s) involved in the matter under appeal. The OCC employee(s) shall submit written or oral information concerning
the basis of the appeal. If requested by a senior official of the national bank filing the appeal, the appropriate District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller shall arrange a meeting or a telephone call to more fully discuss the appeal and
related issues. 

In the absence of any extenuating circumstances, the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller
shall issue a written response within 45 calendar days of the filing of the appeal. Immediately after the response
is issued, the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller shall forward to the Ombudsman copies of all relevant
materials considered in the preparation of the response, including all written submissions by the bank. 

If the national bank disagrees with the response from the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller, a senior
official of the bank may further appeal the matter to the Ombudsman. The bank must file written notice of this second-tier
appeal within 15 calendar days of receiving the response from the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller.


After receipt of a second-tier appeal, the Ombudsman shall review all materials considered by the appropriate District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller in the preparation of the initial response. The Ombudsman shall contact the
national bank to ensure that the OCC is in possession of all relevant materials. If requested by either OCC management
involved in the dispute or a senior official of the national bank filing the appeal, the Ombudsman shall arrange a meeting
or a telephone call to more fully discuss the appeal and related issues. In the absence of any extenuating circumstances,
the Ombudsman shall issue a written response to the second-tier appeal within 30 calendar days of the filing of that
appeal. 



2. Appeals to the Ombudsman

 When disagreements concerning OCC supervisory decisions and actions cannot be resolved informally and a national
bank chooses not to file an appeal with its immediate supervisory office, a national bank may file an appeal directly
with the Ombudsman. In cases where the Ombudsman should be recused from reviewing the decision under appeal, the Ombudsman
shall transfer the appeal to the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy in the OCC's Washington DC
office. In such cases, the procedures outlined below will apply.

<PARENT> FR941222-2-00096 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

National banks filing appeals with the Ombudsman must submit information in writing fully describing the matter
in dispute. After receipt of an appeal, the Ombudsman shall contact the OCC management official involved in the dispute.
That management official shall submit written materials and relevant OCC documents pertaining to the bases of the
appeal within 10 calendar days of the notice from the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman shall contact the national bank to ensure
that the OCC is in possession of all relevant materials. If requested by either OCC management involved in the dispute
or a senior official of the national bank filing the appeal, the Ombudsman shall arrange a meeting or a telephone call
to more fully discuss the appeal and related issues. In the absence of any extenuating circumstances, the Ombudsman
shall issue a written response to the appeal within 45 calendar days of the filing of the appeal by a national bank. 



B. Follow-up by Ombudsman 



After the Ombudsman receives a decision on an appeal, the Ombudsman shall contact every appellant bank to inquire
whether the bank believes OCC examiners have taken actions against the bank in retaliation for its appeal. The Ombudsman
shall make these contacts (1) six months after the date the Ombudsman, Deputy Administrator or Deputy Comptroller
issues a final written response to an appeal, and (2) six months after the date of completion of the first examination
of the appellant bank following its appeal. A national bank may, of course, contact the Ombudsman at any time during
or after the appeal if the bank reasonably believes that an OCC examiner is taking action against it in retaliation
for its appeal. Upon identifying or learning of any possible retaliatory actions, the Ombudsman shall investigate
the complaint; such investigations must be completed within 30 days. If the Ombudsman determines that retaliation
has occurred, the Ombudsman shall forward the complaint to the District Administrator, Deputy Comptroller, or Inspector
General for appropriate action. 



C. Appealable Matters 



Except as otherwise provided, a national bank may seek a review of any agency decision or action, including a material
supervisory determination. A material supervisory determination includes a determination relating to: 

 Examination ratings; 
 The adequacy of loan loss reserve provisions; and 
 Loan classifications on loans that are significant to an institution. 

A national bank may not appeal: 

 Appointments of receivers and conservators; 
 Preliminary examination conclusions communicated to the national bank prior to the issuance of either a final
Report of Examination or other written communication from the OCC; and 
 Enforcement-related actions or decisions, including decisions to take prompt corrective action pursuant
to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.  1831o). 

An enforcement-related action or decision commences, and therefore becomes unappealable, when the national bank
receives notice from the OCC indicating its intention to pursue available remedies under applicable statutes or
published enforcement-related policies of the OCC. Such policies include OCC's Policy for Corrective Action (PPM
5310-3)(REV), Civil Money Penalty Policy (PPM 5000-7)(REV), and Securities Enforcement Policy (PPM
5310-5). These policies are available on request from the OCC's Communications Division, 250 E. Street, SW.,
Washington DC 20219-0001, 202-874-4700. For purposes of these guidelines only, remarks in a Report
of Examination do not constitute notice of intent to pursue enforcement remedies. 

The appeals process established by these guidelines does not supersede any existing appeals procedures available
under current law. Matters which are subject to an existing appeals process designed specifically for the issue in
dispute, such as re-review of Shared National Credit findings (Banking Circular 189), and reconsideration of decisions
on corporate applications (12 CFR 5.13(d)), are appealable to the Ombudsman when the agency decision is final under
the specifically designed procedures. 



III. Effect of Filing An Appeal 



As a general rule, the filing of an appeal with either the national bank's immediate supervisory office or with the
Ombudsman serves to stay all agency decisions and actions until the appeal is resolved. In the appropriate circumstances,
however, the Ombudsman may put the disputed agency decision or action into effect while the appeal is still pending.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice is published in the exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the Assistant Secretary_Indian
Affairs by 209 DM 8.




The petitioner maintains that they are the descendants of the historical Houma Indian tribe. There is no evidence
supporting this contention. The historical Houma Indian tribe continued to live near present-day Donaldsonville,
Louisiana throughout the years the petitioner's antecedent community first formed on the lower bayous (between
1810 and 1830). There are no documented genealogical, social, or political connections between this tribe of Indians
and the petitioner. There is also no evidence that the petitioner, as a group, descends from any other historical tribe,
or from historical tribes which combined and functioned as a single autonomous entity.

There is no evidence that the petitioner's ancestors constituted a social community, Indian or non-Indian, before
1830. Because of this, the petitioner has also failed to meet criterion 83.7(b), maintenance of social community,
and criterion 83.7(c), exercise of political influence, prior to 1830. Lacking the evidence for an ancestral community
prior to 1830, there is, of course, no evidence for the exercise of political influence prior to 1830. The Federal acknowledgment
criteria 83.7 (b) and (c) require the petitioner to provide evidence that they fulfill criteria 83.7 (b) and (c)

 from the time of first sustained contact with Europeans 

to the present.

The migration of the UHN ancestors, the majority of whom were non-Indian (primarily French, Acadian, German, and
African) frontiersmen, to the founding Bayou Terrebonne settlement (north of present-day Montegut) started in
the 1790's. Among the settlers on Bayou Terrebonne, some of whom became ancestors of the UHN, were the three Indian
progenitors of the group. They moved there independently of each other; there is no indication that they were related
to each other socially, politically, or genealogically, before moving to the bayou settlement. The tribal affiliation
of the three Indian progenitors is not certain. One was quite possibly a Biloxi medal chief; the other two are identified
in the earliest historical records only as ``Indian women,'' with no specific tribal affiliation mentioned. There
is no evidence that these three individuals descend from the same historical tribe or from historical tribes which
combined and functioned as a single autonomous entity.


It is important to note that, for the first two generations that the founding UHN community was forming on Bayou Terrebonne
(1790 to 1830), the petitioner's Indian ancestors and their descendants tended to marry non-Indians. In spite of
this early marital pattern, and the fact that there are more non-Indian than Indian progenitors for the petitioner,
the available evidence indicates that about 84% of the UHN's current members have Indian ancestry. The Indian ancestry
originates from the three individual Indian progenitors mentioned above, the result of six generations of group
endogamy between 1830 to 1950. It is not the result of descent, as a group, from a historical tribe.


By 1830, the petitioner's ancestors, the majority of whom were non-Indian, formed an identifiable separate and distinct
community on Bayou Terrebonne. From 1830 to 1940, the limited evidence submitted by the petitioner indicates that
they tended to marry each other more frequently than they married outsiders. The strongest evidence for social community
from 1830 to 1880, however, is that more than half of the petitioner's ancestors lived in an isolated, exclusive settlement.


In the 1840's, the petitioner's ancestors started forming satellite settlements further south along Bayou Terrebonne,
on Bayou Lafourche, and on other bayous toward the west. No contemporary descriptions of the petitioner's settlements
between 1840 and 1880 were found. But based on the geographical isolation of the community on Bayou Terrebonne, we
conclude that the petitioner did maintain a distinct settlement which encompassed 50% or more of its members, from
1830 to 1880. Under the revised regulations for Federal acknowledgment, this is considered sufficient evidence
that the petitioner meets both criteria 83.7 (b) and (c) for that period as a single community. 


By 1880, the limited evidence presented by the petitioner suggests that its members' ancestors had divided into several
(six or more), socially and politically distinct, satellite communities, and no longer lived in a single community.
From 1880 to 1940, the petitioner's ancestors maintained social integrity in these satellite communities, based
on the evidence that 50% or more of them lived in geographical isolation. Within these relatively isolated communities,
there is some limited evidence that political influence was exercised through the extended kinship structure, by
elders known as 

noncs

 `uncles' and 

tantes

 `aunts'. This system of political influence may have been used effectively to control the behavior of individual
community members, though the evidence is limited and sketchy.


From 1880 to 1940, there were some individuals who provided leadership on an 

ad hoc

 basis for individual communities, but never for the petitioner as a whole. One of the issues that brought forth leaders
was in the fight to establish separate Indian schools for the children of UHN ancestors. Because the petitioner appears
to have been composed of separate communities from 1880 to 1940, each of which may have had its own leaders, rather than
a single community with a comprehensive authority, the petitioner has not met criteria 83.7 (b) and (c) from 1880 to
1940, as a whole.


From 1940 to the present, the petitioner's members have emigrated from the lower bayou communities in greater numbers,
especially to the suburbs of New Orleans. There has also been a continuous increase in out-marriage from 1940 to the
present. Currently, two-thirds of the UHN members reside outside of the lower bayou communities. There is no evidence
that indicates a social or political relationship between those who have emigrated and those who continue to reside
in the bayou communities. There is also no evidence that the emigrants are related socially or politically among themselves.
There is some limited evidence that emigrants from specific bayou communities may maintain political and social
relations with relatives who remain in their natal bayou communities. Therefore, the petitioner has not met criteria
83.7 (b) and (c) from 1940 to the present as a whole.

The petitioner has not proven that it descends from a historical Indian tribe. In fact, there is no evidence for an antecedent
community, Indian or non-Indian, prior to 1830. Since the UHN did not exist as a community until 1830, they are not a
political community which is derived from a tribe existing at first sustained contact with Europeans until the present,
and have not existed as a distinct political community derived from such a tribe since first settlement by Europeans
in the area.

There is the possibility, though not well-documented at this time, that some or all of the component communities on
the lower bayous may meet criteria 83.7 (b) and (c) from 1880 to the present, as separate communities. But the petitioner
has not established any connection to a historical tribe prior to 1830. Nor did the petitioner submit its petition
as a confederation, but rather as a single entity. For these combined reasons, there is no need to further evaluate
the continued existence of separate communities from 1880 to the present, at this time.

There remains the possibility, however, that if the required connection is made to a historical tribe, the Assistant
Secretary may wish to investigate further the possibility of acknowledging all or several of the component communities
that comprise the UHN. This issue would only need to be investigated if the connection to a historical tribe is proven.


Since 1900, the petitioner's community has been identified consistently by anthropologists, state and Federal
government representatives, residents of south Louisiana who are not members of the petitioning group, missionaries,
journalists, and others, as ``Indian'' or by other terms which indicate at least some Indian ancestry. There is no
evidence that anyone denied that the UHN were an Indian community since 1900. They therefore meet criterion 83.7(a),
identification by outsiders as an Indian community since 1900. 

The petitioning group has provided a copy of its governing document, which describes its membership criteria. Evidence
indicates that the group is following its membership criteria satisfactorily. 

No evidence was found that any of the members of the UHN are members of any federally recognized tribe. 

No evidence was found that the petitioner or its members are the subject of congressional legislation which has expressly
terminated or forbidden the Federal relationship. 

Based on this preliminary factual determination, we conclude that the UHN does not meet criteria b, c, and e in 25 CFR
83.7. Since the UHN does not meet all of the seven mandatory criteria, we conclude that the UHN should not be granted
Federal acknowledgment under 25 CFR part 83. 

As provided by 25 CFR 83.10(h) of the revised regulations, a report summarizing the evidence, reasoning, and analyses
that are the basis for the proposed decision will be provided to the petitioner and other interested parties, and is
available to other parties upon written request. Comments on the proposed finding and/or requests for a copy of the
report of evidence should be addressed to the Office of the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian
Affairs, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, Attention: Branch of Acknowledgment and Research, Mail Stop 2611-MIB.


After consideration of the written arguments and evidence rebutting the proposed finding and within 60 days after
the expiration of the 180-day response period described above, the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs will publish
the final determination of the petitioner's status in the 

Federal Register

 as provided in 25 CFR 83.10(1).

SUMMARY:

 This NOFA announces the availability of $7.125 million to implement the second year of a demonstration program to
make grants to public and private nonprofit institutions of higher education to assist in establishing or carrying
out research and outreach activities addressing the problems of urban areas. These funds shall be used to establish
and operate Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC). 


The NOFA contains information concerning: 
(1) The principal objectives of the competition, the funding available, eligible applicants and activities and
factors for award; 
(2) The application process, including how to apply and how selections will be made; and 
(3) A checklist of application submission requirements.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and assigned
OMB control number 2535-0084. 


I. Purpose and Substantive Description 


A. Authority 


This competition is authorized under the Community Outreach Partnership Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 5307 note; hereafter
referred to as the ``COPC Act''). The COPC Act is contained in section 851 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992). Section 801(c) of the HCD Act of 1992 authorizes
$7.5 million for each year of the 5-year demonstration to create Community outreach Partnership Centers as authorized
in the COPC Act. The Act also required HUD to establish a national clearinghouse to disseminate information about
the program. 
The Community Outreach Partnership Centers program was transferred to the Office of Policy Development and Research
on August 15, 1994, as part of the Departmental reorganization which created the Office of University Partnerships.
This new Office is responsible for four of the Department's grant programs for institutions of higher education_Community
Outreach Partnership Centers program, Joint Community Development program, Community Development Work Study
program, and the Doctoral Dissertation Grant program. In addition, the Office is responsible for a variety of new
outreach initiatives to involve these institutions in local community development and revitalization partnerships.



B. Allocation and Form of Award 


The competition in this NOFA is for $7.125 million to fund the second year of the Community Outreach Partnership Centers
(COPC) Program authorized as indicated above. HUD has made $7.5 million available for the program for FY 1995. $210,000
has been taken off the top to correct a mathematical error in the funding of one of last year's grantees and $165,000
has been taken off the top to fund the clearinghouse in FY 1995. Thus, $7.125 million is available under this NOFA.

Each grant made under the COPC program will be for a maximum two year period of performance. The maximum size of any grant
will be $750,000, while the minimum will be $250,000. HUD has the authority to reduce the grant amount. Several applications
were disqualified last year because they exceeded the maximum amount. Each applicant must submit an application
within this range. Institutions of higher education which received COPC grants in FY 1994 are not eligible to receive
another COPC grant under this funding round. 


C. Description of Competition 


The Congress has mandated that the Department carry out ``a 5-year demonstration to determine the feasibility of
facilitating partnerships between institutions of higher education and communities to solve urban problems through
research, outreach and the exchange of information.'' 
The COPC Act stipulates that grants are to go to public and private institutions of higher education to establish and
operate Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC). These COPCs shall: ``(A) Conduct competent and qualified
research and investigation on theoretical or practical problems in large and small cities; and (B) Facilitate partnerships
and outreach activities between institutions of higher education, local communities, and local governments to
address urban problems.'' 
The specific problems that grants under the COPC program must focus on are ``problems associated with housing, economic
development, neighborhood revitalization, infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention,
planning, community organizing, and other areas deemed appropriate by the Secretary.'' 
Furthermore, the COPC Act states: ``The Secretary shall give preference to institutions of higher education that
undertake research and outreach activities by bringing together knowledge and expertise in the various disciplines
that relate to urban problems.'' 
Local COPC programs must combine research with outreach, work with communities and local governments and address
the multi-dimensional problems that beset urban areas. The Department is mindful that, for some institutions, such
a comprehensive approach may be beyond the current capacity of the institution. Because HUD is interested in funding
as wide a range of eligible institutions as possible, it is making a change in the focus of the program. This year applications
do not have to be comprehensive in their approach to local problems. However, while single purpose applications (e.g.,
assisting the homeless, small business development) will not be eligible, a less than comprehensive scope, addressing
three or more urban problems will be acceptable (see Selection Factor 

#

1 for the comprehensive list of urban problems that the program can cover). 
To be most effective during the term of the demonstration, the assisted research must have a clear near-term potential
for solving specific, significant urban problems. The selected institutions must have the capacity to apply their
research results and to work with communities and local institutions, including neighborhood groups, in applying
these results to specific real-life urban problems. 


D. Eligible Applicants 


Applicants for this competition must be public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education granting four
year degrees and accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education.
Consortia of institutions are eligible to apply. The Department is interested in expanding the outreach capacity
of not only colleges and universities but also junior, technical, and community colleges. While some four-year colleges
will want to apply directly for a COPC, others may not feel they have the credentials or the capacity to operate a COPC.
Two-year colleges by themselves are not eligible, but they can apply with a school offering a four-year program. But
both four-year and two-year colleges by themselves have strengths they could bring to a COPC. Thus, a selection factor
has been added to encourage the creation of such consortia. If the application is submitted on behalf of a consortium
of institutions, one institution must be designated as the legal applicant. Each institution may be part of only one
consortium or submit only one application, although the application can include various schools within the institution.

While the program focuses on ``urban'' problems, applicants do not have to be located in or assist urban areas. 


E. Program Requirements 


Grantees must meet the following program requirements: 
1. 

Responsibilities. 

In accordance with section 851(h) of the HCD Act of 1992, each COPC shall: 
``(a) Employ the research and outreach resources of its sponsoring institution of higher education to solve specific
urban problems identified by communities served by the Center; 
(b) Establish outreach activities in areas identified in the grant application as the communities to be served; 
(c) Establish a community advisory committee comprised of representatives of local institutions and residents
of the communities to be served to assist in identifying local needs and advise on the development and implementation
of strategies to address those issues; 
(d) Coordinate outreach activities in communities to be served by the Center; 
(e) Facilitate public service projects in the communities served by the Center; 
(f) Act as a clearinghouse for dissemination of information; 
(g) Develop instructional programs, convene conferences, and provide training for local community leaders, when
appropriate; and 
(h) Exchange information with other Centers.'' 
The clearinghouse function in (f) above refers to a local or regional clearinghouse for dissemination of information
and is separate and distinct from the functions in (h) above, which relate to the provision of information to the National
Clearinghouse which, as mentioned in section I.A. above will serve all funded COPCs.
2. 

Match. 

Grantees must meet the following match requirements: 
(a) 

Research Activities. 

50 percent of the total project costs of establishing and operating research activities. 
(b) 

Outreach Activities. 

25 percent of the total project costs of establishing and operating outreach activities. 
This non-Federal share may include cash or the value of non-cash contributions, equipment and other allowable in-kind
contributions as detailed in Attachment E of OMB Circular No. A-110, Grants and Agreements with Institutions
of Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Nonprofit organizations. 
Because there was confusion last year about the calculation of the match, an example is provided. 
Assume that the total project cost for a COPC was $1 million, with $250,000 for research and $750,000 for outreach.
Note that this project meets the requirement that no more than 25 percent of the total project costs be for research.
The total amount of the match required to be provided would be $312,500. The research match would be $125,000 ($250,000
X 50 percent) and the outreach match would be $187,500 ($750,000 X 25 percent). The Federal grant requested would be
$687,500 ($1 million minus the match of $312,500). In calculating the match, administrative costs should be applied
to the appropriate attributable outreach or research component. 
3. 

Administrative. 

The grant will be governed by the provision of OMB Circulars A-110 (Grants and Agreements with Institutions
of Higher Education, Hospitals and other Nonprofit Organizations), A-122 (Cost Principles for Nonprofit
Organizations), and A-133 (Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and other Nonprofit Institutions),
as implemented at 24 CFR part 45.


 F. Eligible Activities 


Eligible activities include: 
1. Research activities which have practical application for solving specific problems in designated communities
and neighborhoods. Such activities may not total more than one-quarter of the total project costs contained in any
grant made under this NOFA (including the required 50 percent match). 
2. Outreach, technical assistance and information exchange activities which are designed to address specific problems
in designated communities and neighborhoods. Such activities must total no less than three-quarters of the total
project costs contained in any grant made under this NOFA (including the required 25 percent match). 
Examples of outreach activities include, but are not limited to: 
(a) Job training and other training projects, such as workshops, seminars and one-on-one and on-the-job training;

5. Activities to carry out the ``Responsibilities'' listed under Section I.E.1. 


G. Ineligible Activities 


Ineligible activities are: 
1. Research activities which have no clear and immediate practical application for solving urban problems or do not
address specific problems in designated communities and neighborhoods. 
2. Any type of construction, rehabilitation, or other physical development costs. 
3. Costs used for day-to-day administration of regular programs of institutions of higher education, local governments
or neighborhood groups. 


II. Selection Criteria/Rating Factors 


A. Rating Factors 


As a result of a year of experience under the program, the Department has decided to streamline and revise the selection
criteria. Changes are noted in the discussion of specific factors. HUD will use the following criteria to rate and
rank applications received in response to this NOFA. The factors and maximum points for each factor are provided below.
The maximum number of points is 100. 
Rating of the ``applicant'' or the ``applicant's organization and staff'', unless otherwise specified, will include
any sub-contractors, consultants and sub-recipients which are firmly committed to the project. 
(1) (10 points) The demonstrated research and outreach resources available to the applicant for carrying out the
purposes of the COPC Act. In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's organization
and staff have recent, relevant and successful experience in:
(a) Undertaking research activities in specific communities which have clear near-term potential for practical
application to significant urban problems associated with housing, economic development, neighborhood revitalization,
infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention, planning and community organizing, and

(b) Undertaking outreach activities in specific communities to solve or ameliorate the impact of significant urban
problems. Under this factor, HUD will also evaluate the capability of the applicant to provide leadership in solving
community problems and in making national contributions to solving long-term and immediate urban problems. In the
FY 1994 competition, research and outreach resources and local and national prominence were three separate selection
factors. 
(2) (10 points) The demonstrated commitment of the applicant to supporting research and outreach programs by providing
matching contributions for the Federal assistance received. In rating this factor, HUD will provide an increasing
number of points for increasing amounts of contributions beyond the statutory 50 percent for research and 25 percent
for outreach. Maximum points will be awarded for applications that secure 50 percent more than the amount of match
required. Points will also be awarded based on the tangibility of the match, with cash and services being rated higher
than indirect contributions. 
(3) (10 points) The extent of need in the communities to be served by the applicant. HUD will consider the extent to which
the proposal clearly delineates a need or needs in the specific communities or neighborhoods (including colonias,
where appropriate), that can be resolved through the activities of a COPC. The applicant must demonstrate how these
needs were determined and how the COPC will help resolve these needs.
(4) (10 points) The demonstrated ability of the applicant to disseminate results of research and successful strategies
developed through outreach activities to other COPC and communities served through this demonstration program.
In rating this factor, HUD will evaluate the past experience of the applicant's staff and the scope and the quality
of the applicant's proposal to disseminate information on its own and other COPC research results and strategies
to: (a) local communities in its area and (b) other communities and COPC through the National Clearinghouse. 
(5) (35 points) The projects and activities that the applicant proposes to carry out under the grant. This factor has
two sub-factors: (a) effectiveness of the research strategy (10 points), and (b) effectiveness of the outreach strategy
(25 points). 
(a) In rating the effectiveness of the research strategy, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's proposal
outlines a clear research agenda related to local needs that can be successfully carried out within the period of this
grant; and 
(b) Demonstrates how the research to be undertaken will fit into the outreach strategy and activities. In rating the
effectiveness of the outreach factor, HUD will consider the extent to which: 
(i) The application identifies a clear outreach agenda related to locally-identified needs that can be successfully
carried out within the period of this grant; 
(ii) The outreach agenda includes design of a community strategy to resolve community and neighborhood problems;
and 
(iii) The outreach program provides for on-site or a frequent presence in the communities and neighborhoods to be
assisted through outreach activities. 
(6) (10 points) The extent of neighborhood and neighborhood based organization participation in the planning and
implementation of the COPC. In rating this factor, HUD will consider whether:

<DOCNO> FR941222-2-00130 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941222-2-00100 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) One or more effective community advisory committees comprised of representatives of local institutions and
a balance of racial/ethnic, gender and income mix of residents of the communities (and, where appropriate, colonias)
to be served has been or will be formed to participate in identifying local needs to be addressed by the COPC and to form
a partnership with the COPC to develop and implement strategies to address those needs; 
(b) There is a plan for involving the community advisory committee(s) in the execution of the research and outreach
agenda; and 
(c) The outreach agenda includes training projects for local community leaders, when appropriate. 
(7) (5 points) The application is submitted by a consortium composed of a variety of different kinds of post-secondary
institutions. Maximum points will be awarded to consortia composed of universities, colleges and junior, technical
or community colleges. 
(8) (10 points) The overall concept and organization of the application. In rating this factor, HUD will consider:

(a) The interrelatedness of the components of the application, such as the relationship of the research capacity
to dissemination and outreach activities; and 
(b) The likelihood that the project can be initiated and completed within the two year grant period, as measured by
such elements as sufficient staff, realistic schedules, the quality of supervision and project management, and
the likelihood that other related commitments essential to the project will be in place. 


B. Selection Process 


Applications for funding under this NOFA will be evaluated competitively and points will be awarded as specified
in the Rating Factors section described above. Applications will be reviewed by a combination of external peers and
internal reviewers. After assigning points based upon the factors all applications will be listed in rank order.
Applications will then be funded in rank order until all available funds have been expended. However, in order to be
funded, an applicant must receive a minimum score of 70. HUD reserves the right to fund all or portions of the proposed
activities identified in each application, based upon the eligibility of the proposed activities. 
If two or more applications have the same number of points, the application with the most points for rating factor (6)
shall be selected. If there is still a tie, the application with the most points for rating factor (7) shall be selected.

If the amount of funds remaining after funding as many of the highest ranking applications as possible is insufficient
for the next highest ranking application, HUD shall determine (based upon the proposed activities) if it is feasible
to fund part of the application and offer a smaller grant to the applicant. If HUD determines that given the proposed
activities a smaller grant amount would make the activities infeasible, or if the applicant turns down the reduced
grant amount, HUD shall make the same determination for the next highest ranking application until all applications
with scores of at least 70 points or available funds have been exhausted. 
If HUD receives an insufficient number of applications to exhaust all funds, or if funds remain after HUD approves
all approvable applications, HUD may negotiate increased amounts of grant awards up to an additional $250,000. Increased
grants will be offered in rank order to applicants with scores of at least 70 points. 


C. Geographic Distribution 


HUD reserves the right to make selections out of rank order to provide for a geographic distribution of funded COPCs.
The geographic balance that HUD will use, if it decides to implement this option, will be based on a combination of two
adjacent standard HUD regions (e.g., Southwest and Southeast Regions, Great Plains and Midwest Regions, etc.).
If the rank order does not yield at least one fundable COPC within each two region combination, then HUD may select the
highest ranking application from such a combination, as long as the minimum score of 70 is achieved. 
It is HUD's intent to fund at least one COPC that serves the colonias, as defined by Section 916(d) of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act, as long as the applicant receives a minimum score of 70. 


III. Application Process 


A. Obtaining Applications 


To obtain a copy of the application kit, contact: HUD USER, ATTN: COPC, P.O. Box 6091, Rockville, Maryland 20850. Requests
for application kits must be in writing, but requests may be faxed to: 301-251-5747 (this is not a toll-free
number). Requests for application kits must include the applicant's name, mailing address (including zip code),
telephone number (including area code) and must refer to ``Document FR-3825.'' HUD strongly recommends the
use of the fax transmission option to promote accuracy and expedite HUD response time. 


B. Application Deadline 


To be considered for funding, the application package must be physically received by the Office of University Partnerships,
Office of Policy Development and Research, Department of Housing and Urban Development, in care of the Division of
Budget, Contracts, and Program Control, Room 8230, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410 by 4:30 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time on February 15, 1995. The application deadline is firm as to date, hour and place. In the interest of fairness
to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received
after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials
to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems.



IV. Checklist of Application Submission Requirements 


A. Application Content 


The application kit contains instructions which must be followed in submitting an application. The following is
a checklist of the application contents that will be specified in the Request for Grant Applications (the technical
term for the application kit):

B. Certifications and Exhibits 


Applications must also include the following: 
(1) Drug-Free Workplace Certification. 
(2) Form SF-LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, if applicable. 
(3) Form HUD-2280, Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report. 


V. Corrections to Deficient Applications 


After the submission deadline date, HUD will screen each application to determine whether it is complete. If an application
lacks certain technical items or contains a technical error, such as an incorrect signatory, HUD will notify the applicant
in writing that it has 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's written notification to cure the technical deficiency.
If the applicant fails to submit the missing material within the 14-day cure period, HUD will disqualify the application.

This 14-day cure period applies only to non-substantive deficiencies or errors. Any deficiency capable of cure will
involve only items not necessary for HUD to assess the merits of an application against the factors specified in this
NOFA. 


VI. Other Matters 


Environmental Review 


In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(b) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures in this document relate only to the provision of research, training
and technical assistance which do not result in physical change and therefore are categorically excluded from the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 


Federalism Impact 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism, 

has determined that the policies and procedures contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects
on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice
is not subject to review under the Order. Specifically, the notice solicits participation in an effort to provide
assistance to institutions of higher education for establishing and carrying out research and outreach activities
addressing the problems of urban areas. The COPCs established under this notice will work with local communities
to help resolve urban problems. The notice does not impinge upon the relationships between the Federal government
and State or local governments. 


Impact on the Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family, 

has determined that this notice will likely have a beneficial impact on family formation, maintenance, and general
well-being. The assistance to be provided by the funding under this NOFA is expected to help local residents to become
self-sufficient by improving living conditions and standards. Accordingly, since the impact on the family is beneficial,
no further review is considered necessary. 


Documentation and Public Access Requirements: HUD Reform Act 


HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 


Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions 


HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the HUD Reform Act is codified at 24 CFR part 4, and applies to this funding
competition. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful
applicants. 
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815. (This is not a toll-free
number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD
employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons
outside the Department, should contact his or her Field counsel, or Headquarters counsel for the program to which
the question pertains. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel 


Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department 

and 

those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
The rule implementing section is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the
Department in these ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the regulation.

Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410-3000. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 TDD: (202)
708-1112. These are not toll-free numbers. Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from
the local HUD office. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 


The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of Section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. 


Protection of Human Subjects 


45 CFR, part 46, Subtitle A on the protection of human subjects does not apply to the COPC program because the research
activities to be conducted under the program are only incidentally regulated by the Department solely as part of it's
broader responsibility to regulate certain types of activities whether research or non-research in nature.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs (OAPP) requests applications for grants under the Adolescent Family
Life (AFL) Demonstration Projects Program. These grants are for community-based and community-supported demonstration
projects to: (1) Find effective means of preventing pregnancy by encouraging adolescents to abstain from sexual
activity through provision of age-appropriate education on sexuality and decision-making skills, and (2) establish
comprehensive and integrated approaches to the delivery of services to pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents
and their children. Funds are available for approximately 10-15 projects, which may be located in any State,
the District of Columbia, the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of Palau, Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.



 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Title XX of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300z, 

et seq., 

authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for demonstration projects to provide services
to pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents, adolescent parents and their families. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
Number 93.995) Title XX authorizes grants for three types of demonstration projects: (1) Projects which provide
``care services'' only (

i.e., 

services for the provision of care to pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents and their families); (2) projects
which provide ``prevention services'' only (

i.e., 

services to prevent adolescent sexual relations); and (3) projects which provide a combination of care and prevention
services. 



The Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs (OAPP) intends to make available approximately $4.5 million to support
an estimated 10-15 new demonstration projects. An applicant may submit a proposal for a 

local 

care, prevention or combination care/prevention project 

or 

for a 

national multi-site 

prevention project with at least two sites in different States. The awards for care projects will range from $200,000
to $400,000. The awards for local prevention projects will range from $150,000 to $250,000. Funding for national
multi-site prevention projects and for combination care/prevention projects may be higher, in proportion to the
effort proposed. 

These grants will be awarded for a period of one year, and the availability of funding for later years is uncertain.
Therefore, we encourage applications from experienced organizations which are currently operating programs and
which have the capability of expanding and enhancing these services to serve significant numbers of adolescents
according to the guidelines specified in this announcement. 

Additional funds may be available in Fiscal Year 1996 and following years. If funds do become available, grantees
funded under this program announcement will be eligible to reapply for continued funding. 

Grants are funded in annual increments (budget periods). Funding for all approved budget periods beyond the first
year of a grant is contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the project, and adequate stewardship
of Federal funds. A grant award may not exceed 70 percent of the total cost of the project for the first year. The non-Federal
share of the project costs may be provided in cash expenditures or fairly evaluated in-kind contributions, including
plant, equipment and services.

The specific services which may be funded under Title XX are listed below under Care Programs and Prevention Programs.
Applicants who propose to provide a Combination of Care and Prevention Services Program must meet the requirements
for each type of program.

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This announcement is related to the
priority area of Family Planning. A midcourse review of the objectives is presently ongoing, and the proposed revisions
are contained in a draft. A notice of Availability and Request for Comment on the Healthy People 2000 Midcourse Revisions
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 3, 1994 (59 FR 50253). Requests for copies of the 

Draft for Public Review and Comment: Healthy People 2000 Midcourse Revisions

 can be faxed to (301) 594-5980 or mailed to: OAPP/OPA, East-West Towers, Suite 200, West Building, 5600 Fishers
Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. A new PHS report, 

Healthy People 2000 Midcourse Review and Revisions, 

featuring the final revisions and a status report on progress in achieving targets for the year 2000, will be published
in 1995.

The following application requirements contain information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-511). These information collections have been approved by OMB under control
number 0937-0189.



Eligible Applicants



Any public or private nonprofit organization or agency is eligible to apply for a grant. Grants are awarded only to
those organizations or agencies which are determined to demonstrate the capability of providing the proposed services
and meet the statutory requirements.


Care Programs



Under this announcement, funds are available for local care demonstrations only and not for multi-site national
projects. The project site must be identified in the application rather than selected after the grant is awarded.

Under the statute the purpose of care programs is to establish innovative, comprehensive, and integrated approaches
to the delivery of care services for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents under 19 years of age at program entry,
with primary emphasis on unmarried adolescents who are 17 years old or younger and for their families. This includes
young fathers and their families.



The OAPP encourages the submission of care applications which propose to do the following: (1) Add care services to
supplement existing adolescent health services in school, hospital or other community settings, (2) provide care
services to minority or other disadvantaged populations, (3) continue services to clients after the delivery of
the baby to enable them to acquire good parenting skills and to ensure that their children are developing normally
physically, intellectually and emotionally, (4) stress self-sufficiency skills, such as school completion (in
mainstream or alternative schools and GED programs) and/or job training preparation and placement, and (5) involve
males and promote male responsibility. Applicants should base their approaches upon an assessment of existing programs
and, where appropriate, upon efforts to establish better coordination, integration and linkages among such existing
programs.

Applicants for care projects are required to provide, either directly or by referral, the following 10 core services:

(1) Pregnancy testing and maternity counseling;
(2) Adoption counseling and referral services which present adoption as an option for pregnant adolescents, including
referral to licensed adoption agencies in the community if the eligible grant recipient is not a licensed adoption
agency;

(3) Primary and preventive health services, including prenatal and postnatal care;

(4) Nutrition information and counseling;

(5) Referral for screening and treatment of venereal disease;

(6) Referral to appropriate pediatric care;

(7) Educational services relating to family life and problems associated with adolescent premarital sexual relations
including:

(a) Information about adoption,

(b) Education on the responsibilities of sexuality and parenting,

(c) The development of material to support the role of parents as the providers of sex education, and

(d) Assistance to parents, schools, youth agencies and health providers to educate adolescents and preadolescents
concerning self-discipline and responsibility in human sexuality;

(8) Appropriate educational and vocational services;

(9) Mental health services and referral to mental health services and to other appropriate physical health services;

(10) Counseling and referral for family planning services.






Note:

 Funds provided under Title XX may not be used for the provision of family planning services other than counseling and
referral services unless appropriate family planning services are not otherwise available in the community. In
accordance with sec. 2006(a)(17) o
