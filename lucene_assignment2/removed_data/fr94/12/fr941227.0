OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT














Employment (General)








<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is amending its regulations to reflect that agency heads must ensure that
employees and applicants for employment at their agencies are notified of the provisions in the Hatch Act Reform Amendments
of 1993, which prohibit individuals from requesting, making, transmitting, accepting, or considering political
recommendations in effecting personnel actions.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 8 of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. 103-94, amended section 3303 of title 5, United States
Code, to expand and strengthen the prohibition against political recommendations in examinations and appointments.
Although section 3303 was limited to prohibiting political recommendations in connection with examinations for,
or appointments to, positions in the competitive service, the amended section 3303 includes other personnel actions
as well. It defines ``personnel action'' as any action described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(A)(i)-(ix), including
appointments, promotions, disciplinary or corrective actions, details, transfers, reassignments, reinstatements,
restorations, reemployments, performance evaluations, and decisions concerning pay, benefits, or awards.




The amended section 3303 provides for OPM to issue regulations requiring agency heads to ensure that employees and
applicants are notified of its provisions. On February 22, 1994, OPM issued its proposal to amend 5 CFR part 300 by adding
a new subpart H which would require agency heads to ensure that applicants and employees are notified of the provisions
of 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended. OPM's proposal also listed strategies for issuing notifications, but noted that the
list is not exclusive and gives agency officials the discretion to consider and implement other means of notification.






OPM received comments from three Federal agencies and one Federal employee organization about the proposed regulations.
One Federal agency commented that placing additional administrative requirements on Federal agencies appears
to be inconsistent with the intent of the National Performance Review recommendations to streamline the Federal
government and reduce funding, spending, and reporting requirements. The agency suggested that OPM explore other
alternatives for complying with the Reform Amendments, such as issuing instructions to agencies to disregard political
recommendations received incident to personnel actions and to notify the alleged offenders accordingly.





The amended 5 U.S.C. 3303 provides that ``[u]nder regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management,
the head of each agency shall ensure that employees and applicants are given notice of the provisions of this section.''
Section 3303, as amended, clearly contemplates that OPM shall issue the specified regulations; it does not give OPM
any discretion to select an alternate method of requiring agency heads to notify employees and applicants of the prohibition
against soliciting, making, receiving, or accepting political recommendations. Therefore, OPM cannot adopt the
suggestion to explore other alternatives for complying with the regulatory mandate in 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended.
Moreover, OPM's regulations are consistent with the spirit and intent of the National Performance Review recommendations.
In recognition of these recommendations, OPM has left to each agency head the discretion to select the methods of notification
which most suit the needs of his or her own agency.


Subsection (h) of the amended section 3303 specifically provides that the prohibition recommendations does not
affect the right of an employee under 5 U.S.C. 7211 to petition Congress. A second Federal agency suggested that OPM
provide examples in its regulations to show what would be included or excluded under the statutory right to petition
Congress. OPM has already provided agencies with written guidance on the amended section 3303, and will provide further
guidance should the need arise. Therefore, OPM believes it is not necessary to include such examples in its regulations.



The third Federal agency suggested that OPM note in its regulations that subsection (f)(2) of the amended section
3303 permits recommendations which are based solely on the character of an employee or applicant. OPM does not believe
that it is necessary to include this provision in its regulations because the provision already is stated in the controlling
statute. The agency further suggested that, in section 300.801 of the regulation, OPM replace the word ``effecting''
with ``affecting.'' OPM intended that  300.801 would relate to ``effecting'' or bringing about personnel
actions, rather than to ``affecting'' or influencing such actions. Therefore, OPM does not intend to revise the proposed
 300.801 in the manner suggested.




Finally, one Federal employee organization commented that OPM's regulatory proposal is fully supported by the applicable
provisions of law.

Section 3303, as amended, specifically authorizes OPM to promulgate regulations requiring agency heads to ensure
that employees and applicants receive notice of its provisions. Therefore, OPM is amending Part 300 by adding a new
Subpart H-Notification Requirements Relating to the Statutory Prohibitions on Political Recommendations
in Personnel Actions. Section 300.801 of the new Subpart H states that agency heads must ensure that applicants and
employees are notified of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended. Section 300.802 lists strategies for issuing
notifications, but also specifies that the list is not exclusive and gives agency officials the discretion to consider
and implement other means of notification.

Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance and Federal Employees Health Benefits Programs; Reconsideration of Employing
Office Enrollment Decisions





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.









</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to improve the administrative process used
by the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) and Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Programs in
resolving disputes between Federal employees and agencies over coverage and enrollment issues. The purpose of these
regulations is to improve the performance of the Government by delegating to Federal agencies the authority to reconsider
disputes over coverage and enrollment issues in these two programs and to make retroactive as well as prospective
corrections of errors.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 17, 1994, OPM published proposed regulations (59 FR 31171) that would delegate to agencies the authority to
make final reconsideration decisions on enrollment issues under the FEGLI and FEHB Programs and to make retroactive
as well as prospective corrections where appropriate.



OPM received comments from nine agency headquarters or installations, one employee organization, and one health
insurance carrier. Three commenters expressed their approval of the proposed regulations without further comment.
The other eight commenters expressed various concerns about the changes made by the proposed regulations and about
the procedures they would have to develop in order to comply with them. Generally, the comments reflected considerable
confusion on the part of agencies as to exactly what they would be required to do under these proposed regulations.

Four commenters expressed the belief that the statistics provided in the supplementary information do not support
the delegation of the reconsideration decision to agencies because they represent errors on the part of agencies.
These statistics showed that about one-third of the cases OPM received involved decisions about retroactive changes,
which agencies cannot make under current regulations. Therefore, these do not represent errors on the part of agencies.
An additional 23 percent of the requests OPM received were returned to the agencies because the employees had not followed
administrative procedures_in most cases employees had not asked their agencies for an initial decision. These,
also, do not represent agency errors. Because some cases involved both an enrollment issue and a retroactive coverage
issue, the percentages do not show the exact number of cases where agency error may have been involved. However, in
more than half the cases, agency error was not involved. Considering the tremendous volume of enrollment decisions
that employing offices make each year, the fact that so few decisions are disputed by employees reflects a remarkable
achievement by employing offices.

Three commenters were uncertain about what ``administrative error'' means. Generally, an administrative error
occurs when an employing office misapplies the law or regulations, misinforms employees, or fails to inform employees
when required to do so. It could include any mistake on the part of the employing office that directly results in the
loss of a benefit or opportunity to an employee. We have not incorporated a definition into the regulations because
doing so would tend to narrow the application of the term. One of the commenters asked that we clarify the difference
between ``administrative error'' in   870.102(a) and 890.103(a) and ``error'' in   870.102(b)
and 890.103(b). There is no difference; therefore, we are changing the regulations to read ``administrative error''
in each case.


Three commenters questioned OPM's ``equity and good conscience'' authority and asked if they must give an appeal
right to OPM when they issue a reconsideration decision. OPM's ``equity and good conscience authority,'' which allows
us to order the correction of an administrative error, is not a part of the administrative review process. The administrative
review process ends with the agency's reconsideration decision. However, without the authority to order a correction,
OPM could not overrule an agency reconsideration decision that is obviously in disregard of law and regulations and
is unfair to the employee. While these situations are rare, OPM must retain the authority to correct them. OPM will
issue guidance to agencies to help them in developing procedures for making reconsideration decisions.

One commenter believes that, although delegation will reduce costs to OPM, it will increase them for the agencies.
Based on the relatively small number of reconsideration decisions that OPM issues each year for the entire Government,
it is unlikely that any agency will have a large enough volume of reconsideration requests to affect costs. However,
if an agency should find that it is getting an unusually large number of reconsideration requests, it may find that
the procedures or training it is giving to personnel staff in its installations need to be reviewed and strengthened.

One commenter requested that OPM issue procedures regarding the review of agency actions when heirs contest the life
insurance coverage of a deceased employee. This kind of dispute is a claims issue rather than an enrollment issue.
Life insurance claims are handled by the Office of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (OFEGLI). If it appears
that enrollment issues are involved OFEGLI normally contacts OPM for help in resolving the matter. Since this kind
of dispute must be resolved on a case-by-case basis, detailed procedures for agencies are inappropriate.

One commenter suggested that OPM give agencies more flexibility in the enrollment and change in enrollment rules.
OPM is currently developing regulations that would bring much greater flexibility to the rules for enrolling in FEHB
plans and for changing FEHB enrollments. We expect to issue these as proposed regulations within the next few months.

One commenter asked how these regulations would apply to decisions on FEGLI and FEHB issues previously handled solely
by the agency or the retirement system (for example, whether an employee meets the requirements for continuing coverage
into retirement, whether a spouse meets the eligibility requirements for present or future benefits from the retirement
system, or whether an individual meets the requirements for FEHB coverage as a hostage under Public Law 101-513).
These regulations affect only reconsideration decisions that were previously made by OPM under  870.205 and
 890.104, which will now be made by the employing agencies (or retirement system, if appropriate) rather than
OPM. Agency and retirement system decisions made under other provisions are unaffected by these regulations.

One commenter asserted that, since OPM has the statutory authority to administer both of these programs and to enter
into contracts with carriers, these regulations constitute an abrogation of OPM's authority as plan sponsor. OPM
disagrees. Both the FEGLI and the FEHB laws are structured so that agencies perform the day-to-day functions necessary
to handle their employees' enrollments and enrollment changes. Although OPM has performed the reconsideration
function in the past, the law does not prohibit the delegation of this function to agencies.

Two commenters expresses the concern that employees would not have their cases reviewed outside the agency. One of
these felt that, since FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not appealable to the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB), OPM
should review these cases because it is responsible for the policies on which they are based. The other felt that OPM
has the expertise necessary to resolve enrollment disputes that agencies lack, and that no change should be made unless
chapter 71 of title 5, U.S. Code, is amended to allow employees to grieve agency decisions on FEGLI and FEHB enrollment
issues. It is true that FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not subject to review by the Merit Systems Protection Board nor
may they be grieved under chapter 71 of title 5, U.S. Code. We believe that, for the most part, agencies already have
the expertise necessary to make these decisions and that a level of administrative review that is independent of the
agency is unnecessary. OPM will provide guidance and other assistance to agencies in setting up procedures for making
reconsideration decisions.

One commenter suggested that we set a time limit on the length of the retroactive period that agencies may authorize.
We do not believe that setting an arbitrary time limit would be appropriate. A retroactive correction must be based
on an administrative error and the employee must request a retroactive correction. The agency must consider each
case on its own merits. Most requests for retroactive correction are for FEHB enrollment issues. Generally, these
are self-limiting in terms of the length of the retroactive period because carriers generally require that claims
be made no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the one in which the medical service was provided. However,
we recognize that agencies do not have experience in granting retroactive corrections; therefore, we are modifying
the FEHB regulations so that they apply only to retroactive corrections of administrative errors that occur after
December 31, 1994.

One commenter requested that OPM provide guidance to help them develop procedures and allow sufficient lead time
for them to do this. OPM will provide guidance to help agencies set up procedures; however, agencies will find that
the reconsideration function is not difficult. They have been making the initial decisions on prospective corrections
for many years, and reconsideration decisions are similar. We do not believe that a lengthy delay is necessary with
regard to prospective corrections. The modification we are making in the regulation to limit retroactive corrections
of administrative errors occurring after December 31, 1994, will have a delaying effect on decisions regarding retroactive
corrections.

One commenter suggested that we change the proposed regulations at 5 CFR 870.102 to read ``The employing office may
make 

prospective and retroactive

 corrections * * *'' to conform to the language in 5 CFR 890.103. The difference in language is intentional.
Under current regulations, an agency's failure to withhold Basic Life insurance premiums is always corrected retroactively
because coverage is automatic unless the employee submits a waiver. Similarly, an agency's failure to process a waiver
on a timely basis is retroactive to the effective date of the waiver. Since agencies are not free to make a judgment as
to whether the change should be retroactive in these cases, it is not appropriate for the regulations to imply that
they do. However, the language of the FEGLI regulations does not preclude either prospective or retroactive changes
that do not conflict with the law or regulations. In the case of FEHB enrollments, the agency is generally free to make
a judgment as to whether a prospective or retroactive change is appropriate.

One commenter suggested that we clarify whether OPM's decision to order a retroactive correction is subject to retroactive
payment of premiums under   870.102 and 890.103. Since retroactive payment of premiums is required under
the law, it has been OPM's practice to include the requirement for payment of retroactive premiums in its letters to
the agencies ordering the retroactive correction. However, we are modifying the regulations to make it clear that
the requirement for payment of retroactive premiums applies regardless of who authorizes the retroactive correction.

One commenter suggested that we change the requirements for the information that must be included in an employee's
request for reconsideration to include a copy of the initial decision. We have intentionally not included a copy of
the initial decision as a regulatory requirement. This information should be given in the initial decision itself;
however, we do not agree that the copy of the initial decision need be included for the request to be considered timely
under the regulations. If the request includes sufficient information to identify the individual, it can be accepted
as a timely request and the initial decision can be requested if it is not included.

One commenter suggested that   870.103(c)(2) and 890.104(c)(2) be changed to specify that the reconsideration
review is an independent level of review. We are making this modification in the interest of clarity.
One commenter asked how these regulations apply to agencies that have previously delegated initial decisions to
another agency through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Such agencies may need to amend the MOU's to show which
agency is to make the reconsideration decision. Currently the initial decision letters have been directing employees
to ask OPM to reconsider the initial decision. Under the revised regulations the initial decision must tell the employee
how to seek reconsideration.
One commenter expressed the concern that the term ``agency'' used in  890.104 could restrict the agency's options
about the role of the National Finance Center (NFC) in the reconsideration process for those agencies that have a MOU
with NFC to administer their payroll or FEHB accounts for enrollees who make direct premium payments. Since NFC acts
as an agent for the agency, these regulations in no way restrict NFC's role. However, agencies and NFC will need to decide
which will perform the reconsideration function and then modify the MOU accordingly.
In general, the comments we received indicated that agencies are uncertain about what reconsideration actually
is. Therefore, we are adding a definition of the term ``reconsideration'' to clarify that it is the final part of the
administrative review process and consists of a determination of whether the law and regulations were correctly
applied when the initial decision was made.
In addition, there were several suggestions to correct real or perceived technical or typographical errors in the
proposed regulations. We have made changes where appropriate.

Accordingly, OPM is amending 5 CFR parts 870, 871, 872, 873, 874, and 890 as follows:



PART 870_FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE PROGRAM



1. The authority citation for part 870 continues to read as follows:








Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 8716;  870.202(c) also issued under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2); subpart J is also issued under section 599C
of Pub. L. 101-513, 104 Stat. 2064, as amended.






2. In subpart A,  870.102 is revised,  870.103 is redesignated as  870.104, a new  870.103
is added, and newly redesignated  870.104 is amended by revising the introductory text of the definition of


Employing office, 

adding paragraph (d) to the definition of 

Employing office 

and by adding a definition of 

Reconsideration 

to read as follows:



 870.102 

Correction of errors.



(a) The employing office may make corrections of administrative errors as to coverage or changes in coverage at any
time.

(b) OPM may order correction of an administrative error upon a showing satisfactory to OPM that it would be against
equity and good conscience not to do so.

(b) Retroactive corrections of coverage are subject to the provisions of  870.401(h).



 870.103 

Initial decision and reconsideration.



(a) 

Who may file. 

(1) An employee may request his or her agency to reconsider an employing office's initial decision denying insurance
coverage or the opportunity to change coverage.

(2) An annuitant may request his or her retirement system to reconsider its initial decision affecting insurance
coverage.

(3) A judge may request his or her agency, or retirement system if applicable, to reconsider an employing office's
initial decision that denies an entitlement related to assignments under 5 U.S.C. 8706(e) of this chapter.

(b) 

Initial employing office decision. 

An employing office's decision is considered an initial decision as used in paragraph (a) of this section when rendered
by the employing office in writing and stating the right to an independent level of review (reconsideration) by the
appropriate agency or retirement system. However, an initial decision rendered at the highest level of review available
within OPM is not subject to reconsideration.

(c) 

Reconsideration. 

(1) A request for reconsideration must be made in writing, must include the claimant's name, address, date of birth,
Social Security number, reason(s) for the request, and, if applicable, retirement claim number.

(2) The reconsideration review must be an independent level of review made at or above the level at which the initial
decision was rendered.

(d) 

Time limit. 

A request for reconsideration of an initial decision must be filed within 30 calendar days from the date of the written
decision stating the right to a reconsideration. The time limit on filing may be extended when the individual shows
that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances
beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit. An agency or retirement system decision in
response to a request for reconsideration of an employing office's decision is a final decision as described in paragraph
(e) of this section.

(e) 

Final decision. 

After reconsideration, the agency or retirement system must issue a final decision, which must be in writing and must
fully set forth the findings and conclusions.



 870.104 

Definitions.



* * * * *





Employing office 

means the office of the agency or retirement system to which jurisdiction and responsibility for life insurance actions
have been delegated.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) hereby amend the regulations originally published
by the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) and by the RTB. These amendments revise nomenclature in order
to implement recent legislation directing the Secretary of Agriculture to establish the Rural Utilities Service
(RUS), with responsibility for the electric and telephone loan programs formerly administered by REA, including
loan programs of the RTB. Nomenclature changes to regulations affecting other programs administered by RUS, including
water and waste facility loan and grant programs and certain other programs previously administered by the former
Rural Development Administration and the former Farmers Home Administration will be published separately. The
amendments published in this document consist solely of nomenclature changes required by law and of amendments necessary
to conform to these nomenclature changes. The substance of the regulations is not affected by these amendments. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-354,
108 Stat. 3178) (Reorganization Act) signed by President Clinton on October 13, 1994, provides for a streamlining
and reorganizing of the Department of Agriculture (Department). The Reorganization Act requires the Secretary
of Agriculture (Secretary) to establish the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) within the Department. On October 20,
1994, the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary), in Secretary's Memorandum 1010-1, abolished the Rural Electrification
Administration (REA) and established RUS, as required by the Reorganization Act. 

The functions of RUS include, among other things, administration of the electric and telephone loan programs authorized
by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901 

et seq.

) (RE Act) and of the water and waste facility loan and grant programs authorized by various laws. The rights, interests,
obligations, duties, and assets of REA have been vested in and transferred to RUS. 

In order to enhance the delivery of customer services, provide continuity of service, and minimize public confusion
about the administration and functions of the newly established agency, RUS is amending regulations originally
published by REA and by the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) to replace references to REA and its officials with references
to RUS and to officials of the newly established agency. A few definitions are being revised to conform with the new
nomenclature. Additional regulations implementing other aspects of the reorganization of the Department of Agriculture
will be published at a later date. 

Since this action relates solely to agency organization, procedure, or practice, notice and comment is not required
prior to publication of this final rule. This final rule is published in accordance with the Reorganization Act.

In order to provide continuity of references, facilitate the orderly transfer of functions from REA to RUS, and ensure
the timely execution of RUS functions, this rule is effective immediately. 

Accordingly, under the authority of the Under Secretary for Rural Economic and Community Development, title 7 of
the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:

24. Section 1700.1 is revised to read as follows: 


 1700.1 

General. 


(a) The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was established by Executive Order No. 7037, signed by the President
on May 11, 1935. Statutory authority was provided by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act) (49 Stat. 1363;
7 U.S.C. 901). The RE Act established REA as a lending agency with responsibility for developing a program for rural
electrification. 
(b) On October 28, 1949, an amendment to the RE Act authorized REA to make loans to improve and extend telephone service
in rural areas. The Rural Telephone Bank (RTB or the Bank), an Agency of the United States, was established by another
amendment to the RE Act, approved May 7, 1971. The Administrator of RUS serves as the Bank's chief executive with the
title of Governor. On May 11, 1973, the RE Act was further amended to establish a revolving fund and to provide authority
for REA to guarantee loans made by other legally organized lenders. The RE Act was amended further on December 21, 1987,
to establish a Rural Economic Development Subaccount, and to authorize funds from this subaccount to provide zero-interest
loans and grants to REA borrowers to promote rural economic development and job creation. The RE Act was also amended
on November 5, 1990, to add a new section 314, which authorized REA to guarantee 90 percent of the principal and interest
of loans made for electric and telephone facilities by legally organized lenders. It was further amended on November
28, 1990, to establish an Assistant Administrator for Economic Development and a rural development technical assistance
unit; to expand the authorities and responsibilities of REA in rural economic development; and to establish a Rural
Business Incubator Fund for making grants and reduced interest loans to electric and telephone borrowers to promote
business incubator projects. At the same time, the Administrator was also granted authority for financial assistance
for distance learning and medical link programs. 
(c) The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) was required to establish the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) pursuant
to section 232 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, (Pub.
L. 103-354, 108 Stat. 3178) (Reorganization Act). The Reorganization Act established RUS as successor to REA.
On October 20, 1994, the Secretary abolished REA and established RUS. RUS was assigned responsibility for administering
electric and telephone loan programs previously administered by REA, water and waste facility loans and grants previously
administered by the Rural Development Administration, along with other functions as the Secretary determines appropriate.
The rights, interests, obligations, duties, and contracts previously vested in REA are transferred to and vested
in RUS. The Secretary designated the Administrator of RUS to serve as the Governor of RTB. 
(d) The offices of RUS are located in the South Building of the United States Department of Agriculture at 14th and Independence
Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250-1500. The Electric and Telephone Programs are administered by regional
offices located at this same address. There is a Northern and a Southern Regional Office, along with a Power Supply
Division, for the electric program, and an Eastern and a Western Regional Office for the telephone program. (See  1700.4(b)
and  1700.5(b).)

Service, and Consolidated Farm Service Agency, USDA. 



<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Consolidated Farm Service Agency (CFSA) is the successor to the Farmers Home Administration pursuant to Section
226 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. Law 103-354, 108 stat. 3178, October 13, 1994). The
CFSA is establishing a regulation whereby under the procedures of the Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical
Assistance Program and the Outreach and Assistance Grants for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program,
an 1890 Land Grant Institution or other eligible educational institution or community-based organization could
enter into a cooperative or other agreement with CFSA to provide outreach, training, and technical assistance to
small-scale farmers, especially members of socially disadvantaged groups. This action is necessary to implement
the provisions in the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, title XXV, Section 2501 and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) appropriation acts which provide funding for this program. The intended effect
of this action is to assist small farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers by making them aware of programs
available through the USDA. In addition, this rule amends 7 CFR chapter XVIII to reflect the abolishment of the Farmers
Home Administration and the Rural Development Administration and the establishment of the Rural Housing and Community
Development Service, the Rural Business and Cooperative Development Service, the Rural Utilities Service, and
the Consolidated Farm Service Agency in the recent Department of Agriculture reorganization.

Background 


In July 1993, Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) initiated, under Section 2501 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation,
and Trade Act of 1990, the Outreach and Assistance Grants for Socially Disadvantage Farmers and Ranchers program.
The program was established by an internal funds transfer, in the amount of $1 million received on August 13, 1993,
from Extension Service. 
A Notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 2, 1993, [58 FR 35911-35914], Outreach and Assistance Grants for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and
Ranchers, and no adverse comments were received. The Notice was to solicit recipients and give guidance to eligible
applicants on submitting proposals for the program. 


Discussion of Interim Rule 


Outreach and Assistance Grants for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers is authorized under Section 2501
of the Food Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 2279). Three million dollars will remain available
until expended. It was the intent of Congress to have funds available to provide outreach and technical assistance
to encourage and assist socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to own and operate farms and ranches and to participate
in agricultural programs. This assistance should enable socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to obtain
information on application and bidding procedures, farm management, and other essential information to participate
in agricultural programs. 
The definition of Agricultural programs contained in 1943.104 of this subpart is based on the programs authorized
by the statutes referenced in Section 2501 (e)(3) of the FACT Act. As authorized by Section 2501 (e)(3)(G), FmHA has
designated additional USDA programs as Agricultural program based on its belief that the participation of socially
disadvantaged farmers and ranchers in these programs will serve an important public purpose. The definition of Agricultural
program references many of USDA's programs, however, the list is not intended to be all inclusive. Rather, the regulation
intends to increase participation by socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers in all USDA programs which are
agricultural in nature. However, because the program is carried out by CFSA employees, the outreach efforts by CFSA
personnel to recipients will require the personnel to provide information about CFSA agricultural loans only until
such time as information on the other USDA agricultural programs becomes available. 


Need for the Interim Rule: 


 To implement, this year, a program that directly addresses the decline of minority farmers and ranchers. 
 To immediately put into effect what is a clear and pressing goal of the Administration. On November 1, 1993,
President Clinton issued Executive Order 12876, that directs the Government to support Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCU's) and to provide opportunities to participate in and benefit from federal programs. These
institutions are a major beneficiary of this funding. 
 In addition, under Section 2501, Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers,
non-HBCU's entities, 

i.e., 

Indian Tribal community colleges and Hispanic serving post-secondary educational institutions will be in the population
served. 
 To allow funds to be used in FY 95 that will provide assistance in advance of planting and building for the upcoming
crop year. 
 The application of this program will help in development of the components in the '95 Farm Bill aimed at stabilizing
socially disadvantaged family farmers. 
 As services are consolidated and agencies change as a result of reorganization of USDA, the socially disadvantaged
population, whom these funds are targeted at, will be able to receive the necessary assistance to understand and gain
access to the newly reorganized USDA.




It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts
will be published for comment not withstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553. However, the Department is publishing
this rule as an interim rule which will take effect immediately upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 without securing prior public comment. 
The Agency is taking this action because the funds which will be distributed in the fiscal year 1995 are not being distributed
under a typically new action or proposal which will affect the public. Rather the funds will go to organizations whose
five years' plans were selected for funding pursuant to the July 2, 1993, Notice so that the organizations can continue
to provide information and assistance to socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. Moreover, since that Notice
provided the criteria for obtaining funding, the organizations which are affected by this action (which contains
similar requirements) have actual notice of the applicable standards.

Organizations whose proposals were not selected for funding in 1993 and organizations submitting new proposals
are not immediately affected by this action because they will not receive funding in this fiscal year. Also, these
organizations will have the opportunity to comment on the interim rule because their comments will be considered
before any truly new money could be distributed in the fiscal year 1996. Only $3,000,000 was appropriated for this
program for the fiscal year 1994, and $2,995,000 for the fiscal year 1995. The same amount may not be appropriated in
subsequent years. However, it is the Agency's expectation that funds will be appropriated for this program either
as a separate item or as part of the general appropriations for the Agency in the future years. Therefore, the interim
rule establishes guidelines for administering the program for future years. 


Program Description 


1. The regulation being developed embodies the content of the original notice, published on July 2, 1993. The interested
parties are fully aware of the procedures and standards intended for this program. 
2. The program's objective is to reverse, through the use of the Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Program,
the decline of socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers across the United States.



 This outcome will be reached by encouraging and assisting socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to
own and operate their own farms, participate in agricultural programs, and become an integral part of the agricultural
community. 
 The recipients of these grants will provide services to socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers and small
farmers through outreach training and technical assistance in farm and ranch management, recordkeeping, marketing
techniques and in testing innovative solutions to existing or anticipated issues or problems they may encounter.



Under the interim rule, CFSA will solicit proposals, and five-year plans to be funded on a competitive basis. The solicitation
is encouraged from community-based organizations, 1890 Land Grant colleges, including Tuskegee University, Indian
Tribal Community Colleges and Alaska Native cooperative colleges, Hispanic serving post-secondary educational
institutions, and other post-secondary educational institutions with demonstrated experience in providing agriculture
education or other agricultural related services to socially disadvantaged family farmers and ranchers in their
region. 
The proposals will be evaluated by a panel of Agency technical experts to determine which proposals are most meritorious.
The panel of Agency technical experts are necessary to evaluate what is expected to be a variety of very technical proposals.
The evaluation panel will make recommendations to the appropriate Agency official to be forwarded to the Agency Head,
who will consult with, if necessary, the Secretary of USDA before a final decision on awarding the grants or cooperative
agreements is made. 
To assure a consistency in the evaluation process the interim rule establishes a set of evaluation criteria to assure
the proposal is consistent with the intent of the program and is worth the funds that are to be spent on the project. 
The accounting for the funds awarded for the cooperative or other agreement will be subject to the normal rules for
such agreements within USDA as given in part 3016 of this title. The proposed application format is used to assure that
sufficient information is obtained to complete an agreement as given in part 3016 of this title. In addition, the application
format is similar to that used by other USDA Agencies for their competitive grants programs.

Standards of conduct for employees of recipient. 




(a) Recipients must establish safeguards to prevent employees, consultants, or members of governing bodies from
using their positions for purposes that are, or give the appearance of being, motivated by a desire for private financial
gain for themselves or others such as those with whom they have family, business, or other ties. Therefore, recipients
receiving financial support must have written policy guidelines on conflict of interest and the avoidance thereof.
These guidelines should reflect State and local laws and must cover financial interests, gifts, gratuities and favors,
nepotism, and other areas such as political participation and bribery. These rules must also indicate the conditions
under which outside activities, relationships, or financial interests are proper or improper, and provide for notification
of these kinds of activities, relationships, or financial interests to a responsible and objective recipient official.
For the requirements of a code of conduct applicable to procurements under grants and cooperative agreements, see
the procurement standards prescribed by 7 CFR 3015.181. 


(b) The rules of conduct must contain a provision for prompt notification of violations to a responsible and objective
recipient official and must specify the type of administrative action that may be taken against an individual for
violations. 


(c) A copy of the rules of conduct must be given to each officer, employee, board member, and consultant of the recipient
who is working on the CFSA financed project, and the rules must be enforced to the extent permissible under State and
local law or to the extent to which the recipient determines it has legal and practical enforcement capacity. The rules
need not be formally submitted and approved by the awarding official; however, they must be made available for review
upon request, for example, during a site visit. 


 1943.137 

Monitoring compliance and penalty for noncompliance. 




(a) 

CFSA monitoring. 

CFSA will monitor compliance of the Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance projects through the
reports received in accordance with  1943.128 of this subpart, through information received from field offices
and the public, and may include on-site visits to observe the operation and administration of the program. 


(b) 

Audits. 

Recipients are subject to the audit requirements of 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016. An audit report will be submitted to the
State Office annually in accordance with OMB Circular A-128, A-110, or A-133, whichever is applicable.
The State Office will forward the audit to the National Office Project Manager, within 30 days after receipt, with
the State Office's comments and recommendations. 


(c) 

Penalty for noncompliance. 

If the Administrator determines that a Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance project does not
meet or no longer meets the objective of the program, that there has been a violation of the cooperative or other agreement,
that reporting requirements are not being met, or that funds are not being used only for the operation and administration
of the Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Program, the awarding official is authorized to impose
any penalties or sanctions established in 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016. Penalties may include withholding payments,
suspension of the cooperative agreement or other agreement, or termination for cause. If a penalty for noncompliance
is enforced, the reason(s) will be stated in a letter to the recipient along with appeal rights pursuant to subpart
B of part 1900 of this chapter.

Reduction of Accreditation Fees for FSIS Accredited Laboratories



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending provisions of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations to reduce the fees charged participants in the Agency's Accredited Laboratory Program (ALP). Non-Federal
analytical laboratories are qualified under the ALP to conduct analyses of official meat and poultry samples. Laboratory
accreditation fees that cover the costs of the ALP are mandated by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade
Act of 1990 (the 1990 Farm Bill), as amended. The same Act mandates annual payment of the fees on the anniversary date
of each accreditation. FSIS has determined that reduced ALP administrative expenditures for fiscal year 1995 will
enable the Agency to charge a smaller accreditation fee than last year. However, because the laboratory accreditation
fee is set forth in the regulations, the regulations must be changed before the Agency can charge a different fee. Since
the anniversary date of most current accreditations is December 13, FSIS would like to begin billing the laboratories
at the reduced rate on that date. FSIS is also making an editorial correction to the Federal meat and poultry products
inspection regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit comments concerning this interim rule. Written comments should be sent
in triplicate to the Policy, Evaluation and Planning Staff and should refer to docket number 94-033I. Any person
desiring opportunity for oral presentation of views, as provided under the Poultry Products Inspection Act, must
make such request to Dr. Rajan so that arrangements may be made for such views to be presented. A record will be made of
all views orally presented. All comments submitted in response to this interim rule will be available for public inspection
in the FSIS Docket Room, room 3171, South Agriculture Building, Washington, DC 20250, from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and
from 1:30 p.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.



Background



To assure compliance with the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA_21 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA_21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq.

), and regulations promulgated under the Acts, samples of meat and poultry products are tested periodically to determine
protein, moisture, fat, and salt content. Analyses are also conducted to determine the presence of any violative
concentrations of drugs or other chemical residues.

When FSIS finds that a product is not in compliance, the Agency is required to take appropriate action against the processor
of that product. Depending on the type of product and the severity of the noncompliance, such action may range from
product reprocessing to litigation proceedings. In view of the critical nature of product testing, it is necessary
for laboratories that analyze official samples of meat and poultry products to maintain a high degree of integrity.

A processor whose sample is to be analyzed generally has the option of using either an FSIS laboratory or an accredited
laboratory. The cost of FSIS analysis is borne by the Government while the cost of non-Federal analysis is borne by
the processor. Due to the limited number of FSIS laboratories and their heavy workload, many processors prefer to
use the non-Federal laboratories either for convenience of location or to obtain test results more quickly.

Section 1327 (7 U.S.C. 138f) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (PL 101-624), as amended,
known as the 1990 Farm Bill, requires USDA to charge a nonrefundable accreditation fee for laboratories seeking accreditation
by the Secretary under the authority of the FMIA or PPIA. The fee is required to be in an amount that will offset the cost
of the ALP. All fees collected by the Secretary of Agriculture are credited to an account from which the expenses of
the Accredited Laboratory Program are paid, and are available immediately and remain available until expended for
the ALP.

Fees are billed annually on a per-accreditation basis. The ALP regulations define an accreditation to be a determination
by FSIS that a laboratory is qualified to analyze official samples of meat and poultry products for the presence and
amount of all four food chemistry analytes (protein, moisture, fat, and salt) or a determination by the Agency that
a laboratory is qualified to analyze official samples of product for the presence and amount of one of several classes
of chemical residues. Accreditations are granted separately for the food chemistry analysis of official samples
and for the analysis of such samples for any one of the several classes of chemical residue. A laboratory may hold more
than one accreditation. 

The user-fee-funded ALP has been in operation since December 13, 1993, the effective date of the final rule that, among
other things, established the accreditation fee (58 FR 65254). FSIS has reviewed its costs incurred to grant and/or
renew a laboratory's accreditation status. A cost analysis was performed on the 1994 rate and it was determined that
the 1995 rate should be reduced. The revised fee was determined by an analysis of the fixed and variable costs of the
service. The cost was calculated to be $2,500 per year, a reduction of $1000 from the 1994 fee.
 This reduction was due to administrative and managerial efficiencies, and the use of interlaboratory accreditation
maintenance check samples only, rather than both check and split samples, to demonstrate acceptable laboratory
performance. 





Each year, FSIS will perform a cost analysis to determine whether the current accreditation fee is adequate to recover
the costs of providing the service for the next year. If the fee is not adequate or is in excess of that required to recover
the costs, a new fee will be established. 

The Agency has determined that the fee for original accreditations and renewals, beginning December 13, 1994 (the
anniversary date for the accreditations of most laboratories in the program), will be $2,500. 

Because the amount of the accreditation fee is mandated by regulation, the regulations must be amended before laboratories
can be billed at the new, reduced rate. As the regulations are now written, the Agency must begin billing December 13
at the existing, higher fee rate of $3,500. However, the Agency has determined that a lower fee should be charged. The
Agency has determined that the lower fee needs to be made effective immediately in order to assure that it collects
the fee it has determined is appropriate and in order to assure that industry will not be burdened unnecessarily by
the charging of a fee that is higher than what is needed. 

FSIS is also making an editorial correction to  318.21(c)(3)(ix), paragraphs (A), (B), and (C), and  381.153(c)(3)(ix),
paragraphs (A), (B), and (C), of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations. In the final rule,
the option for using interlaboratory accreditation check samples was inadvertently omitted from these paragraphs
but included in the introductory sections for these paragraphs. This interim rule merely corrects that editorial
error and makes no substantive change. 

In accordance with section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), for the reasons listed above, the
Agency finds good cause for making this interim rule effective upon publication. At the same time, however, FSIS is
providing for a 30-day comment period. 



Executive Order 12866



This interim rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under
Executive Order 12866.

Executive Order 12778


This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule reduces the accreditation
fees for non-Federal analytical chemistry laboratories accredited under the Federal Meat and Poultry Products
Inspection Acts and regulations promulgated thereunder.
States and local jurisdictions are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products
Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing any requirements with respect to federally inspected premises and facilities,
and operations of such establishments, that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA or
PPIA. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the FMIA and PPIA from imposing any marking, labeling,
packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat or poultry products that are in addition to, or
different than, those imposed under the FMIA or the PPIA, as well as preempted from imposing, under the PPIA for poultry
products, certain storage and handling requirements. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent
jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing
the distribution of meat or poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA or PPIA or, in the case
of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. States and
local jurisdictions may also make requirements or take other actions, that are consistent with the FMIA and PPIA,
with respect to any other matters regulated under the FMIA and PPIA.
Under the FMIA and the PPIA, States that maintain meat and poultry inspection programs must impose requirements that
are at least equal to those required under the FMIA or PPIA. These States may, however, impose more stringent requirements
on such State-inspected products and establishments.
This interim rule will have no retroactive effect and applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted before
any judicial challenge to the application of these provisions. Those administrative procedures are set forth in
9 CFR   306.5, 318.21(h), 381.35, and 381.153(h).


Effect on Small Entities


There are currently approximately 150 laboratories in the FSIS accredited laboratory program. About one quarter
(37) of these are considered small entities.
This interim rule reduces the fee charged for FSIS accreditation from $3,500 per accreditation, per year, to $2,500
per accreditation, per year. All small accredited laboratories are affected by this interim rule. Since the payment
of fees to begin or renew a laboratory's status as ``accredited by FSIS'' is a very small part of total business costs,
FSIS has determined that this rule will not have a significant effect on small entities.

Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model 4101 Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101
airplanes, that currently requires inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron quadrants, replacement
of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. This amendment requires installation
of new swivel bearings in the aileron quadrants, which, when accomplished, will terminate the inspection requirement.
This amendment is prompted by the development of a modification that eliminates the need to inspect repetitively.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could
result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 93-25-10,
Amendment 39-8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), which is applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23031). The action proposed to require installation of new swivel bearings in the left and right
aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) as terminating action for the currently required inspections. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour.
The economic impact information, below has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-0-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances,
at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary,
all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA has
determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of
the AD. 

The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. 

The inspections that were previously required by AD 93-25-10, and retained in this amendment, take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of these inspection requirements on U.S. operators is estimated to be $480, or $60 per airplane, per inspection
cycle. 

The adjustment to the secondary stops that were previously required by AD 93-25-10, and retained in this
amendment, take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this adjustment requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $480,
or $60 per airplane. The FAA estimates that all affected U.S. operators have already accomplished this action; therefore,
the future cost impact of this requirement is minimal. 

The installation of new swivel bearings (Modification JM41307A) that will be required by this amendment will take
approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Required parts
will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
modification requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,800, or $600 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

Adoption of the Amendment 


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


39.13 

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39-8849 (59 FR 11531, 
March 11, 1994), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), amendment 39-9100 to read as follows:





94-26-04 Jetstream Aircraft Limited: 

Amendment 39-9100. Docket 
94-NM-25-AD. Supersedes AD 93-25-10, Amendment 39-8849.

 



Applicability: 

Model 4101 airplanes having constructors numbers 41004 and subsequent; on which Modification JM41307A or JM41307B
has not been installed previously; certificated in any category. 





Note 1: 

This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding 
applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to
the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of
the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (e) to request
approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe
condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should
include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no
case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this
AD.

 



Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could result in reduced controllability of the
airplane, accomplish the following: 
(a) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93-25-10, 
Amendment 39-8849), perform a detailed visual inspection to detect damage of the bearings in the aileron quadrant
in the pilot's and co-pilot's aileron control, in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin
J41-A-27-026, Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994. 
(1) If no damaged bearing is found, repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days. 
(2) If any damaged bearing is found, prior to further flight, replace the damaged bearing with a new bearing in accordance
with the service bulletin, and repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days. 


Note 2: 

Paragraph (a) of this AD restates the requirement for an initial and repetitive inspections contained in paragraph
(a) of AD 93-25-10. Therefore, for operators that have previously accomplished at least the initial inspection
in accordance with AD 93-25-10, paragraph (a) of this AD requires that the next scheduled inspection be
performed within 7 days after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (a) of AD 93-25-10.



(b) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93-25-10, 
Amendment 39-8849), adjust the aileron secondary stop in the pilot's and co-pilot's aileron control system
in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin J41-A-27-026, Revision
1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994.

Note 3: 

Paragraph (b) of this AD restates the requirement to adjust the aileron secondary stop contained in paragraph (b)
of AD 93-25-10. As allowed by the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' if that requirement of AD
93-25-10 has been accomplished previously, this AD does not require that it be repeated.




(c) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93-25-10, 
Amendment 39-8849), revise the Abnormal Procedures Section of the FAA-approved 
Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the
AFM: 

``Where abnormal aileron control backlash is experienced by one pilot, the 
other pilot should assume control of the aircraft without using the 
disconnect facility. The disconnect facility should only be used in 
accordance with published procedures in cases of control restrictions or 
jamming.'' 



Note 4: 

Paragraph (c) of this AD restates the requirement for an AFM revision contained in paragraph (c) of AD 93-25-10.
As allowed by the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' if that requirement of AD 93-25-10 has been
accomplished previously, this AD does not require that it be repeated.

 



(d) Within 180 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, install new swivel bearings in the left and
right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin J41-27-027,
dated January 17, 1994. Accomplishment of this modification constitutes terminating action for the requirements
of this AD. The AFM revision required by paragraph (c) of this AD may be removed following accomplishment of this modification.
 
(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments
and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113.




Note 5: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Standardization Branch, ANM-113.

 



(f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with   21.197 and 
21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the
requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 


(g) The actions shall be done in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin J41-27-027, dated January
17, 1994; and Jetstream Alert Service Bulletin J41-A-27-026, Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993,

Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 series airplanes,
that requires inspection to detect cracking in the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly
of the main landing gear (MLG), and replacement of cracked subassemblies with new or serviceable subassemblies.
This amendment is prompted by reports of cracking in the subassembly of the MLG. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent damage to and/or failure of the support structure of the MLG.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F-28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 series airplanes was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on April 5, 1994 (59 FR 15875). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection to detect cracking in the area
of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the main landing gear (MLG), and replacement of cracked
subassemblies with new or serviceable subassemblies.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.

One commenter supports the proposal.

One commenter requests that the proposed rule be withdrawn and that a supplemental notice be issued that would propose
the accomplishment of a ``refurbishment'' program developed by the commenter. This commenter indicates that the
inspection and rework proposed in the notice may actually aggravate, rather than prevent, damage to the subject fitting
assemblies. This commenter reports that, within several days after reworking the lugs in accordance with the method
proposed in the notice, corrosion damage indications reappeared. In order to ensure that all evidence of corrosion
was removed, the commenter had to accomplish an intensive refurbishment of the main landing gear side stay attachment
lugs. It is this refurbishment process that the commenter requests to be required by the proposed rule.

The FAA does not agree with the commenter's request. The commenter did not provide sufficient data to establish that
the procedure required by this rule (namely, a cleaning procedure that is necessary to remove surface corrosion in
order to obtain an adequate eddy current inspection) contributes to any aggravation of a corrosion condition. The
FAA has determined that the cleaning and eddy current inspection are sufficient, if no cracks are detected, to allow
the main fitting sub-assembly to remain on the airplane until the next overhaul, when a thorough inspection, corrosion
removal, and corrosion control process can be accomplished.

This same commenter requests that the proposed AD be revised to provide ``credit'' for inspections accomplished
during overhaul procedures that were performed prior to the effective date of the final rule. The commenter points
out that Revision 2 of Fokker F28 Service Experience Digest 32-10, Subject No. 008, states that, if the inspection
and restoration of the protective finish on the subject assembly are accomplished, as is recommended during the inspections
called out in the referenced service bulletin or during normal overhaul, no repetitive inspections will be necessary
between overhaul periods. The commenter considers that this implies that the damage to the anodic film is an isolated
occurrence, and that stress corrosion cracking will not occur if the anodic film is intact when the unit enters service.
The commenter states that, compared to a specialized shop environment, field inspections and rework operations
(as proposed in the notice) are less likely to ensure that all corrosion is detected and removed. Further, rework that
exposes end grains and increases stress levels can aggravate, rather than arrest, the propensity for further corrosion.
In this commenter's overhaul shop, corrosion removal is verified after machining by a process beginning with a chemical
etch treatment that removes the surfaced layer of metal smeared by machining, followed by a high-sensitivity fluorescent
penetrant inspection.

The FAA concurs in part. Although the Fokker F28 Service Experience Digest referenced by the commenter does state
that accomplishment of normal overhaul ``will ensure that no repetitive inspections are required between overhaul
periods,'' the overhaul instructions provided may not be entirely adequate to support that statement. Therefore,
the FAA agrees with the commenter's suggestion to provide credit to operators for inspections that were accomplished
during overhaul prior to the effective date of the AD, but only provided that:

1. The overhaul was accomplished within the normal overhaul period (12,000 cycles or 12 years, whichever comes first);
and

2. The overhaul was accomplished in accordance with Dowty Aerospace Landing Gear (DALG) Component Maintenance Manual
(CMM), dated September 1977 or later; and

3. Any resulting repairs were accomplished in accordance with the DALG CMM, dated November 25, 1992, or later; or,
if repairs were accomplished after September 1977 but before November 25, 1992, they were performed with concurrence
(concession) from DALG.

The FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule, to provide such ``credit'' to operators who have performed this
procedure.

One commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to permit the installation of uninspected (non-identified)
subassemblies after the effective date of the AD and until the compliance time for inspection, which is 3 months after
the effective date. This commenter points out that the proposal would require that, as of the effective date of the
final rule, no operator could install any subassembly that had not been previously inspected and identified in accordance
with the requirements of proposed paragraph (a). The commenter is concerned that this would not allow the installation
of an uninspected serviceable part during maintenance that was not related to the AD itself. The commenter states
that this does not appear to be consistent with previous AD's that have dealt with affected parts not installed on an
airplane.

The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Neither does the FAA agree that this is ``not consistent with
previous AD's.'' The FAA has issued numerous AD's over the past years that have called for the removal of discrepant
parts that have been determined to create an unsafe condition; those AD's normally contain a statement indicating
that none of those discrepant-type parts may be installed on any airplane in the future. Such statements are necessary
in order to prohibit the installation of spares of the discrepant part. In general, once an unsafe condition has been
determined to exist with regard to a part, it is the FAA's normal policy not to allow that condition_or that part_to
be re-introduced into the fleet.

Further, in developing the technical information on which every AD is based, one of the important considerations
is the availability of parts that the AD will require to be installed. When it is determined that ample numbers of those
(safe) parts are immediately available to operators, it is the FAA's policy to prohibit installation of the ``unsafe''
parts after the effective date of the AD. Removing an unsafe condition that already exists on an airplane necessarily
involves performing maintenance on the airplane, and the FAA always provides some kind of ``grace period'' in order
to minimize disruption of operations. On the other hand, prohibiting installation of spares that have been determined
to create an unsafe condition does not require any additional maintenance activity; it simply requires use of one
part rather than another.

Put in other terms, the purpose of the AD's compliance time is to give the operators time to get the discrepant parts


off

 the airplane. The time interval selected takes into account not only safety implications, but the size of the fleet
and convenient maintenance schedules. However, the compliance time is not meant as a time for operators to put discrepant
parts 

on

 the airplane in the meantime.

Further, the FAA considers that the period of time between publication of the final rule in the 

Federal Register

 and the effective date of the final rule (usually 30 days) is sufficient to provide operators with an opportunity to
determine their immediate need for modified spares and to obtain them. Of course, in individual cases where this is
not possible, every AD contains a provision that allows an operator to obtain an extension of compliance time based
upon a specific showing of need.

In light of these issues, the FAA finds that prohibiting installation of uninspected (non-identified) subassemblies
on an airplane as of the effective date of this final rule does increase safety and does not impose undue burdens on operators.

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to the final rule to clarify this requirement.

The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour.
The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments above, the FAA has determined that air safety and
the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The AA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.

The FAA estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 14
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $35,280, or $840 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland Model DHC-8 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain de Havilland Model DHC-8 series airplanes, that requires repetitive inspections 
of the passenger service unit (PSU) printed circuit boards and power supply connectors to 
detect corrosion and evidence of overheating; repair or replacement of the circuit boards 
or replacement of connectors, if necessary; and eventual installation of a terminating 
modification. This amendment is prompted by reports that certain PSU printed circuit 
boards and power supply connectors have overheated in service. The actions specified by 
this AD are intended to prevent overheating of the PSU printed circuit board and power 
supply connectors, which could lead to a fire in the PSU.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC-8 series airplanes was published as a 
supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 on 
April 29, 1994 (59 FR 22138). That action proposed to require repetitive inspections of 
the passenger service unit (PSU) printed circuit boards and power supply connectors to 
detect corrosion and evidence of overheating; repair or replacement of the circuit boards 
or replacement of connectors, if necessary; and eventual installation of a modification 
that would terminate the required inspections. 




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 


One commenter supports the proposal. 


Another commenter requests that the proposed requirement to submit inspection 
results to de Havilland be deleted. The commenter states that, since the proposed rule 
would require that a terminating action be accomplished, and since de Havilland has been 
aware of the addressed problem for several years, any data supplied to de Havilland 
through inspection reports would not shed any new light on the problem. The FAA 
concurs. Upon reconsideration of this proposed requirement, the FAA considers the 
submission of reports to be unnecessary. Additionally, de Havilland has advised the FAA 
that it foresees no future need to receive such reports. Accordingly, the FAA has revised 
the final rule by deleting the reporting requirement. 


This same commenter requests that the compliance time for the proposed initial 
inspection be revised to account for new airplanes. The commenter suggests that new 
airplanes should not be required to be inspected for at least 12 months since new. In 
considering this comment, the FAA has determined that the applicability of the final rule 
must be revised to limit it only to airplanes having serial numbers 3 through 369, 
inclusive. Airplanes having serial numbers higher that 369 were delivered with the 
equivalent of Modification 8/1950 (the terminating modification required by this AD) 
installed. In light of this, a revision to the final rule to address ``new'' airplanes, as 
suggested by the commenter, is unnecessary since all of the affected airplanes have 
accumulated more than 12 months since new. 


The FAA has revised the applicability of the final rule to clarify the specific part 
numbers of the subject PSU's installed on the affected airplanes. 


As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA 
points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally 
subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a 
way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA 
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the 
paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this 
final rule to clarify this requirement. 


The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years 
in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various 
inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to 
increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work 
hour. The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase 
in the specified hourly labor rate. 


After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes 
will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the 
AD. 


The FAA estimates that 133 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. 


The required inspections will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to 
accomplish, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the 
total cost impact of the proposed inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$15,960, or $120 per airplane, per inspection. 


The required terminating modification will require approximately 3 work hours 
per PSU to accomplish, at an average labor cost of $60 per work hour. Required parts 
would cost approximately $62 per PSU. Each airplane is equipped with between 18 and 
26 PSU's. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification on 
U.S. operators is estimated to be $242 per PSU, or between $4,356 and $6,292 per 
airplane. 


The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. However, the FAA has been advised that the initial inspection has already been 
accomplished on approximately 22 airplanes; therefore the future economic impact of this 
rule is reduced by at least $2,640.

Airworthiness Directives; Robinson Helicopter Company Model R44 Series Helicopters 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Robinson Helicopter Company
(RHC) Model R44 series helicopters, that currently requires removal and replacement of specific parts of the cyclic
control system. This amendment requires the same removal and replacement of specific parts of the cyclic control
system, corrects a replacement part number, and changes the applicability to cover certain serial-numbered helicopters.
This amendment is prompted by the need to correct the existing AD by changing the applicability to include additional
serial-numbered helicopters and to correct a replacement part number that was incorrectly stated in the existing
AD. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the cyclic control system and subsequent loss
of control of the helicopter. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 18, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94-17-18, Amendment 39-9013 (59 FR 43726, August 25, 1994),
to require immediate removal and replacement of specific parts of the cyclic control system in accordance with the
applicable maintenance manual. That action was prompted by an accident involving an RHC Model R44 series helicopter.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the probable cause for the accident was fatigue failure
of the cyclic stick assembly, a part of the cyclic control system. The pilot uses the cyclic control system to control
the flight attitude of the helicopter. If the cyclic control system fails, the pilot loses the ability to make cyclic
control inputs to the main rotor system. After reviewing the NTSB report, the FAA has determined that certain parts
of the same design as those installed on the accident helicopter need to be replaced before further flight. That condition,
if not corrected, could result in failure of the cyclic control system and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.




Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has become aware of an error in the AD. One of the cyclic control system replacement
part numbers was incorrectly stated as C211-3. That part number should have been part number A211-3. Additionally,
that AD should have been applicable to RHC Model R44 series helicopters, with serial numbers (S/N) less than but not
including S/N 0017, since the manufacturing records indicate the design changes required by that AD were incorporated
by RHC into the RHC Model R44 production line, beginning with helicopter S/N 0017. Upon review, the FAA has determined
that the original cyclic control system design meets existing FAA design standards, but has limited damage tolerance
characteristics and does not display slow crack growth properties. When damaged or flawed, the cyclic stick assembly
can fail due to fatigue prior to its retirement time of 4,000 hours time-in-service. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other RHC Model R44 series helicopters
of the same type design, this AD supersedes AD 94-17-18 and is being issued to prevent failure of the cyclic
control system and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. This AD requires removal and replacement of certain
parts of the cyclic control system of the affected helicopters as well as changes the applicability of this AD to include
certain serial-numbered helicopters. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the applicable
maintenance manual. Due to the critical need to (1) ensure the integrity of the cyclic control system, (2) comply with
the requirements of this AD before further flight, and (3) require replacement of certain parts on certain serial-numbered
helicopters, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in the affected helicopters. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-SW-18-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Amendment 39-9096; AD 94-25-12] 



Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125-1000A Series Airplanes 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe
125-1000A series airplanes, that requires modification of the galley feeder cables and toilet services fuse.
This amendment is prompted by a report that the gauge size of the existing galley feeder cable is not compatible with
the rating of the currently used toilet services fuse. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure that
the subject cables are compatible with the toilet services fuse in order to prevent overheating of the cables, which
could result in smoke and fire in the cabin. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125-1000A series airplanes was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on July 5, 1994 (59 FR 34396). That action proposed to require modification of the galley feeder cables and toilet services
fuse. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 

The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour.
The economic impact information, below has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.


As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances,
at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary,
all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA has
determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of
the AD. 

The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 16 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $5,840, or $1,460 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

S Corporation Built-In Gain Tax



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document prescribes final regulations under section 1374 relating to the tax imposed on an S corporation's net
recognized built-in gain. The final regulations reflect changes to the law in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The final
regulations generally affect only corporations that changed from C to S status.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. Background



Section 1374 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) generally imposes a corporate-level tax on an S corporation's
recognition of income or gain to the extent the income or gain reflects unrealized appreciation (or its equivalent)
in the corporation when it converted from C to S status. Section 1374 was amended to provide this treatment as part of
the legislation repealing the 

General Utilities 

rule. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., Vol. II, 198-207 (1986), 1986-3 C.B., Vol. 4, 198-207.

Section 1374 generally applies to an S corporation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, but only if
the corporation elects S status after December 31, 1986. Sections 1374(e) and 337(d) provide specific authority
to promulgate regulations under section 1374.

Proposed regulations under section 1374 were published in the 

Federal Register 

on December 8, 1992 (57 FR 57971, or 1992-2 C.B. 594). This document adds new   1.1374-0 through
1.1374-10 to 26 CFR Part 1.



2. Section 1374 and the Proposed Regulations



Section 1374(a) imposes a tax on an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year beginning in
the 10-year recognition period following the S corporation's conversion from a C corporation or acquisition of C
corporation assets in a carryover basis transaction. The proposed regulations provide that an S corporation's net
recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is the least of (1) its taxable income determined by using the rules applying
to C corporations and considering only recognized built-in gain and recognized built-in loss (the pre-limitation
amount), (2) its taxable income determined by using the rules applying to C corporations and considering all items
except as provided under section 1375(b)(1)(B) (the taxable income limitation), or (3) the excess of its net unrealized
built-in gain over net recognized built-in gain for all prior taxable years in the recognition period (the net unrealized
built-in gain limitation).

Section 1374(d)(3) provides that any gain recognized on the disposition of an asset during the recognition period
is recognized built-in gain except to the extent the S corporation establishes that it did not hold the asset on the
first day of the recognition period or the asset appreciated after that day. Section 1374(d)(4) provides that any
loss recognized on a disposition of an asset during the recognition period is recognized built-in loss to the extent
the S corporation establishes that it held the asset on the first day of the recognition period and the asset depreciated
before that day. The proposed regulations provide that sections 1374(d) (3) and (4) apply only to transactions treated
as sales or exchanges under the Code.

Section 1374(d)(5)(A) provides that any item of income properly taken into account during the recognition period
but attributable to periods before the first day of the recognition period is recognized built-in gain. Section 1374(d)(5)(B)
provides that any item of deduction properly taken into account during the recognition period but attributable to
periods before the first day of the recognition period is recognized built-in loss. The proposed regulations provide
that an S corporation's items of income or deduction generally are recognized built-in gain or loss if the item would
have been included in gross income or allowed as a deduction against gross income before the recognition period by
an accrual method taxpayer (accrual method rule). The proposed regulations provide that all rules applying to accrual
method taxpayers (whether from the Code, regulations, administrative pronouncements, or otherwise) also apply
for purposes of the accrual method rule with two exceptions: (1) Section 461(h)(2)(C), relating to liabilities for
tort and worker's compensation for which payment constitutes economic performance, and (2) section 469, relating
to suspended passive activity losses. The proposed regulations also provide special rules for certain items including
an S corporation's section 481(a) adjustments, income reported under the completed contract method, income reported
under the installment method, and distributive share of partnership items.
Section 1374(d)(1) provides that an S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is the amount by which the fair market
value of all its assets exceeds the aggregate adjusted bases of all its assets as of the beginning of the recognition
period. Section 1374(d)(5)(C) provides that an S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is properly adjusted
for items of income and deduction that would be recognized built-in gain or loss if taken into account during the recognition
period. The proposed regulations provide that the S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is determined by
reference to a hypothetical sale of all the assets of the corporation immediately before the beginning of the recognition
period to a buyer that assumed all the corporation's liabilities.
Section 1374(b)(2) provides that an S corporation's net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards
arising in years for which the corporation was a C corporation are allowed as deductions against net recognized built-in
gain. The proposed regulations provide that no other loss carryforwards may be used as a deduction against net recognized
built-in gain. Section 1374(b)(3) provides that an S corporation's special fuels credit for the year, and business
credit carryforwards and minimum tax credit arising in years for which the corporation was a C corporation, are allowed
as credits against the section 1374 tax. The proposed regulations provide that no other credits or credit carryforwards
may be used as a credit against the section 1374 tax. The loss carryforwards, credits, and credit carryforwards allowed
to reduce the section 1374 tax are collectively referred to as the section 1374 attributes in the final regulations.

3. Public Comments and the Final Regulations


The IRS received written and oral comments from the public on the proposed regulations both in connection with the
public hearing held on April 28, 1993, and otherwise. The issues raised by these comments are discussed below.


A. Accounting Methods


Commentators request guidance about the accounting methods an S corporation should use in determining its pre-limitation
amount and taxable income limitation. The commentators suggest that an S corporation should be allowed to use any
accounting method it could use if it were a C corporation. The final regulations do not adopt this suggestion because
section 1374 applies only to items an S corporation actually takes into account during the recognition period. It
does not apply to items the corporation would have taken into account under a hypothetical method of accounting. Accordingly,
the final regulations require the S corporation to use the accounting methods it actually uses as an S corporation
to make these taxable income determinations.


B. Recognition Period


Commentators request confirmation that the recognition period is the 10 calendar year period (and not the 10 taxable
year period) beginning on the first day the corporation is an S corporation or the day the S corporation acquires C corporation
assets in a carryover basis transaction. The final regulations confirm the commentators' interpretation of the
Code. 
Commentators also request guidance on determining an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain where the recognition
period ends during a taxable year (for example, because a corporation converting from C to S status was on a fiscal year
as a C corporation and changed to a calendar year as an S corporation or because an S corporation acquired C corporation
assets in a carryover basis transaction during a taxable year). The final regulations provide that the pre-limitation
amount for the year is determined by a closing of the books at the end of the recognition period.


C. Accrual Method Rule and Section 267(a)(2) or 404(a)(5)


One commentator argues that the proposed regulations should not use the accrual method rule to determine if, and the
extent to which, an item of income or deduction is included in net recognized built-in gain. Instead, this commentator
argues that the approach the proposed regulations use to determine if, and the extent to which, an item of income or
deduction is included in net unrealized built-in gain (that is, by valuation using a hypothetical sale of all the S
corporation's assets to a buyer that assumes all the S corporation's liabilities) should also be used to determine
if, and the extent to which, an item of income or deduction is included in net recognized built-in gain.
The Treasury and the IRS believe that separately valuing each item of income and deduction for net recognized built-in
gain purposes would be unduly burdensome both for taxpayers and for the IRS. Using a valuation approach for determining
net unrealized built-in gain is not unduly burdensome because net unrealized built-in gain can be determined by valuing
the S corporation's business using an aggregate approach where particular items of income and deduction are not valued
individually. In addition, many S corporations subject to section 1374 will not need to know their net unrealized
built-in gain because they will not approach their net unrealized built-in gain limitation in the recognition period.
However, most S corporations subject to section 1374 will have items of income and deduction taken into account in
the recognition period where a determination must be made if, and the extent to which, the item is included in net recognized
built-in gain. Accordingly, the final regulations do not adopt the commentator's suggestion and generally retain
the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations. 
Some commentators argue that the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations wrongly applies sections 267(a)(2),
relating to accrued amounts payable to related persons, and 404(a)(5), relating to accrued amounts payable as deferred
compensation, to determine whether an item of deduction should be treated as a recognized built-in loss. In general,
those sections defer a deduction for an accrual method taxpayer that owes a payment to a cash method taxpayer until
the payment is made. The commentators cite the following statement in the section 1374 legislative history in support
of their position:




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-0-00047 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As an example of these built-in gain and loss provisions, in the case of a cash basis personal service corporation that
converts to S status and that has receivables at the time of the conversion, the receivables, when received, are built-in
gain items. At the same time, built-in losses would include otherwise deductible compensation paid after the conversion
to the persons who performed the services that produced the receivables, to the extent such compensation is attributable
to such pre-conversion services. To the extent such built-in loss items offset the built-in gains from the receivables,
there would be no amount subject to the built-in gains tax.



H.R. Rep. No. 795, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 63-64 (1988). 



The commentators suggest that the accrual method rule in the final regulations should be applied without regard to
sections 267(a)(2) and 404(a)(5). The Treasury and the IRS disagree with the commentators that the legislative history
quoted above precludes the adoption of the accrual method rule of the proposed regulations. The accrual method rule
in the proposed regulations was adopted as an administrable method for both taxpayers and the Service to determine
the extent to which an amount included in income or deducted in the recognition period is attributable to the pre-recognition
period. Nevertheless, in response to the commentators' requests, the final regulations extend recognized built-in
loss treatment for certain amounts properly deducted under section 267(a)(2) or 404(a)(5) in the recognition period.


The final regulations provide that an amount properly deducted under section 267(a)(2) is recognized built-in loss
to the extent (i) all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount
of the liability can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period, and (ii) the amount is paid in the
first two and one-half months of the recognition period, or is paid to an individual that owned less than 5 percent of
the corporation's stock. The final regulations provide that an amount properly deducted under section 404(a)(5)
is recognized built-in loss to the extent (i) all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay
the amount, and the exact amount of the liability can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period,
and (ii) the amount is not deductible under section 267(a)(2). The Treasury and the IRS believe that these rules are
relatively easy for taxpayers and the IRS to apply and also provide relief from the deferral of deductions under section
267(a)(2) or 404(a)(5). The additional limitations for amounts deducted under section 267(a)(2) are needed because
of the particular difficulty in determining whether amounts paid to related parties are attributable to services
performed before or after the beginning of the recognition period.

The final regulations also modify the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations as follows: (1) An exception
from the accrual method rule for items deducted under  1.461-4(g) is added (relating to items in addition
to those specified in section 461(h)(2)(C) for which payment constitutes economic performance); and (2) the exception
from the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations for items deducted under section 469 is eliminated. The  1.461-4(g)
exception is added to clarify the section 461(h)(2)(C) exception in the proposed regulations. The section 469 exception
is eliminated because losses suspended before the recognition period under section 469 cannot be used in the recognition
period under section 1371(b)(1). 



D. Section 481 Adjustments



The proposed regulations provide that any item of income or deduction properly taken into account during the recognition
period under section 481 is recognized built-in gain or loss if the item is taken into account because of a change of
accounting method effective before the beginning of the second year of the recognition period (``one-year rule'').
In certain cases, this one-year rule has the effect of (1) omitting income attributable to the corporation's C period
altogether at the corporate level, (2) including income attributable to the corporation's C period twice at the corporate
level, (3) omitting a deduction attributable to the corporation's C period altogether at the corporate level, or
(4) allowing a deduction attributable to the corporation's C period twice at the corporate level, because the section
481 adjustment on the change in accounting method is not treated as recognized built-in gain or loss. In addition,
the Treasury and the Service believe that in most cases the portion of a section 481(a) adjustment attributable to
the pre-recognition period and the portion attributable to the recognition period can be determined without undue
administrative difficulty.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-0-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The final regulations, therefore, provide that any section 481(a) adjustment taken into account in the recognition
period that prevents an omission or duplication of income or deduction is recognized built-in gain or loss to the extent
the adjustment relates to items attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the
principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in the regulations.



E. Installment Method



The proposed regulations impose a section 1374 tax on income reported under the installment method either during
or after the recognition period in accordance with Notice 90-27, 1990-1 C.B. 336. The tax is imposed only
to the extent the income would have been included in net recognized built-in gain if it had been reported in the year
of the sale and all provisions of section 1374 applied including the taxable income limitation. 

Several commentators argue that the proposed regulations wrongly impose a section 1374 tax on income reported under
the installment method after the recognition period. In addition, they contend that the proposed regulations wrongly
apply the taxable income limitation by reference to the S corporation's cumulative taxable income from the year of
the installment sale to the year that income is reported under the installment method (assuming the income had been
reported in the year of the sale) instead of the S corporation's taxable income in the year that income was reported
under the installment method. Further, they believe that, where income is reported under the installment method
after the recognition period, the proposed regulations are unclear regarding the proper use of section 1374 attributes
and loss recognized after the recognition period that would have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized
during the recognition period. 

The final regulations retain the installment method rules in the proposed regulations because the Treasury and the
IRS believe those rules are necessary to prevent an abuse of section 1374. The final regulations clarify the use of
an S corporation's section 1374 attributes and loss recognized after the recognition period where income is reported
under the installment method for a year after the recognition period. Section 1374 attributes may be used to the extent
their use is allowed under all applicable provisions of the Code. However, the S corporation's loss recognized in
a year after the recognition period may not be used to reduce the section 1374 tax.



F. Partnership Items



The proposed regulations generally provide that an S corporation owning an interest in a partnership must treat its
distributive share of the partnership's items as recognized built-in gain or loss to the extent the S corporation's
distributive share would have been treated as recognized built-in gain or loss if the items originated in, and were
taken into account directly by, the S corporation (the look-through rules). The look-through rules generally apply
only to the extent the S corporation had built-in gain or built-in loss in its partnership interest at the beginning
of the recognition period. The proposed regulations contain a small interest exception from the look-through rules
for any taxable year where the S corporation's partnership interest has a value less than $100,000 and represents
less than a 10 percent interest in the partnership's capital and profits at all times during the year. The small interest
exception does not apply if the partnership was formed or availed of with a principal purpose to avoid the section 1374
tax. The proposed regulations provide that if an S corporation disposes of its partnership interest during the recognition
period, the amount treated as recognized built-in gain or loss on the disposition is adjusted to take into account
amounts treated as recognized built-in gain or loss under the look-through rules. The proposed regulations also
provide special rules for section 704(c) gain and loss, and where an S corporation disposes of distributed partnership
assets.

Commentators argue that the look-through rules should apply only where an S corporation controls the partnership
or the primary use of the partnership by the S corporation is to avoid section 1374 because, except where the S corporation
is the controlling partner, the S corporation is not likely to have access to information and records necessary to
identify and value partnership section 1374 items. In addition, the commentators suggest modifying the small interest
exception to the look-through rules so that the small interest test is generally applied only on the first day of the
recognition period. The commentators believe that subsequent increases or decreases in the fair market value of
the partnership interest should be disregarded.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-0-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The final regulations retain the look-through rules. Access to information and records necessary to identify and
value partnership section 1374 items is not dependent on whether the S corporation is a controlling partner. Moreover,
section 1374 should generally apply to an S corporation's partnership section 1374 items even where a principal purpose
for using the partnership was not to avoid the section 1374 tax. 
The final regulations, however, modify the small interest exception to the look-through rules to accommodate the
commentators' request for a rule requiring a valuation of the partnership interest only on the first day of the recognition
period. Under the rule as modified, the small interest exception generally applies for a taxable year if the S corporation's
interest in the partnership represents less than 10 percent of the partnership's profits and capital at all times
during the taxable year and prior taxable years in the recognition period and has a value less than $100,000 as of the
beginning of the recognition period. However, if the S corporation contributes an asset to the partnership in the
recognition period and the S corporation held the asset as of the beginning of the recognition period, the fair market
value of the S corporation's partnership interest as of the beginning of the recognition period is determined as if
the asset was contributed to the partnership before the beginning of the recognition period (using the fair market
value of the asset as of the beginning of the recognition period).


G. Valuing Inventory


The proposed regulations provide that the value of an S corporation's inventory on the first day of the recognition
period equals the amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the inventory in a purchase of all the S corporation's
assets on that day. Commentators argue that the rules for valuing inventory in the proposed regulations are unclear
and should be clarified to provide a non-liquidation, non-distress, bulk sale approach, which generally will result
in a value for the inventory less than retail value.
The final regulations provide that the value of an S corporation's inventory on the first day of the recognition period
generally is determined by reference to a sale of the entire business of the S corporation to a buyer that expects to
continue to operate that business. The buyer and seller are presumed not to be under any compulsion to buy or sell and
to have reasonable knowledge of all relevant facts. Relevant facts include (1) the replacement cost of the inventory;
(2) the expected retail selling price of the inventory; (3) the seller's incentive to demand a price for the inventory
that would compensate for and provide a fair return for expenditures the seller incurred to obtain, prepare, carry,
and dispose of the inventory before the sale of the business; and (4) the buyer's incentive to pay a price for the inventory
that would compensate for and provide a fair return for similar expenditures the buyer expects to incur after the sale
of the business. It is expected that the value of an S corporation's inventory as determined under the final regulations
will generally be less than its anticipated retail price, but greater than its replacement cost.
The preamble to the proposed regulations describes a safe harbor rule that was being considered for publication as
a revenue procedure under which the value of inventory for purposes of section 1374 would be determined using a formula.
One commentator endorsed the general idea of adopting a safe harbor rule, but objected to the rule described in the
preamble and did not suggest an alternative rule. No commentators supported the rule described in the preamble of
the proposed regulations or suggested an alternative rule.

<DOCNO> FR941227-0-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

At this time, the IRS is not planning to issue a revenue procedure setting forth a safe harbor rule for valuing inventory.
However, consideration will be given to any safe harbor rule taxpayers may suggest in the future.


H. Section 1374(d)(8) Transactions


Section 1374(d)(8) imposes a section 1374 tax if an S corporation acquires assets in a transaction where the S corporation's
basis in the assets is determined by reference to their basis in the hands of a C corporation (a section 1374(d)(8) transaction)
and, thereafter, the S corporation disposes of the assets. The proposed regulations provide that a separate determination
of tax under section 1374 must be made for the assets acquired in each section 1374(d)(8) transaction. Thus, an S corporation's
section 1374 attributes held on the day it became an S corporation may only be used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed
on dispositions of assets the S corporation held on that day. Similarly, section 1374 attributes acquired by an S corporation
in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction may only be used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets
the S corporation acquired in the same transaction.
Commentators argue that restrictions on the use of section 1374 attributes acquired by an S corporation in a section
1374(d)(8) transaction should not be greater than the restrictions that would apply if the attributes were acquired
by a C corporation in a similar transaction. For example, commentators contend that an S corporation's net operating
loss carryforwards when it changed from C to S status should be allowed to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed on assets
the S corporation acquires in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction, subject to all statutory limits on their use including
the anti-trafficking rules of sections 382, 383, and 384. 
The final regulations retain the rules in the proposed regulations. Section 1374(d)(8) imposes a section 1374 tax
on the ``net recognized built-in gain attributable to'' the assets acquired in a particular transaction. The legislative
history under section 1374 states that ``each acquisition of assets from a C corporation is subject to a separate determination
of the amount of net built-in gain * * *.'' H.R. Rep. No. 795, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 63 (1988). 


I. Effective Date and Additional Rules


The proposed regulations provide that the section 1374 final regulations will generally apply for taxable years
ending on or after the date the final regulations are published in the 

Federal Register

, but only where the return is filed pursuant to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after
that date. The final regulations retain the effective date in the proposed regulations.
The proposed regulations provide that if a taxpayer subject to section 1374, but not generally subject to the regulations,
contributes an asset to a partnership under section 721(a) in contemplation of making an S election or during the recognition
period, section 1374 applies on a disposition of the asset by the partnership as if the S corporation still owned the
asset. This provision applies as of the effective date of section 1374. Commentators argue that the rule should apply
only for contributions to partnerships after the proposed regulations were issued. The final regulations retain
the rule in the proposed regulations to prevent an abuse of section 1374. 
The proposed regulations provide that the rules in Announcement 86-128, 1986-51 I.R.B. 22, and Notice
90-27, 1990-1 C.B. 336, apply to taxpayers subject to section 1374, but not generally subject to the regulations.
Instead of referring to the rules in the Notice and the Announcement, the final regulations set forth some of the rules
contained in those documents. 
Commentators suggest that the regulations allow taxpayers subject to section 1374, but not generally subject to
the regulations, to elect to be subject to the regulations. The final regulations do not adopt this suggestion because
of the burden of administering elections and because taxpayers not generally subject to the regulations nonetheless
may take positions consistent with the regulations.


Special Analysis


It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations.
Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking for these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.


Drafting Information


The principal author of these regulations is Mark S. Jennings of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate),
IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

 1.1374-1 

General rules and definitions.



(a) 

Computation of tax.

 The tax imposed on the income of an S corporation by section 1374(a) for any taxable year during the recognition period
is computed as follows_

(1) Step One: Determine the net recognized built-in gain of the corporation for the taxable year under section 1374(d)(2)
and  1.1374-2; 

(2) Step Two: Reduce the net recognized built-in gain (but not below zero) by any net operating loss and capital loss
carryforward allowed under section 1374(b)(2) and  1.1374-5;

(3) Step Three: Compute a tentative tax by applying the rate of tax determined under section 1374(b)(1) for the taxable
year to the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section;

(4) Step Four: Compute the final tax by reducing the tentative tax (but not below zero) by any credit allowed under section
1374(b)(3) and  1.1374-6.

(b) 

Anti-trafficking rules.

 If section 382, 383, or 384 would have applied to limit the use of a corporation's recognized built-in loss or section
1374 attributes at the beginning of the first day of the recognition period if the corporation had remained a C corporation,
these sections apply to limit their use in determining the S corporation's pre-limitation amount, taxable income
limitation, net unrealized built-in gain limitation, deductions against net recognized built-in gain, and credits
against the section 1374 tax. 

(c) 

Section 1374 attributes.

 Section 1374 attributes are the loss carryforwards allowed under section 1374(b)(2) as a deduction against net recognized
built-in gain and the credit and credit carryforwards allowed under section 1374(b)(3) as a credit against the section
1374 tax. 

(d)

 Recognition period.

 The recognition period is the 10-year (120-month) period beginning on the first day the corporation is an S corporation
or the day an S corporation acquires assets in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction. For example, if the first day of the
recognition period is July 14, 1996, the last day of the recognition period is July 13, 2006. If the recognition period
for certain assets ends during an S corporation's taxable year (for example, because the corporation was on a fiscal
year as a C corporation and changed to a calendar year as an S corporation or because an S corporation acquired assets
in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction during a taxable year), the S corporation must determine its pre-limitation
amount (as defined in  1.1374-2(a)(1)) for the year as if the corporation's books were closed at the end
of the recognition period.

(e) 

Predecessor corporation.

 For purposes of section 1374(c)(1), if the basis of an asset of the S corporation is determined (in whole or in part)
by reference to the basis of the asset (or any other property) in the hands of another corporation, the other corporation
is a predecessor corporation of the S corporation.

 1.1374-2

Net recognized built-in gain.






(a) 

In general. 

An S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is the least of_


(1) Its taxable income determined by using all rules applying to C corporations and considering only its recognized
built-in gain, recognized built-in loss, and recognized built-in gain carryover (pre-limitation amount); 


(2) Its taxable income determined by using all rules applying to C corporations as modified by section 1375(b)(1)(B)
(taxable income limitation); and


(3) The amount by which its net unrealized built-in gain exceeds its net recognized built-in gain for all prior taxable
years (net unrealized built-in gain limitation).


(b) 

Allocation rule. 

If an S corporation's pre-limitation amount for any taxable year exceeds its net recognized built-in gain for that
year, the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain consists of a ratable portion of each item of income, gain,
loss, and deduction included in the pre-limitation amount. 


(c) 

Recognized built-in gain carryover. 

If an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is equal to its taxable income limitation,
the amount by which its pre-limitation amount exceeds its taxable income limitation is a recognized built-in gain
carryover included in its pre-limitation amount for the succeeding taxable year. The recognized built-in gain carryover
consists of that portion of each item of income, gain, loss, and deduction not included in the S corporation's net recognized
built-in gain for the year the carryover arose, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section. 


(d) 

Accounting methods. 

In determining its taxable income for pre-limitation amount and taxable income limitation purposes, a corporation
must use the accounting method(s) it uses for tax purposes as an S corporation.


(e) 

Example. 

The rules of this section are illustrated by the following example. 







Example. Net recognized built-in gain. 

X is a calendar year C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. X has a net unrealized built-in
gain of $50,000 and no net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. In 1996, X has a pre-limitation amount of $20,000,
consisting of ordinary income of $15,000 and capital gain of $5,000, a taxable income limitation of $9,600, and a net
unrealized built-in gain limitation of $50,000. Therefore, X's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 is $9,600,
because that is the least of the three amounts described in paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b) of this
section, X's net recognized built-in gain consists of recognized built-in ordinary income of $7,200 [$15,000 x ($9,600/$20,000)=$7,200]
and recognized built-in capital gain of $2,400 [$5,000 x ($9,600/$20,000)=$2,400]. Under paragraph (c)
of this section, X has a recognized built-in gain carryover to 1997 of $10,400 ($20,000^$9,600=$10,400), consisting
of $7,800 ($15,000^$7,200=$7,800) of recognized built-in ordinary income and $2,600 ($5,000^$2,400=$2,600)
of recognized built-in capital gain.



 1.1374-3

Net unrealized built-in gain.





(a) 

In general. 

An S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is the total of the following_


(1) The amount that would be the amount realized if, at the beginning of the first day of the recognition period, the
corporation had remained a C corporation and had sold all its assets at fair market value to an unrelated party that
assumed all its liabilities; decreased by 


(2) Any liability of the corporation that would be included in the amount realized on the sale referred to in paragraph
(a)(1) of this section, but only if the corporation would be allowed a deduction on payment of the liability; decreased
by 


(3) The aggregate adjusted bases of the corporation's assets at the time of the sale referred to in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section; increased or decreased by 


(4) The corporation's section 481 adjustments that would be taken into account on the sale referred to in paragraph
(a)(1) of this section; and increased by


(5) Any recognized built-in loss that would not be allowed as a deduction under section 382, 383, or 384 on the sale referred
to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(b) 

Example. 

The rules of this section are illustrated by the following example. 







Example. Net unrealized built-in gain. 

(i) (a) X, a calendar year C corporation using the cash method, elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996.
On December 31, 1995, X has assets and liabilities as follows:

<TEXT>
 

(b) Further, X must include a total of $60,000 in taxable income in 1996, 1997, and 1998 under section 481(a). 

(ii) If, on December 31, 1995, X sold all its assets to a third party that assumed all its liabilities, X's amount realized
would be $1,050,000 ($750,000 cash received+$300,000 liabilities assumed=$1,050,000). Thus, X's net unrealized
built-in gain is determined as follows:







 1.1374-4

Recognized built-in gain or loss.





(a) 

Sales and exchanges

_(1) 

In general. 

Section 1374(d)(3) or 1374(d)(4) applies to any gain or loss recognized during the recognition period in a transaction
treated as a sale or exchange for federal income tax purposes. 



(2) 

Oil and gas property. 

For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an S corporation's adjusted basis in oil and gas property equals
the sum of the shareholders' adjusted bases in the property as determined in section 613A(c)(11)(B).



(3) 

Examples. 

The rules of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following examples.









Example 1. Production and sale of oil. 

X is a C corporation that purchased a working interest in an oil and gas property for $100,000 on July 1, 1993. X elects
to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, the working interest has a fair market value of $250,000
and an adjusted basis of $50,000, but no oil has as yet been extracted. In 1996, X begins production of the working interest,
sells oil that it has produced to a refinery for $75,000, and includes that amount in gross income. Under paragraph
(a)(1) of this section, the $75,000 is not recognized built-in gain because as of the beginning of the recognition
period X held only a working interest in the oil and gas property (since the oil had not yet been extracted from the ground),
and not the oil itself. 





Example 2. Sale of oil and gas property. 

Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. Y has two shareholders, A and B.
A and B each own 50 percent of Y's stock. In addition, Y owns a royalty interest in an oil and gas property with a fair market
value of $300,000 and an adjusted basis of $200,000. Under section 613A(c)(11)(B), Y's $200,000 adjusted basis in
the royalty interest is allocated $100,000 to A and $100,000 to B. During 1996, A and B take depletion deductions with
respect to the royalty interest of $10,000 and $15,000, respectively. As of January 1, 1997, A and B have a basis in the
royalty interest of $90,000 and $85,000, respectively. On January 1, 1997, Y sells the royalty interest for $250,000.
Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, Y has gain recognized and recognized built-in gain of $75,000 ($250,000^($90,000+$85,000)=$75,000)
on the sale.







(b) 

Accrual method rule

_(1) 

Income items

. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any item of income properly taken into account during the recognition
period is recognized built-in gain if the item would have been properly included in gross income before the beginning
of the recognition period by an accrual method taxpayer (disregarding any method of accounting for which an election
by the taxpayer must be made unless the taxpayer actually used the method when it was a C corporation).

(2) 

Deduction items. 

Except as otherwise provided in this section, any item of deduction properly taken into account during the recognition
period is recognized built-in loss if the item would have been properly allowed as a deduction against gross income
before the beginning of the recognition period to an accrual method taxpayer (disregarding any method of accounting
for which an election by the taxpayer must be made unless the taxpayer actually used the method when it was a C corporation).
In determining whether an item would have been properly allowed as a deduction against gross income by an accrual method
taxpayer for purposes of this paragraph, section 461(h)(2)(C) and  1.461-4(g) (relating to liabilities
for tort, worker's compensation, breach of contract, violation of law, rebates, refunds, awards, prizes, jackpots,
insurance contracts, warranty contracts, service contracts, taxes, and other liabilities) do not apply. 
(3) 

Examples. 

The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples.






Example 1. Accounts receivable. 

X is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On January
1, 1996, X has $50,000 of accounts receivable for services rendered before that date. On that date, the accounts receivable
have a fair market value of $40,000 and an adjusted basis of $0. In 1996, X collects $50,000 on the accounts receivable
and includes that amount in gross income. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $50,000 included in gross income
in 1996 is recognized built-in gain because it would have been included in gross income before the beginning of the
recognition period if X had been an accrual method taxpayer. However, if X instead disposes of the accounts receivable
for $45,000 on July 1, 1996, in a transaction treated as a sale or exchange for federal income tax purposes, X would have
recognized built-in gain of $40,000 on the disposition. 



Example 2. Contingent liability. 

Y is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995,
a lawsuit was filed against Y claiming $1,000,000 in damages. In 1996, Y loses the lawsuit, pays a $500,000 judgment,
and properly claims a deduction for that amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $500,000 deduction allowed
in 1996 is not recognized built-in loss because it would not have been allowed as a deduction against gross income before
the beginning of the recognition period if Y had been an accrual method taxpayer (even disregarding section 461(h)(2)(C)
and  1.461-4(g)).



Example 3. Deferred payment liabilities. 

X is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. In 1995, X lost a lawsuit
and became obligated to pay $150,000 in damages. Under section 461(h)(2)(C), this amount is not allowed as a deduction
until X makes payment. In 1996, X makes payment and properly claims a deduction for the amount of the payment. Under
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $150,000 deduction allowed in 1996 is recognized built-in loss because it would
have been allowed as a deduction against gross income before the beginning of the recognition period if X had been an
accrual method taxpayer (disregarding section 461(h)(2)(C) and  1.461-4(g)).



Example 4. Deferred prepayment income. 

Y is a C corporation using an accrual method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995,
Y received $2,500 for services to be rendered in 1996, and properly elected to include the $2,500 in gross income in
1996 under Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549 (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter). Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $2,500 included in gross income in 1996 is not recognized
built-in gain because it would not have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period
by an accrual method taxpayer using the method that Y actually used before the beginning of the recognition period.



Example 5. Change in method. 

X is a C corporation using an accrual method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995,
X received $5,000 for services to be rendered in 1996, and properly included the $5,000 in gross income. In 1996, X properly
elects to include the $5,000 in gross income in 1996 under Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549 (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter). As a result of the change in method of accounting, X has a $5,000 negative section 481(a) adjustment.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $5,000 included in gross income in 1996 is recognized built-in gain because
it would have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period by an accrual method taxpayer
using the method that X actually used before the beginning of the recognition period. In addition, the $5,000 negative
section 481(a) adjustment is recognized built-in loss because it relates to an item (the $5,000 X received for services
in 1995) attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining
recognized built-in gain or loss in this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for rules regarding section 481(a)
adjustments. 




(c)


Section 267(a)(2) and 404(a)(5) deductions

_(1) 

Section 267(a)(2). 

Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any amount properly deducted in the recognition period under
section 267(a)(2), relating to payments to related parties, is recognized built-in loss to the extent_

(i) All events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability
can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period; and
(ii) The amount is paid_
(A) In the first two and one-half months of the recognition period; or 
(B) To a related party owning, under the attribution rules of section 267, less than 5 percent, by voting power and value,
of the corporation's stock, both as of the beginning of the recognition period and when the amount is paid.
(2) 

Section 404(a)(5). 

Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any amount properly deducted in the recognition period under
section 404(a)(5), relating to payments for deferred compensation, is recognized built-in loss to the extent_
(i) All events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability
can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period; and
(ii) The amount is not paid to a related party to which section 267(a)(2) applies. 
(3)

 Examples. 

The rules of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples.





Example 1. Fixed annuity. 

X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On December 31, 1995, A is age 60,
has provided services to X as an employee for 20 years, and is a vested participant in X's unfunded nonqualified retirement
plan. Under the plan, A receives $1,000 per month upon retirement until death. The plan provides no additional benefits.
A retires on December 31, 1997, after working for X for 22 years. A at no time is a shareholder of X. X's deductions under
section 404(a)(5) in the recognition period on paying A the $1,000 per month are recognized built-in loss because
all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability
can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period.



Example 2. Increase in annuity for working beyond 20 years.

 The facts are the same as 

Example 1, 

except that under the plan A receives $1,000 per month, plus $100 per month for each year A works for X beyond 20 years,
upon retirement until death. X's deductions on paying A the $1,000 per month are recognized built-in loss. However,
X's deductions on paying A the $200 per month for the two years A worked for X beyond 20 years are not recognized built-in
loss because all events have not occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount
of the liability cannot be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period.



Example 3. Cost of living adjustment. 

The facts are the same as 

Example 1, 

except that under the plan A receives $1,000 per month, plus annual cost of living adjustments, upon retirement until
death. X's deductions under section 404(a)(5) on paying A the $1,000 per month are recognized built-in loss. However,
X's deductions under section 404(a)(5) on paying A the annual cost of living adjustment are not recognized built-in
loss because all events have not occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount
of the liability cannot be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period.




(d) 

Section 481(a) adjustments

_(1) 

In general. 

Any section 481(a) adjustment taken into account in the recognition period is recognized built-in gain or loss to
the extent the adjustment relates to items attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period
under the principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in this section. The principles for determining
recognized built-in gain or loss in this section include, for example, the accrual method rule under paragraph (b)
of this section.

(2) 

Examples. 

The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples.






Example 1. Omitted item attributable to prerecognition period. 

X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. X improperly capitalizes repair
costs and recovers the costs through depreciation of the related assets. In 1999, X properly changes to deducting
repair costs as they are incurred. Under section 481(a), the basis of the related assets are reduced by an amount equal
to the excess of the repair costs incurred before the year of change over the repair costs recovered through depreciation
before the year of change. In addition, X has a negative section 481(a) adjustment equal to the basis reduction. Under
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of X's negative section 481(a) adjustment relating to the repair costs
incurred before the recognition period is recognized built-in loss because those repair costs are items attributable
to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining recognized built-in
gain or loss in this section.
 


Example 2. Duplicated item attributable to prerecognition period. 

Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. Y improperly uses an accrual method
without regard to the economic performance rules of section 461(h) to account for worker's compensation claims.
As a result, Y takes deductions when claims are filed. In 1999, Y properly changes to an accrual method with regard to
the economic performance rules under section 461(h)(2)(C) for worker's compensation claims. As a result, Y takes
deductions when claims are paid. The positive section 481(a) adjustment resulting from the change is equal to the
amount of claims filed, but unpaid, before the year of change. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the deduction
allowed in the recognition period for claims filed, but unpaid, before the recognition period is recognized built-in
loss because a deduction was allowed for those claims before the recognition period under an accrual method without
regard to section 461(h)(2)(C). Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of Y's positive section 481(a)
adjustment relating to claims filed, but unpaid, before the recognition period is recognized built-in gain because
those claims are items attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles
for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in this section.




(e) 

Section 995(b)(2) deemed distributions. 

Any item of income properly taken into account during the recognition period under section 995(b)(2) is recognized
built-in gain if the item results from a DISC termination or disqualification occurring before the beginning of the
recognition period.
(f) 

Discharge of indebtedness and bad debts. 

Any item of income or deduction properly taken into account during the first year of the recognition period as discharge
of indebtedness income under section 61(a)(12) or as a bad debt deduction under section 166 is recognized built-in
gain or loss if the item arises from a debt owed by or to an S corporation at the beginning of the recognition period. 
(g) 

Completion of contract. 

Any item of income properly taken into account during the recognition period under the completed contract method
(as described in  1.451-3(d)) where the corporation began performance of the contract before the beginning
of the recognition period is recognized built-in gain if the item would have been included in gross income before the
beginning of the recognition period under the percentage of completion method (as described in  1.451-3(c)).
Any similar item of deduction is recognized built-in loss if the item would have been allowed as a deduction against
gross income before the beginning of the recognition period under the percentage of completion method.
(h) 

Installment method_

(1) 

In general. 

If a corporation sells an asset before or during the recognition period and reports the income from the sale using the
installment method under section 453 during or after the recognition period, that income is subject to tax under section
1374. 
(2) 

Limitation on amount subject to tax. 

For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the taxable income limitation under  1.1374-2(a)(2)
is equal to the amount by which the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain would have been increased from the
year of the sale to the earlier of the year the income is reported under the installment method or the last year of the
recognition period, assuming all income from the sale had been reported in the year of the sale and all provisions of
section 1374 applied. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the corporation sells the asset before the recognition
period, the income from the sale that is not reported before the recognition period is treated as having been reported
in the first year of the recognition period. 
(3) 

Rollover rule. 

If the limitation in paragraph (h)(2) of this section applies, the excess of the amount reported under the installment
method over the amount subject to tax under the limitation is treated as if it were reported in the succeeding taxable
year(s), but only for succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition period. The amount reported in the succeeding
taxable year(s) under the preceding sentence is reduced to the extent that the amount not subject to tax under the limitation
in paragraph (h)(2) of this section was not subject to tax because the S corporation had an excess of recognized built-in
loss over recognized built-in gain in the taxable year of the sale and succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition
period.

(4) 

Use of losses and section 1374 attributes. 

If income is reported under the installment method by an S corporation for a taxable year after the recognition period
and the income is subject to tax under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the S corporation's section 1374 attributes
may be used to the extent their use is allowed under all applicable provisions of the Code in determining the section
1374 tax. However, the S corporation's loss recognized for a taxable year after the recognition period that would
have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized in the recognition period may not be used in determining
the section 1374 tax.

(5) 

Examples.

 The rules of this paragraph (h)are illustrated by the following examples. 

 




Example 1. Rollover rule. 

X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, X sells Blackacre
with a basis of $0 and a value of $100,000 in exchange for a $100,000 note bearing a market rate of interest payable on
January 1, 2001. X does not make the election under section 453(d) and, therefore, reports the $100,000 gain using
the installment method under section 453. In the year 2001, X has income of $100,000 on collecting the note, unexpired
C year attributes of $0, recognized built-in loss of $0, current losses of $100,000, and taxable income of $0. If X had
reported the $100,000 gain in 1996, X's net recognized built-in gain from 1996 through 2001 would have been $75,000
greater than otherwise. Under paragraph (h) of this section, X has $75,000 net recognized built-in gain subject to
tax under section 1374. X also must treat the $25,000 excess of the amount reported, $100,000, over the amount subject
to tax, $75,000, as income reported under the installment method in the succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition
period, except to the extent X establishes that the $25,000 was not subject to tax under section 1374 in the year 2001
because X had an excess of recognized built-in loss over recognized built-in gain in the taxable year of the sale and
succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition period. 



Example 2. Use of losses. 

Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, Y sells Whiteacre
with a basis of $0 and a value of $250,000 in exchange for a $250,000 note bearing a market rate of interest payable on
January 1, 2006. Y does not make the election under section 453(d) and, therefore, reports the $250,000 gain using
the installment method under section 453. In the year 2006, Y has income of $250,000 on collecting the note, unexpired
C year attributes of $0, loss of $100,000 that would have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized in
the recognition period, current losses of $150,000, and taxable income of $0. If Y had reported the $250,000 gain in
1996, X's net recognized built-in gain from 1996 through 2005 (that is, during the recognition period) would have
been $225,000 greater than otherwise. Under paragraph (h) of this section, X has $225,000 net recognized built-in
gain subject to tax under section 1374. 



Example 3. Use of section 1374 attribute. 

Z is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, Z sells Greenacre
with a basis of $0 and a value of $500,000 in exchange for a $500,000 note bearing a market rate of interest payable on
January 1, 2011. Z does not make the election under section 453(d) and, therefore, reports the $500,000 gain using
the installment method under section 453. In the year 2011, Z has income of $500,000 on collecting the note, loss of
$0 that would have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized in the recognition period, current losses
of $0, taxable income of $500,000, and a minimum tax credit of $60,000 arising in 1995. None of Z's minimum tax credit
is limited under sections 53(c) or 383. If Z had reported the $500,000 gain in 1996, Z's net recognized built-in gain
from 1996 through 2005 (that is, during the recognition period) would have been $350,000 greater than otherwise.
Under paragraph (h) of this section, Z has $350,000 net recognized built-in gain subject to tax under section 1374,
a tentative section 1374 tax of $122,500 ($350,000  x  .35 = $122,500), and a section 1374 tax after using its minimum
tax credit arising in 1995 of $62,250 ($122,500 ^ $60,000 = $62,250).

 


(i) 

Partnership interests_

(1) 

In general. 

If an S corporation owns a partnership interest at the beginning of the recognition period or transfers property to
a partnership in a transaction to which section 1374(d)(6) applies during the recognition period, the S corporation
determines the effect on net recognized built-in gain from its distributive share of partnership items as follows_

<TEXT>
 

(i) Step One: Apply the rules of section 1374(d) to the S corporation's distributive share of partnership items of
income, gain, loss, or deduction included in income or allowed as a deduction under the rules of subchapter K to determine
the extent to which it would have been treated as recognized built-in gain or loss if the partnership items had originated
in and been taken into account directly by the S corporation (partnership 1374 items);
(ii) Step Two: Determine the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain without partnership 1374 items;
(iii) Step Three: Determine the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain with partnership 1374 items; and
(iv) Step Four: If the amount computed under Step Three (paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section) exceeds the amount
computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section), the excess (as limited by paragraph (i)(2)(i) of
this section) is the S corporation's partnership RBIG, and the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain is the
sum of the amount computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section) plus the partnership RBIG. If the
amount computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section) exceeds the amount computed under Step Three
(paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section), the excess (as limited by paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section) is the S
corporation's partnership RBIL, and the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain is the remainder of the amount
computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section) after subtracting the partnership RBIL. 
(2) 

Limitations

_(i) 

Partnership RBIG.

 An S corporation's partnership RBIG for any taxable year may not exceed the excess (if any) of the S corporation's RBIG
limitation over its partnership RBIG for prior taxable years. The preceding sentence does not apply if a corporation
forms or avails of a partnership with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 1374. 
(ii) 

Partnership RBIL.

 An S corporation's partnership RBIL for any taxable year may not exceed the excess (if any) of the S corporation's RBIL
limitation over its partnership RBIL for prior taxable years. 
(3) 

Disposition of partnership interest.

 If an S corporation disposes of its partnership interest, the amount that may be treated as recognized built-in gain
may not exceed the excess (if any) of the S corporation's RBIG limitation over its partnership RBIG during the recognition
period. Similarly, the amount that may be treated as recognized built-in loss may not exceed the excess (if any) of
the S corporation's RBIL limitation over its partnership RBIL during the recognition period.
(4) 

RBIG and RBIL limitations_

(i) 

Sale of partnership interest.

 An S corporation's RBIG or RBIL limitation is the total of the following_
(A) The amount that would be the amount realized if, at the beginning of the first day of the recognition period, the
corporation had remained a C corporation and had sold its partnership interest (and any assets the corporation contributed
to the partnership during the recognition period) at fair market value to an unrelated party; decreased by 
(B) The corporation's adjusted basis in the partnership interest (and any assets the corporation contributed to
the partnership during the recognition period) at the time of the sale referred to in paragraph (i)(4)(i)(A) of this
section; and increased or decreased by 
(C) The corporation's allocable share of the partnership's section 481(a) adjustments at the time of the sale referred
to in paragraph (i)(4)(i)(A) of this section. 
(ii) 

Amounts of limitations.

 If the result in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section is a positive amount, the S corporation has a RBIG limitation equal
to that amount and a RBIL limitation of $0, but if the result in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section is a negative amount,
the S corporation has a RBIL limitation equal to that amount and a RBIG limitation of $0. 
(5) 

Small interest exception

_(i) 

In general.

 Paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not apply to a taxable year in the recognition period if the S corporation's partnership
interest represents less than 10 percent of the partnership's capital and profits at all times during the taxable
year and prior taxable years in the recognition period, and the fair market value of the S corporation's partnership
interest as of the beginning of the recognition period is less than $100,000.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Contributed assets.

 For purposes of paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section, if the S corporation contributes any assets to the partnership
during the recognition period and the S corporation held the assets as of the beginning of the recognition period,
the fair market value of the S corporation's partnership interest as of the beginning of the recognition period is
determined as if the assets were contributed to the partnership before the beginning of the recognition period (using
the fair market value of each contributed asset as of the beginning of the recognition period). The contribution does
not affect whether paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section applies for taxable years in the recognition period before
the taxable year in which the contribution was made.
(iii) 

Anti-abuse rule.

 Paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section does not apply if a corporation forms or avails of a partnership with a principal
purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 1374. 
(6) 

Section 704(c) gain or loss.

 Solely for purposes of section 1374, an S corporation's section 704(c) gain or loss amount with respect to any asset
is not reduced during the recognition period, except for amounts treated as recognized built-in gain or loss with
respect to that asset under this paragraph.
(7) 

Disposition of distributed partnership asset.

 If on the first day of the recognition period an S corporation holds an interest in a partnership that holds an asset
and during the recognition period the partnership distributes the asset to the S corporation that thereafter disposes
of the asset, the asset is treated as having been held by the S corporation on the first day of the recognition period
and as having the fair market value and adjusted basis in the hands of the S corporation that it had in the hands of the
partnership on that day. 
(8) 

Examples.

 The rules of this paragraph (i) are illustrated by the following examples.





Example 1. Pre-conversion partnership interest.

 X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P and P owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $25,000 and a value of $45,000. In 1996, P buys
Whiteacre for $50,000. In 1999, P sells Blackacre for $55,000 and recognizes a gain of $30,000 of which $15,000 is included
in X's distributive share. P also sells Whiteacre in 1999 for $42,000 and recognizes a loss of $8,000 of which $4,000
is included in X's distributive share. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(3), X's $15,000 gain is presumed
to be recognized built-in gain and thus treated as a partnership 1374 item, but this presumption is rebutted if X establishes
that P's gain would have been only $20,000 ($45,000^$25,000=$20,000) if Blackacre had been sold on the first day of
the recognition period. In such a case, only X's distributive share of the $20,000 built-in gain, $10,000, would be
treated as a partnership 1374 item. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(4), X's $4,000 loss is not treated as
a partnership 1374 item because P did not hold Whiteacre on the first day of the recognition period.


Example 2. Post-conversion contribution.

 Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y owns (among other assets)
Blackacre with a basis of $100,000 and a value of $200,000. On January 1, 1998, when Blackacre has a basis of $100,000
and a value of $200,000, Y contributes Blackacre to partnership P for a 50 percent interest in P. On January 1, 2000,
P sells Blackacre for $300,000 and recognizes a gain of $200,000 on the sale ($300,000^$100,000=$200,000). P is allocated
$100,000 of the gain under section 704(c), and another $50,000 of the gain for its fifty percent share of the remainder,
for a total of $150,000. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(3), if Y establishes that P's gain would have been
only $100,000 ($200,000^$100,000=$100,000) if Blackacre had been sold on the first day of the recognition period,
Y would treat only $100,000 as a partnership 1374 item. 


Example 3. RBIG limitation of $100,000 or $50,000.

 X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $100,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre
with a basis of $50,000 and a value of $200,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $200,000 and recognizes a gain of $150,000
of which $75,000 is included in X's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. X's net recognized built-in
gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $35,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $110,000. Thus,
X has a partnership RBIG of $75,000 except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. Because X's RBIG limitation
is $100,000, X's partnership RBIG of $75,000 is not limited and X's net recognized built-in gain for the year is $110,000
($35,000+$75,000=$110,000). However, if X had a RBIG limitation of $50,000 instead of $100,000, X's partnership
RBIG would be limited to $50,000 under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and X's net recognized built-in gain would
be $85,000 ($35,000+$50,000=$85,000). 


Example 4. RBIL limitation of $60,000 or $40,000.

 Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $0 and a RBIL limitation of $60,000. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre
with a basis of $225,000 and a value of $125,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $125,000 and recognizes a loss of $100,000
of which $50,000 is included in Y's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. Y's net recognized built-in
gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $75,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $25,000. Thus,
Y has a partnership RBIL of $50,000 for the year except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section. Because
Y's RBIL limitation is $60,000, Y's partnership RBIL for the year is not limited and Y's net recognized built-in gain
for the year is $25,000 ($75,000^$50,000=$25,000). However, if Y had a RBIL limitation of $40,000 instead of $60,000,
Y's partnership RBIL would be limited to $40,000 under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section and Y's net recognized
built-in gain for the year would be $35,000 ($75,000^$40,000=$35,000).


Example 5. RBIG limitation of $0.

 (i) X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. X owns a 50 percent interest in partnership
P with a RBIG limitation of $0 and a RBIL limitation of $25,000. 
(a) In 1996, P's partnership 1374 items are_

(1) Ordinary income of $25,000; and 
(2) Capital gain of $75,000. 

(b) X itself has_ 

(1) Recognized built-in ordinary income of $40,000; and 
(2) Recognized built-in capital loss of $90,000. 

(ii) X's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $40,000 and with partnership
1374 items is $65,000 ($40,000+$25,000=$65,000). Thus, X's partnership RBIG is $25,000 for the year except as limited
under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. Because X's RBIG limitation is $0, X's partnership RBIG of $25,000 is limited
to $0 and X's net recognized built-in gain for the year is $40,000.



Example 6. RBIL limitation of $0. 

(i) Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. Y owns a 50 percent interest in partnership
P with a RBIG limitation of $60,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0. 

(a) In 1996, P's partnership 1374 items are_


(1) Ordinary income of $25,000; and 
(2) Capital loss of $90,000. 

(b) Y itself has_ 

(1) recognized built-in ordinary income of $40,000; and 
(2) recognized built-in capital gain of $75,000. 

(ii) Y's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $115,000 ($40,000+$75,000=$115,000)
and with partnership 1374 items is $65,000 ($40,000+$25,000=$65,000). Thus, Y's partnership RBIL is $50,000 for
the year except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section. Because Y's RBIL limitation is $0, Y's partnership
RBIL of $50,000 is limited to $0 and Y's net recognized built-in gain is $115,000.



Example 7. Disposition of partnership interest. 

X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $200,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre
with a basis of $20,000 and a value of $140,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $140,000 and recognizes a gain of $120,000
of which $60,000 is included in X's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. X's net recognized built-in
gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $95,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $155,000. Thus,
X has a partnership RBIG of $60,000. In 1999, X sells its entire interest in P for $350,000 and recognizes a gain of $250,000.
Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, X's recognized built-in gain on the sale is limited by its RBIG limitation
to $140,000 ($200,000^$60,000=$140,000).



Example 8. Section 704(c) case. 

Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y contributes Asset 1, 5-year
property with a value of $40,000 and a basis of $0, and an unrelated party contributes $40,000 in cash, each for a 50 percent
interest in partnership P. The partnership adopts the traditional method under  1.704-3(b). If P sold
Asset 1 for $40,000 immediately after it was contributed by Y, P's $40,000 gain would be allocated to Y under section
704(c). Instead, Asset 1 is sold by P in 1999 for $36,000 and P recognizes gain of $36,000 ($36,000^$0=$36,000) on the
sale. However, because book depreciation of $8,000 per year has been taken on Asset 1 in 1996, 1997, and 1998, Y is allocated
only $16,000 of P's $36,000 gain ($40,000^(3 x $8,000)=($16,000^$0)=$16,000) under section 704(c). The
remaining $20,000 of P's $36,000 gain ($36,000^$16,000=$20,000) is allocated 50 percent to each partner under section
704(b). Thus, a total of $26,000 ($16,000+$10,000=$26,000) of P's $36,000 gain is allocated to Y. However, under
paragraph (i)(6) of this section, Y treats $36,000 as a partnership 1374 item on P's sale of Asset 1.



Example 9. Disposition of distributed partnership asset. 

X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a fifty percent interest
in partnership P and P owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $20,000 and a value of $40,000. On January
1, 1998, P distributes Blackacre to X, when Blackacre has a basis of $20,000 and a value of $50,000. Under section 732(a)(1),
X has a transferred basis of $20,000 in Blackacre. On January 1, 1999, X sells Blackacre for $60,000 and recognizes
a gain of $40,000. Under paragraph (i)(7) of this section and section 1374(d)(3), X has recognized built-in gain from
the sale of $20,000, the amount of built-in gain in Blackacre on the first day of the recognition period. 



 1.1374-5 

Loss carryforwards.


(a) 

In general. 

The loss carryforwards allowed as deductions against net recognized built-in gain under section 1374(b)(2) are
allowed only to the extent their use is allowed under the rules applying to C corporations. Any other loss carryforwards,
such as charitable contribution carryforwards under section 170(d)(2), are not allowed as deductions against net
recognized built-in gain.
(b) 

Example. 

The rules of this section are illustrated by the following example.





Example. Section 382 limitation. 

X is a C corporation that has an ownership change under section 382(g)(1) on 
January 1, 1994. On that date, X has a fair market value of $500,000, NOL carryforwards of $400,000, and a net unrealized
built-in gain under section 382(h)(3)(A) of $0. Assume X's section 382 limitation under section 382(b)(1) is $40,000.
X elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1998. On that date, X has NOL carryforwards of $240,000 (having used
$160,000 of its pre-change net operating losses in its 4 preceding taxable years) and a section 1374 net unrealized
built-in gain of $250,000. In 1998, X has net recognized built-in gain of $100,000. X may use $40,000 of its NOL carryforwards
as a deduction against its $100,000 net recognized built-in gain, because X's section 382 limitation is $40,000.



 1.1374-6 

Credits and credit carryforwards.



(a) 

In general. 

The credits and credit carryforwards allowed as credits against the section 1374 tax under section 1374(b)(3) are
allowed only to the extent their use is allowed under the rules applying to C corporations. Any other credits or credit
carryforwards, such as foreign tax credits under section 901, are not allowed as credits against the section 1374
tax.

(b) 

Limitations. 

The amount of business credit carryforwards and minimum tax credit allowed against the section 1374 tax are subject
to the limitations described in section 38(c) and section 53(c), respectively, as modified by this paragraph. The
tentative tax determined under paragraph (a)(3) of  1.1374-1 is treated as the regular tax liability
described in sections 38(c)(1) and 53(c)(1), and as the net income tax and net regular tax liability described in section
38(c)(1). The tentative minimum tax described in section 55(b) is determined using the rate of tax applicable to corporations
and without regard to any alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit described in that section and by treating the
net recognized built-in gain determined under  1.1374-2, modified to take into account the adjustments
of sections 56 and 58 applicable to corporations and the preferences of section 57, as the alternative minimum taxable
income described in section 55(b)(2).
(c) 

Examples. 

The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples.






Example 1. Business credit carryforward. 

X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, X has a $500,000 business
credit carryforward from a C year and Asset 

#

1 with a fair market value of $400,000, a basis for regular tax purposes of $95,000, and a basis for alternative minimum
tax purposes of $150,000. In 1996, X has net recognized built-in gain of $305,000 from selling Asset 

#

1 for $400,000. Thus, X's tentative tax under paragraph (a)(3) of  1.1374-1 and regular tax liability
under paragraph (b) of this section is $106,750 ($400,000^$95,000=$305,000  x  .35= $106,750, assuming a 35
percent tax rate). Also, X's tentative minimum tax determined under paragraph (b) of this section is $47,000 [$400,000^$150,000=$250,000^$15,000
($40,000 corporate exemption amount ^$25,000 phase-out=$15,000)=$235,000  x  .20=$47,000, assuming a 20
percent tax rate]. Thus, the business credit limitation under section 38(c) is $59,750 [$106,750^$47,000 (the greater
of $47,000 or $20,438 (.25 x $81,750 ($106,750^$25,000=$81,750))) = $59,750]. As a result, X's section 1374 tax is
$47,000 ($106,750^$59,750= $47,000) for 1996 and X has $440,250 ($500,000^$59,750 = $440,250) of business credit
carryforwards for succeeding taxable years. 



Example 2. Minimum tax credit. 

Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, Asset

#

1 has a fair market value of $5,000,000, a basis for regular tax purposes of $4,000,000, and a basis for alternative
minimum tax purposes of $4,750,000. Y also has a minimum tax credit of $310,000 from 1995. Y has no other assets, no net
operating or capital loss carryforwards, and no business credit carryforwards. In 1996, Y's only transaction is
the sale of Asset #1 for $5,000,000. Therefore, Y has net recognized built-in gain in 1996 of $1,000,000 ($5,000,000^$4,000,000=$1,000,000)
and a tentative tax under paragraph (a)(3) of  1.1374-1 of $350,000 ($1,000,000 x .35=$350,000,
assuming a 35 percent tax rate). Also, Y's tentative minimum tax determined under paragraph (b) of this section is
$47,000 [$5,000,000^$4,750,000=$250,000^$15,000 ($40,000 corporate exemption amount ^$25,000 phase-out =
$15,000) = $235,000 x .20 = $47,000, assuming a 20 percent tax rate]. Thus, Y may use its minimum tax credit in
the amount of $303,000 ($350,000^$47,000=$303,000) to offset its section 1374 tentative tax. As a result, Y's section
1374 tax is $47,000 ($350,000^$303,000=$47,000) in 1996 and Y has a minimum tax credit attributable to years for which
Y was a C corporation of $7,000 ($310,000^$303,000=$7,000). 



 1.1374-7 

Inventory.



(a) 

Valuation. 

The fair market value of the inventory of an S corporation on the first day of the recognition period equals the amount
that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the inventory in a purchase of all the S corporation's assets by a
buyer that expects to continue to operate the S corporation's business. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the
buyer and seller are presumed not to be under any compulsion to buy or sell and to have reasonable knowledge of all relevant
facts.

(b) 

Identity of dispositions. 

The inventory method used by an S corporation for tax purposes must be used to identify whether the inventory it disposes
of during the recognition period is inventory it held on the first day of that period. Thus, a corporation using the
LIFO method does not dispose of inventory it held on the first day of the recognition period unless the carrying value
of its inventory for a taxable year during that period is less than the carrying value of its inventory on the first day
of the recognition period (determined using the LIFO method as described in section 472). However, if a corporation
changes its method of accounting for inventory (for example, from the FIFO method to the LIFO method or from the LIFO
method to the FIFO method) with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 1374, it must use its former
method to identify its dispositions of inventory. 



 1.1374-8 


Section 1374(d)(8) transactions. 



(a)


In general. 

If any S corporation acquires any asset in a transaction in which the S corporation's basis in the asset is determined
(in whole or in part) by reference to a C corporation's basis in the assets (or any other property) (a section 1374(d)(8)
transaction), section 1374 applies to the net recognized built-in gain attributable to the assets acquired in any
section 1374(d)(8) transaction.
 

(b) 

Separate determination of tax. 

For purposes of the tax imposed under section 1374(d)(8), a separate determination of tax is made with respect to the
assets the S corporation acquires in one section 1374(d)(8) transaction from the assets the S corporation acquires
in another section 1374(d)(8) transaction and from the assets the corporation held when it became an S corporation.
Thus, an S corporation's section 1374 attributes when it became an S corporation may only be used to reduce the section
1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets the S corporation held at that time. Similarly, an S corporation's section
1374 attributes acquired in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction may only be used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed
on dispositions of assets the S corporation acquired in the same transaction. 

(c)


Taxable income limitation. 

For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an S corporation's taxable income limitation under  1.1374-2(a)(2)
for any taxable year is allocated between or among each of the S corporation's separate determinations of net recognized
built-in gain for that year (determined without regard to the taxable income limitation) based on the ratio of each
of those determinations to the sum of all of those determinations. 

(d) 

Examples. 

The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples. 






Example 1. Separate determination of tax. 

(i) X is a C corporation that elected to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1986 (before section 1374 was amended
in the Tax Reform Act of 1986). X has a net operating loss carryforward of $20,000 arising in 1985 when X was a C corporation.
On January 1, 1996, Y (an unrelated C corporation) merges into X in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(A) applies.
Y has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards. The assets X acquired from Y are subject to tax under
section 1374 and have a net unrealized built-in gain of $150,000. 

(ii) In 1996, X has a pre-limitation amount of $50,000 on dispositions of assets acquired from Y and a taxable income
limitation of $100,000 (because only one group of assets is subject to section 1374, there is no allocation of the taxable
income limitation). As a result, X has a net recognized built-in gain on those assets of $50,000. X's $20,000 net operating
loss carryforward may not be used as a deduction against its $50,000 net recognized built-in gain on the assets X acquired
from Y. Therefore, X has a section 1374 tax of $17,500 ($50,000  x  .35 = $17,500, assuming a 35 percent tax rate)
for its 1996 taxable year.

Example 2. Allocation of taxable income limitation. 

(i) Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. The assets Y holds when it becomes
an S corporation have a net unrealized built-in gain of $5,000. Y has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards.
On January 1, 1997, Z (an unrelated C corporation) merges into Y in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(A) applies.
Z has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards. The assets Y acquired from Z are subject to tax under
section 1374 and have a net unrealized built-in gain of $80,000. 

(ii) In 1997, Y has a pre-limitation amount on the assets it held when it became an S corporation of $15,000, a pre-limitation
amount on the assets Y acquired from Z of $15,000, and a taxable income limitation of $10,000. However, because the
assets Y held on becoming an S corporation have a net unrealized built-in gain of $5,000, its net recognized built-in
gain on those assets is limited to $5,000 before taking into account the taxable income limitation. Y's taxable income
limitation of $10,000 is allocated between the assets Y held on becoming an S corporation and the assets Y acquired
from Z for purposes of determining the net recognized built-in gain from each pool of assets. Thus, Y's net recognized
built-in gain on the assets Y held on becoming an S corporation is $2,500 [$10,000  x  ($5,000/$20,000) = $2,500].
Y's net recognized built-in gain on the assets Y acquired from Z is $7,500 [$10,000  x  ($15,000/$20,000) = $7,500].
Therefore, Y has a section 1374 tax of $3,500 [($2,500 + $7,500)  x  .35 = $3,500, assuming a 35 percent tax rate]
for its 1997 taxable year. 



 1.1374-9 


Anti-stuffing rule.




If a corporation acquires an asset before or during the recognition period with a principal purpose of avoiding the
tax imposed under section 1374, the asset and any loss, deduction, loss carryforward, credit, or credit carryforward
attributable to the asset is disregarded in determining the S corporation's pre-limitation amount, taxable income
limitation, net unrealized built-in gain limitation, deductions against net recognized built-in gain, and credits
against the section 1374 tax. 



 1.1374-10 


Effective date and additional rules. 



(a) 

In general. 

Sections 1.1374-1 through 1.1374-9 apply for taxable years ending on or after December 27, 1994, but only
in cases where the S corporation's return for the taxable year is filed pursuant to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8)
transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994. 

(b) 

Additional rules. 

This paragraph (b) provides rules applicable to certain S corporations, assets, or transactions to which   1.1374-1
through 1.1374-9 do not apply. 

(1) 

Certain transfers to partnerships. 

If a corporation transfers an asset to a partnership in a transaction to which section 721(a) applies and the transfer
is made in contemplation of an S election or during the recognition period, section 1374 applies on a disposition of
the asset by the partnership as if the S corporation had disposed of the asset itself. This paragraph (b)(1) applies
as of the effective date of section 1374, unless the recognition period with respect to the contributed asset is pursuant
to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994. 

(2) 

Certain inventory dispositions. 

For purposes of section 1374(d)(2)(A), the inventory method used by the taxpayer for tax purposes (FIFO, LIFO, etc.)
must be used to identify whether goods disposed of following conversion to S corporation status were held by the corporation
at the time of conversion. Thus, for example, a corporation using the LIFO inventory method will not be subject to the
built-in gain tax with respect to sales of inventory except to the extent that a LIFO layer existing prior to the beginning
of the first taxable year as an S corporation is invaded after the beginning of that year. This paragraph (b)(2) applies
as of the effective date of section 1374, unless the recognition period with respect to the inventory is pursuant to
an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994.

(3) 

Certain contributions of built-in loss assets. 

If a built-in loss asset (that is, an asset with an adjusted tax basis in excess of its fair market value) is contributed
to a corporation within 2 years before the earlier of the beginning of its first taxable year as an S corporation, or
the filing of its S election, the loss inherent in the asset will not reduce net unrealized built-in gain, as defined
in section 1374(d)(1), unless the taxpayer demonstrates a clear and substantial relationship between the contributed
property and the conduct of the corporation's current or future business enterprises. This paragraph (b)(3) applies
as of the effective date of section 1374, unless the recognition period with respect to the contributed asset is pursuant
to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994.

(4) 

Certain installment sales_

(i) 

In general. 

If a taxpayer sells an asset either prior to or during the recognition period and recognizes income either during or
after the recognition period from the sale under the installment method, the income will, when recognized, be taxed
under section 1374 to the extent it would have been so taxed in prior taxable years if the selling corporation had made
the election under section 453(d) not to report the income under the installment method. For purposes of determining
the extent to which the income would have been subject to tax if the section 453(d) election had not been made, the taxable
income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) and the built-in gain carryover rule of section 1374(d)(2)(B) will
be taken into account. This paragraph (b)(4) applies for installment sales occurring on or after March 26, 1990, and
before December 27, 1994.

(ii) 

Examples. 

The rules of this paragraph (b)(4) are illustrated by the following examples.








Example 1. 

In year 1 of the recognition period under section 1374, a corporation realizes a gain of $100,000 on the sale of an asset
with built-in gain. The corporation is to receive full payment for the asset in year 11. Because the corporation does
not make an election under section 453(d), all $100,000 of the gain from the sale is reported under the installment
method in year 11. If the corporation had made an election under section 453(d) with respect to the sale, the gain would
have been recognized in year 1 and, taking into account the corporation's income and gains from other sources, application
of the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) and the built-in gain carryover rule of section 1374(d)(2)(B)
would have resulted in $40,000 of the gain being subject to tax during the recognition period under section 1374. Therefore,
$40,000 of the gain recognized in year 11 is subject to tax under section 1374.




Example 2. 

In year 1 of the recognition period under section 1374, a corporation realizes a gain of $100,000 on the sale of an asset
with built-in gain. The corporation is to receive full payment for the asset in year 6. Because the corporation does
not make an election under section 453(d), all $100,000 of the gain from the sale is reported under the installment
method in year 6. If the corporation had made an election under section 453(d) with respect to the sale, the gain would
have been recognized in year 1 and, taking into account the corporation's income and gains from other sources, application
of the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) and the built-in gain carryover rule of section 1374(d)(2)(B)
would have resulted in all of the gain being subjected to tax under section 1374 in years 1 through 5. Therefore, notwithstanding
that the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) might otherwise limit the taxation of the gain recognized
in year 6, the entire $100,000 of gain will be subject to tax under section 1374 when it is recognized in year 6.

Disposition of an Interest in a Nuclear Power Plant 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations relating to certain Federal income tax consequences of a disposition of
an interest in a nuclear power plant by a taxpayer that has maintained a nuclear decommissioning fund with respect
to that plant. These regulations affect taxpayers that transfer or acquire interests in nuclear power plants by providing
guidance on the tax consequences of these transfers. In addition, the final regulations extend the benefits of section
468A to electing taxpayers with an interest in a nuclear power plant under the jurisdiction of the Rural Electrification
Administration. The regulations also make a number of other changes and clarifications to the existing regulations
to aid in the administration of section 468A. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act 



The collections of information contained in these final regulations have been reviewed and approved by the Office
of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number
1545-1378. With respect to  1.468A-3(h)(2) (xii) and (xiii), the estimated annual burden per respondent
varies from 1 to 2 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 1.5 hours. 

With respect to  1.468A-3(i)(1)(ii)(B), the estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 20 to
30 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 25 hours. 

Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be directed
to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office
of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. 



Background 



This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR parts 1 and 602) under section 468A. Section
468A, relating to nuclear decommissioning costs, was added to the Internal Revenue Code by section 91(c) of the Tax
Reform Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 604). On November 20, 1992, the IRS published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of proposed rulemaking (57 FR 54734) setting forth proposed amendments to the regulations under section
468A. 

Section 468A(c)(1)(B) authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations that prescribe the extent to which a taxpayer
must include amounts from a nuclear decommissioning fund (a Fund) in gross income upon the disposition of an interest
in a nuclear power plant to which the Fund relates. Section 1.468A-6T (TD 8094, 51 FR 25033) published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 10, 1986, treated such a disposition as a taxable distribution of assets in the Fund to the taxpayer transferring
the interest. In response to generally adverse comments on this rule, final regulations (TD 8184, 53 FR 6800) published
in the 

Federal Register

 on March 3, 1988, stated that guidance on the tax treatment of these dispositions would be provided at a later date.
These regulations are issued to provide this guidance.

Explanation of Provisions


In General


The regulations prescribe certain federal income tax consequences of the disposition of all or a portion of a qualifying
interest in a nuclear power plant to which a Fund relates. The regulations treat a transfer of Fund assets in connection
with such a disposition as a nonrecognition event, provided certain requirements are satisfied. The transferee
of the interest is viewed as stepping into the shoes of the transferor with respect to the amount of the assets in the
transferor's Fund that is proportionate to the interest transferred and with respect to the transferor's ruling
amount for the portion of the taxable year that follows the disposition. These regulations also provide rules for
the calculation of schedules of ruling amounts for the transferee and for a transferor that retains a portion of its
original qualifying interest.
The regulations also contain a general provision allowing the IRS to treat a disposition occurring on or after December
27, 1994 as satisfying the requirements of the regulations if the IRS decides that this treatment is necessary or appropriate
to carry out the purposes of section 468A and the regulations thereunder. Another provision allows the IRS, upon the
request of an electing taxpayer, to apply these regulations to a disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant
occurring after July 17, 1984, and before December 27, 1994.
The regulations also allow rural electric cooperatives to qualify as electing taxpayers; modify the information
requirements that are part of a request for a schedule of ruling amounts; create a new mandatory review period for schedules
of ruling amounts determined with respect to a disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant; require that the
trust agreement for each Fund contain a provision that assets of the Fund may be used only in a manner that is authorized
by section 468A and the regulations thereunder; and provide that the period within which a taxpayer must substantially
comply with the provisions requiring information to be submitted as part of a request for a schedule of ruling amounts
is the general period applicable to requests for private letter rulings.


Comments Received


Comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking (57 FR 54734) can be divided into five general categories_rural
electric cooperatives, reduction in time to provide additional information, trust provisions, disposition provisions,
and self-dealing rules.


Rural Electric Cooperatives


The proposed regulations extend the benefits of section 468A to electing rural electric cooperatives. One commentator
requested that the IRS (1) not consider earnings on assets in Funds when determining whether tax-exempt rural electric
cooperatives satisfy the 85 percent test of section 501(c)(12) (which requires at least 85 percent of the cooperative's
income to be from members); (2) specify the regulatory authority (Rural Electrification Administration, Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, or State Commission) that is charged with approving cost of service amounts; and (3)
allow rural electric cooperatives to elect to apply section 468A retroactively for all open taxable years.
The determination of whether earnings on nuclear decommissioning funds (whether or not established under section
468A) count toward satisfaction of the 85 percent test is an issue under section 501 and, therefore, is outside the
scope of this project. Further, it is the responsibility of the regulatory authorities to decide which of the authorities
is responsible for approving cost of service amounts. These issues, therefore, are not addressed in the final regulations.
Additionally, because sections 468A (a) and (g) require that payments to a Fund for a taxable year be made no later than
two and one-half months after the close of that year, the IRS believes that retroactive application of section 468A
to rural electric cooperatives is not permitted by the statute.


Time Period for Additional Information


The proposed regulations also reduce the time for submitting additional information requested by the IRS concerning
a request for a schedule of ruling amounts from 60 to 30 days. Many commentators stated that the abbreviated response
time would be inadequate for a taxpayer to gather, prepare, and submit requested information. Retaining the requirements
of the proposed regulations, the final regulations merely conform the section 468A rules to the normal rules governing
requests for letter rulings to help expedite the rulings process. The final regulations clarify, however, that the
IRS may waive this deadline if the taxpayer is making a good faith effort to comply with the deadline.

Trust Provisions


The proposed regulations also provide that each qualified nuclear decommissioning trust agreement must require
that assets of the Fund be used as authorized by section 468A and the regulations thereunder and that the agreement
cannot be amended to violate section 468A or the regulations thereunder. Commentators argued that this provision
exceeds the IRS's authority. It is apparent from section 468A(e)(4) (which requires that amounts in a Fund be used
exclusively for decommissioning, associated expenses, or, when not currently needed for those purposes, to make
investments) and from the special section 468A tax rules (including the preferential tax rates on Fund earnings for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993), that Congress intended for amounts set aside in these Funds to be
available for decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The IRS believes it is consistent with this Congressional
intent, and with the IRS's responsibilities for successfully administering the program, to require that the trust
agreements limit use of Fund assets to section 468A purposes. Accordingly, the final regulations retain this requirement.
To ensure that taxpayers have sufficient time to modify their trust agreements, the final regulations also retain
the grace period of the proposed regulations that allows until December 31, 1996, for the inclusion of the required
trust provisions.


Dispositions of an Interest in a Nuclear Power Plant


The proposed regulations generally treat transfers of assets in Funds resulting from transfers of interests in nuclear
power plants to which the Funds relate as nonrecognition, transferred basis transactions. Most of the comments favored
the proposed rules. However, commentators requested (1) additional guidance on how to determine which Fund assets
relate to a transferred interest in a nuclear power plant and clarification that the regulations were not adopting
a tracing approach; (2) an option to treat these dispositions as triggering a taxable transfer of related assets;
(3) an option to transfer an entire Fund rather than the assets in the Fund; and (4) assurance that the proposed rules
apply in the context of corporate reorganizations.
First, to make clear that the regulations do not adopt a tracing approach, the final regulations refer to assets in
a Fund that are proportionate to the interest in the plant that is transferred, rather than to assets that ``relate''
to the interest transferred. The final regulations also clarify that a proportionate amount of the assets in a Fund
is considered transferred if, on the date the qualifying interest is transferred, the percentage of the aggregate
fair market value of the assets transferred equals the percentage of the qualifying interest transferred.
Second, the final regulations do not adopt the suggestion to provide taxpayers with an option to treat the disposition
as triggering a taxable transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets. The nonrecognition, transferred basis
approach simplifies the tax rules for dispositions and corresponds to the substance of these transactions. Permitting
taxpayers to elect taxable treatment would unnecessarily complicate the tax rules.
Third, to minimize the role of form in these disposition transactions, the final regulations clarify that when an
interest in a nuclear power plant is transferred, the associated assets must be transferred to a Fund of the transferee
or, if the transferee acquires the transferor's entire interest in the plant, the transferor's Fund may be transferred
to the transferee. Such a transfer of the transferor's Fund must not be prohibited by the transferor's trust agreement
or applicable local law. Regardless of whether the assets of the transferor's Fund or the Fund itself is transferred,
after the transfer, the transferee must not violate  1.468A-5(a)(1)(ii), which requires that an electing
taxpayer maintain only one Fund for each nuclear power plant. Similarly, after the transfer, the transferee and the
transferor that retains an interest must not violate  1.468A-5(a)(1)(ii), which requires that each
electing taxpayer have a separate Fund for its interest in the same plant.

In addition, the final regulations provide that if a 
transferee acquires an interest in a nuclear power plant in 
a transaction to which  1.468A-6 (dispositions of an 
interest in a nuclear power plant) applies, the transferee's 
qualifying percentage for the interest acquired generally is 
the transferor's qualifying percentage with respect to that 
interest immediately before the disposition. 
Fourth, although the final regulations make no specific 
mention of corporate reorganizations, they apply to all 
dispositions described in the regulations, including those 
that occur in the context of corporate reorganizations. 


Self-Dealing 


The proposed regulations also make a change to the rules 
prohibiting a trustee or other disqualified person from 
engaging in an act of self-dealing with a Fund. The change 
excepts deposits in trustee institutions from the self- 
dealing rules if the deposits are made to facilitate 
temporary investments or the payment of reasonable 
administrative expenses. The change was intended to reduce 
administrative costs associated with establishing an account 
with a different institution for these purposes. 
Commentators criticized the rule on the ground that it 
called into question the permissibility of using Fund assets 
to pay investment advisory and trustee fees. In response to 
these comments, the final regulations provide that the 
proposed exception to the self-dealing rules is an addition 
to, rather than a substitution for, the existing exception 
for payment of fees. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not 
a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. 
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also 
has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply 
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 
7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed 
rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the 
Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
small business. 


Drafting Information 


The principal author of these regulations is Peter C. 
Friedman, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs 
and Special Industries). However, other personnel from the 
IRS and Treasury Department participated in their 
development.

(4) The term 

nuclear power plant 

means any nuclear 
power reactor that is used predominantly in the trade or 
business of the furnishing or sale of electric energy, if 
the rates for the furnishing or sale, as the case may be, 
either have been established or approved by a public utility 
commission or are under the jurisdiction of the Rural 
Electrification Administration. Each unit (i.e., nuclear 
reactor) located on a multi-unit site is a separate nuclear 
power plant. The term 

nuclear power plant

 also includes 
the portion of the common facilities of a multi-unit site 
allocable to a unit on that site.

(d) 

Special rules for electing taxpayers whose rates are under the jurisdiction of the Rural Electrification Administration.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the regulations under section 468A, a schedule of ruling amounts may be provided
to a taxpayer with respect to a nuclear power plant if the rates for the furnishing or sale of the plant's electricity
are under the jurisdiction of the Rural Electrification Administration. This schedule will be determined on the
basis of all facts and circumstances in a manner consistent with section 468A. No taxpayer will be provided a schedule
of ruling amounts under section 468A for any taxable year unless the portion of the rates attributable to the decommissioning
costs of that taxpayer with respect to such taxable year are treated by the taxpayer as though they were subject to section
88. 



Par. 4. 

Section 1.468A-3 is amended as follows: 

1. Paragraph (h)(1)(v) is removed. 

2. Paragraphs (h)(1)(vi) through (h)(1)(viii) are redesignated as paragraphs (h)(1)(v) through (h)(1)(vii),

with the requirements of this paragraph (h) are provided to the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days after this
notification, the request will be considered filed on the date of the original submission. If the information or materials
necessary to comply substantially with the requirements of this paragraph (h) are not provided within 30 days after
this notification, the request will be considered filed on the date that all information or materials necessary to
comply with the requirements of this paragraph (h) are provided. 

(B) The Internal Revenue Service may waive the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(vii)(A) of this section if the Service
determines that the electing taxpayer is making a good faith effort to comply with the deadline and if the waiver is
consistent with the purposes of section 468A.

Par. 6. 

Section 1.468A-6 is amended by adding text to 
read as follows: 


 1.468A-6 


Disposition of an interest in a nuclear power 
plant.


(a) 

In general

. This section describes the federal 
income tax consequences of a transfer of the assets of a 
nuclear decommissioning fund (Fund) within the meaning of 
 1.468A-1(b)(3) in connection with a sale, exchange, or 
other disposition by a taxpayer (transferor) of all or a 
portion of its qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant 
to another taxpayer (transferee). This section also 
explains how a schedule of ruling amounts will be determined 
for the transferor and transferee. 
(b) 

Requirements

. This section applies if_ 
(1) Immediately before the disposition, the transferor 
maintained a Fund with respect to the interest disposed of; 
and 
(2) Immediately after the disposition_ 
(i) The transferee maintains a Fund with respect to the 
interest acquired; 
(ii) The interest acquired is a qualifying interest of 
the transferee in the nuclear power plant; 
(iii) Either a proportionate amount (which could include 
all) of the assets of the transferor's Fund is transferred 
to a Fund of the transferee, or the transferor's entire Fund 
is transferred to the transferee, provided in the latter 
case (or if the transferee receives all of the assets in the 
transferor's Fund, but not the transferor's Fund) that the 
transferee acquires the transferor's entire qualifying 
interest in the plant; and 
(iv) The transferee continues to satisfy the requirements 
of  1.468A-5(a)(iii), which permits an electing taxpayer to 
maintain only one Fund for each plant. 
(c) 

Tax consequences

. A disposition that satisfies the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section will have the 
following tax consequences at the time it occurs:

<PARENT> FR941227-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) 

The transferor and its Fund. 

Neither the transferor 
nor the transferor's Fund will recognize gain or loss or 
otherwise take any income or deduction into account by 
reason of the transfer of a proportionate amount of the 
assets of the transferor's Fund to the transferee's Fund (or 
by reason of the transfer of the transferor's entire Fund to 
the transferee). For purposes of the regulations under 
section 468A, this transfer (or the transfer of the 
transferor's Fund) will not be considered a distribution of 
assets by the transferor's Fund. 
(2) 

The transferee and its Fund. 

Neither the transferee 
nor the transferee's Fund will recognize gain or loss or 
otherwise take any income or deduction into account by 
reason of the transfer of a proportionate amount of the 
assets of the transferor's Fund to the transferee's Fund (or 
by reason of the transfer of the transferor's Fund to the 
transferee). For purposes of the regulations under section 
468A, this transfer (or the transfer of the transferor's 
Fund) will not constitute a payment or a contribution of 
assets by the transferee to its Fund. 
(3) 

Basis. 

Transfers of assets of a Fund to which this 
section applies do not affect basis. Thus, the transferee's 
Fund will have a basis in the assets received from the 
transferor's Fund that is the same as the basis of those 
assets in the transferor's Fund immediately before the 
disposition. 
(d) 

Determination of proportionate amount. 

For purposes 
of this section, a transferor of a qualifying interest in a 
nuclear power plant is considered to transfer a 
proportionate amount of the assets of its Fund to a Fund of 
a transferee of the interest if, on the date of the transfer 
of the interest, the percentage of the fair market value of 
the Fund's assets that are transferred equals the percentage 
of the transferor's qualifying interest that is transferred. 
(e) 

Calculation of schedule of ruling amounts for 
dispositions described in this section

_(1) 

Transferor. 

If 
a transferor disposes of all or a portion of its qualifying 
interest in a nuclear power plant in accordance with this 
section, the transferor's schedule of ruling amounts with 
respect to the interests disposed of and retained (if any) 
will be determined in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1) (i) 
and (ii) of this section. 
(i) 

Taxable year of disposition. 

If a transferor does 
not file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts 
on or before the deemed payment deadline for the taxable 
year of the transferor in which the disposition of its 
interest in the nuclear power plant occurs (that is, the 
date that is two and one-half months after the close of that 
year), the transferor's ruling amount with respect to that 
plant for that year will equal the sum of_ 
(A) The ruling amount contained in the transferor's 
current schedule of ruling amounts with respect to that 
plant for that taxable year multiplied by the portion of the 
qualifying interest that is retained (if any); and 
(B) The ruling amount contained in the transferor's 
current schedule of ruling amounts with respect to that 
plant for that taxable year multiplied by the product of_ 
(

1

) The portion of the transferor's qualifying interest 
that is disposed of; and 
(

2

) A fraction, the numerator of which is the number of 
days in that taxable year that precede the date of 
disposition, and the denominator of which is the number of 
days in that taxable year. 
(ii) 

Taxable years after the year of disposition. 

A 
transferor that retains a qualifying interest in a nuclear 
power plant must file a request for a revised schedule of 
ruling amounts with respect to that interest on or before 
the deemed payment deadline for the first taxable year of 
the transferor beginning after the disposition. See 
 1.468A-3(i)(1)(ii)(B). If the transferor does not timely 
file such a request, the transferor's ruling amount 
with respect to that interest for the affected year or years 
will be zero, unless the Internal Revenue Service waives the 
application of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) upon a showing of 
good cause for the delay.

(2) 

Transferee. 

If a transferee acquires all or a 
portion of a transferor's qualifying interest in a nuclear 
power plant under this section, the transferee's schedule of 
ruling amounts with respect to the interest acquired will be 
determined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section. 
(i) 

Taxable year of disposition. 

If a transferee does 
not file a request for a schedule of ruling amounts on or 
before the deemed payment deadline for the taxable year of 
the transferee in which the disposition occurs (that is, the 
date that is two and one-half months after the close of that 
year), the transferee's ruling amount with respect to the 
interest acquired in the nuclear power plant for that year 
is the amount described in the following sentence. This 
amount is the amount contained in the transferor's current 
schedule of ruling amounts for that plant for the taxable 
year of the transferor in which the disposition occurred, 
multiplied by the product of_ 
(A) The portion of the transferor's qualifying interest 
that is transferred; and 
(B) A fraction, the numerator of which is the number of 
days in the taxable year of the transferor including and 
following the date of disposition, and the denominator of 
which is the number of days in that taxable year. 
(ii) 

Taxable years after the year of disposition. 

A 
transferee of a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant 
must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts 
with respect to that interest on or before the deemed 
payment deadline for the first taxable year of the 
transferee beginning after the disposition. See 
 1.468A-3(i)(1)(ii)(B). If the transferee does not timely 
file such a request, the transferee's ruling amount with 
respect to that interest for the affected year or years will 
be zero, unless the Internal Revenue Service waives the 
application of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) upon a showing of 
good cause for the delay. 
(3) 

Example. 

The following example illustrates the 
provisions of this paragraph (e). 






Example. 

(i) 

X

 Corporation is a calendar year taxpayer 
engaged in the sale of electric energy generated by a 
nuclear power plant. The plant is owned entirely by 

X

. On 
May 27, 1995, 

X

 transfers a 60 percent qualifying interest 
in the plant to 

Y

 Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer. 
Before the transfer, 

X

 had received a schedule of ruling 
amounts containing an annual ruling amount of $10 million 
for the taxable years 1993 through 2013. For 1995, neither 


X

 nor 

Y

 files a request for a revised schedule of ruling 
amounts. 

(ii) Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, 

X

's 
ruling amount for 1995 is calculated as follows: 
($10,000,000 x 40%) + ($10,000,000 x 60% x 146/365)=$6,400,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)
of this section, Y's 
ruling amount for 1995 is calculated as follows: 
$10,000,000 x 60% x 219/365=$3,600,000. Under 
paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section, 

X

 and 


Y

 must file requests for revised schedules of ruling amounts 
by March 15, 1997.

(f) 

Calculation of the qualifying percentage after 
dispositions described in this section_

(1) 

In general. 

If 
a transferee acquires an interest in a nuclear power plant 
in a transaction that satisfies the requirements of this 
section, the transferee's qualifying percentage (within the 
meaning of  1.468A-3(d)(4)) for the interest acquired is the 
transferor's qualifying percentage for that interest 
immediately before the disposition. If the Internal Revenue 
Service has not approved a qualifying percentage for the 
transferor with respect to the interest transferred, the 
qualifying percentage for that interest is determined under 
 1.468A-3(d)(4). 
(2) 

Special rule. 

The Internal Revenue Service may, in 
its discretion, determine a qualifying percentage for an 
interest in a nuclear power plant acquired by a transferee 
on a basis other than the rule set forth in paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section if_ 
(i) In connection with its first request for a schedule 
of ruling amounts after the disposition, the transferee 
requests special treatment, explains the need for such 
treatment, and sets forth an alternative basis for 
determining the qualifying percentage; and 
(ii) The Internal Revenue Service determines that the 
special treatment is consistent with the purposes of section 
468A. 
(g) 

Other

_(1) 

Anti-abuse provision. 

The Internal 
Revenue Service may treat a disposition occurring on or 
after December 27, 1994 as satisfying the requirements of this 
section if the Internal Revenue Service determines that this 
treatment is necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
purposes of section 468A and the regulations thereunder. 
(2) 

Relief provision. 

Upon request of the electing 
taxpayer, the Internal Revenue Service may treat a 
disposition occurring after July 17, 1984, and before 
December 27, 1994 as satisfying the requirements of this section if 
the Internal Revenue Service determines that this treatment 
is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of 
section 468A and the regulations thereunder. 
(h) 

Effective date. 

Section 1.468A-6 is effective for a 
disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant on or 
after December 27, 1994.

Haitian Transactions Regulations; Termination of Sanctions


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; amendments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to Executive Order 12932 of October 14, 1994 (59 FR 52403), the Treasury Department has terminated, effective
October 16, 1994, all sanctions with respect to Haiti imposed during the period of the national emergency declared
on October 4, 1991 in Executive Order 12775. This termination does not affect compliance and enforcement actions
involving prior transactions or violations of the sanctions.

The Federal Bulletin Board

 the day of publication in the

Background


The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 580
(the ``HTR''), to add 500.524, implementing Executive Order 12932, which authorizes all transactions on or after
October 16, 1994, involving property in which Haiti or its nationals have an interest, and all other transactions
previously prohibited by the HTR. The effect of this amendment is to authorize all transactions previously prohibited
by subpart B of the HTR or by Executive Order 12775, 12779, 12853, 12872, 12914, 12917, 12920 or 12922, effective October
16, 1994. On October 14, 1994, the President signed Executive Order 12932, terminating the national emergency declared
with respect the 

de facto

 regime in Haiti and revoking all Executive orders promulgated with respect to that emergency, effective October
16, 1994. Newly authorized transactions include, but are not limited to, new investment, otherwise lawful importations
from and exportations to Haiti, and brokering transactions. Reports due under general or specific license must still
be filed covering activities up until the effective date of this rule. Enforcement actions with respect to past violations
of the sanctions are not affected by this rule.
Because the HTR involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, does not apply.



List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 580


Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Banking and finance, Blocking of assets, Exports,
Foods, Haiti, Imports, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Shipping, Specially designated
nationals, Transfer of assets, Vessels.
For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 31 CFR part 580 is amended as follows:

occurring after 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, October 16, 1994.
(b) Nothing in this section affects any action taken or proceeding pending and not finally concluded or determined
on, or any action or proceeding based on any act committed prior to, or any rights or duties that matured or penalties
that were incurred prior to 12:01 a.m. EDT, October 16, 1994.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard is adopting as final, with minor revisions, an interim rule allowing for greater delegation by the
District Commander and for a simplified alternative procedure for resolving civil penalty cases. This procedure
streamlines the process for resolution of certain uncontested oil discharge and pollution prevention civil penalty
cases by allowing a Coast Guard official to present a notice of violation (NOV) and proposed penalty to a party in the
field.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Drafting Information 


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Jonathan C. Burton, Project Manager, Marine
Environmental Protection Division, and C.G. Green, Project Counsel, Office of the Chief Counsel. 


Regulatory History 




On April 7, 1994, the Coast Guard published an interim final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16558) establishing an optional alternative civil penalty procedure and announced a six-month pilot implementation
program to test the new procedure. The Coast Guard received 5 letters during the comment period and 4 after the comment
period was closed. All comments were considered before drafting this final rule. No public hearing was requested,
and none was held. 


Background and Purpose 




The procedures for assessing civil penalties by the Coast Guard are contained in 33 CFR 1.07. The civil penalty process
begins when an alleged violation is detected by, or reported to, a Coast Guard official. The alleged violation is investigated
and, if it appears that the elements for a violation case exist, civil enforcement action is normally initiated by
preparing a case report with a recommended penalty and forwarding it to the appropriate Coast Guard District office
for review. Since the establishment of the Notice of Violation (NOV) option, some cases are now eligible for issuance
of a NOV and parties are afforded the option of either paying the proposed penalty and closing the case, or having the
violation processed through normal procedures. 


If the case is not eligible for NOV issuance or if the party declines the NOV, the District staff reviews the case report
to verify that there was evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case and that the recommended penalty is appropriate.
The case file is then transmitted, with a recommended action, to the Hearing Officer. Based on the case file, the Hearing
Officer independently determines whether prima facie evidence of a violation exists and, if so, sends a Letter of
Notification to the alleged violator. This letter specifies, among other matters, the alleged violation(s) and
a penalty amount deemed appropriate based on the information provided to the Hearing Officer. 
A party can pay the penalty amount specified by the Hearing Officer, request an in-person hearing, or provide written
evidence or arguments in lieu of a hearing. If the party pays the penalty, the case is closed and no further action is
required. If the party chooses either of the latter two options, the Hearing Officer either conducts an in-person
hearing or reviews the submitted written evidence and arguments. The Hearing Officer then issues a written decision
assessing a penalty or dismissing the case. The Hearing Officer's decision can be administratively appealed to the
Commandant of the Coast Guard.

The Notice of Violation option was developed to address the Coast Guard's concern that the civil penalty assessment
process was too lengthy when applied to small (under 100 gallons) oil discharges and minor pollution prevention regulation
violations. The lengthy process time meant that a party frequently would have additional violations before being
notified by a Hearing Officer of the initiation of action for the first violation. 


The NOV option provides for early notification of alleged violators and offers early resolution of uncontested small
oil spill and pollution prevention violations. Early resolution of these minor violations saves time and reduces
costs of internal reviews, improves deterrence, and facilitates corrective action by providing a party with earlier
notice of violations. 


The interim rule amended 33 CFR 1.07 to add the optional alternative procedure and the Coast Guard conducted a pilot
program for six months in the Captain of the Port zones of Charleston, SC; Galveston, TX; and Los Angeles, CA. The result
of the pilot program was favorable. During the pilot program 197 NOVs were issued for oil spills and 21 NOVs were issued
for pollution prevention violations with a total penalty value of $96,400. As of October 13, 1994, 160 NOVs had been
paid totaling $57,275 in penalties. 


The optional procedure allows early settlement of cases in which a Coast Guard issuing officer issues a NOV. A Coast
Guard issuing officer is a commissioned, warrant or petty officer with specific training and authority to issue a
violation notice. 


A party has the option of paying the penalty proposed on the NOV, declining the NOV, or taking no action on the NOV. If
a party pays the proposed penalty indicated on a NOV, the case is closed without further processing by a District Program
Manager or Hearing Officer. If a party declines the NOV or takes no action, the case is processed as if an NOV had never
been issued. A complete case file, report and recommended penalty amount is sent to the District Commander for review
prior to being forwarded to the Hearing Officer for processing as any other civil penalty case. The Hearing Officer's
Letter of Notification would specify a penalty deemed appropriate based on the case file. The proposed penalty is
not limited to the amount proposed in the field on the NOV. 


The NOV option will be implemented by Coast Guard Captains of the Port as soon as sufficient numbers of personnel have
been trained in the issuance of NOVs. Representatives from each district, marine safety office, and detachment are
being sent to a ``train the trainer'' course on the NOV option at the Coast Guard Reserve Training Center in Yorktown,
VA. After the initial Yorktown training, each unit will be able to properly train additional personnel. Each district
will publicize the dates when its units will start to use the NOV option. 


Use of the NOV option is initially being limited, by Commandant Directive, to violations of specified regulations
and statutory requirements subject to Class I Administrative Civil Penalties under the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act (FWPCA), as amended. A NOV can be issued for two types of violations: (1) oil discharges in violation of
the FWPCA, if they are 100 gallons or less, and (2) violations of pollution prevention regulations (33 CFR Parts 154,
155, 156) for which the current penalty guidelines list a penalty not greater than $2500. 


Coast Guard issuing officers can issue a NOV only in cases that meet specific written guidance. Penalty amounts are
taken from a penalty schedule and may not be increased or decreased by the issuing officer. Any case in which aggravating
or extenuating circumstances are involved, or in which the violations do not meet the specific written guidance,
is not eligible for NOV issuance and will be processed for referral to the Hearing Officer in accordance with normal
procedures.

Delegation by the District Commander 33 CFR 1.07-10(b) 



The District Commander now has more flexibility to delegate authority for review of alleged violations to any member
under the District Commander's command. For example, the District Commander may now delegate case review authority
to the Captain of the Port for certain pollution prevention violations, thus eliminating the need for review by the
District Commander's staff prior to forwarding the case to a Hearing Officer. The expanded delegation authority
allows District Commanders greater flexibility in allocating their personnel resources to process violation cases.




Discussion of Comments and Changes 



I. General Comments 



The Interim rule language of  1.07-11 and the NOV form used for the pilot program left the impression that
a party could request a hearing on the proposed penalty offered by the NOV. In fact, if a party does not wish to accept
the NOV, a full case is forwarded to the Hearing Officer who then makes an independent determination and issues a preliminary
assessment letter to which the party can respond. To clarify this procedure  1.07-11 now specifies that
the NOV include a statement that the party may decline the NOV and, if the NOV is declined, the party has the right to a
hearing prior to a final assessment of a penalty by a Hearing Officer. The NOV also states that taking no action on the
NOV has the same result as declining the NOV but the processing time may increase. Furthermore, the NOV form makes it
clear that the Hearing Officer is in no way bound by any assessment proposed by the NOV. To facilitate understanding
of these rights the NOV form is reproduced in Figure 1.

Two comments received during the pilot program were in favor of the regulations and suggested that the NOV option be
broadened to include other Coast Guard programs. 

The NOV option can be used by other Coast Guard programs that use the civil penalty process. Any program that implements
use of the NOV option will do so by internal policy with prior notification to the public in the 

Federal Register

. 

Three comments were in favor of the alternative process but suggested different penalty amounts for small oil spills
and pollution prevention regulation violations. 

The penalty amounts specified for small oil spills and pollution prevention regulation violations used during the
pilot program were based on current Commandant's policy guidelines for assessing Coast Guard civil penalties. These
penalty amounts are reviewed regularly to ensure that they reflect a fair and equitable enforcement policy. 

The pilot program results indicated that the current small oil spill penalties were appropriate. However, the Coast
Guard has revised some penalties for pollution prevention violations. Results of the pilot program indicated that
using the same penalty amounts for pollution prevention violations as those specified in the current Commandant's
policy guidelines for assessing Coast Guard civil penalties provided no incentive to accept an NOV. To encourage
acceptance of the NOV, pollution prevention violations that have a recommended penalty of $2,500 or less under the
Commandant's civil penalty guidelines will be proposed on an NOV at 75% of the amount listed for the specific offense.
Pollution prevention violations that have a recommended penalty of $2,500 or more under the Commandant's civil penalty
guidelines are no longer eligible for issuance of an NOV and will be sent to the Hearing Officer for a determination.
The NOV option will be closely monitored to determine if additional spill categories or different penalties are needed
in the future. 

Two comments asked that the determination of first offense be based on the record of each platform or vessel, not the
company as a whole. 

The Coast Guard agrees that for purposes of NOV issuance each platform, vessel, or unit should be treated separately
when determining whether or not it is a first offense for the purpose of assessing penalties. This is reflected in the
NOV implementation guidance. 

One comment indicated that Coast Guard petty officers do not have the experience to make a judgment as to when to issue
a NOV and that any assessment should only be made after review by a higher ranking authority. 

The Coast Guard disagrees. Coast Guard Petty Officers selected as issuing officers are trained professionals who
have demonstrated knowledge and ability in their field. Before any Petty Officer investigates a violation and issues
a NOV, he or she is first given proper instruction and is determined to be qualified by his or her command. Issuing officers,
however, have no discretion in assessing penalty amounts. If an NOV is issued, the penalty amount is taken directly
from the implementing guidance. If the offense does not meet specific criteria in the guidance, an NOV cannot be issued.


One comment stated that a party should be given the right to be heard prior to the issuance of a NOV. 

The Coast Guard disagrees. A party is not entitled to a hearing prior to initiation of civil penalty action. Under Coast
Guard procedures, the ``initiation of civil penalty action'' occurs with the Letter of Notification from a Hearing
Officer, or in some cases with the NOV. The NOV does not take away any rights a party has to a hearing. The NOV procedure
is voluntary, and the recipient of an NOV may opt to have the case processed under ordinary procedures which include
the right to a hearing before disposition on the case. 

Three comments expressed general confusion over how the NOV option will work and concern about the protection of rights
for a party issued an NOV. 

The NOV is an opportunity to use an optional procedure for processing civil penalty cases. It may be declined by a party.
The NOV form states that a party may decline the NOV, which will immediately result in a violation case being forwarded
through the appropriate district to a Hearing Officer for determination. The form also states that taking no action
on the NOV has the same result as declining the NOV. A ``no action'' response will, however, delay the referral of the
case to the District for review because the 45-day from issuance period must elapse before the Coast Guard begins processing
the case under normal procedures. A change has been made to  1.07-11(b)(6) to reflect this procedure.

Three comments expressed concern that the implementing guidance was not provided to the public during the pilot program.


A number of individuals requested, and were provided, the Coast Guard's NOV guidance during the pilot program. A copy
of current implementing guidance is available by writing to: 

Marine Environmental Protection Division (G-MEP), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW.,
room 3406, Washington, DC 20593-0001. 

Three comments felt that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) should have been published instead of an interim final
rule (IFR). 

The changes to 33 CFR 1.07 are procedural and provide a benefit to the public. Thus, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3) a NPRM was
not necessary. An IFR was published to provide a regulatory basis to conduct the pilot program. Comments were encouraged
and a six month comment period was established. All comments were considered in implementing this final rule. The
NOV procedure is optional and use of the procedure provides a benefit to the public. The IFR, however, requested comments
both on the procedure and on its implementation. Those comments were considered before issuing this Final Rule, however
no comments resulted in substantial change to the IFR. 

One comment expressed concern that Coast Guard personnel would be over-zealous in their prosecution of civil penalty
cases against small business. 

The NOV option has safeguards built in to protect from such an occurrence. The criteria for using an NOV is based on the
size of a spill and the violation history of the party to whom it may be issued. Issuing officers may not deviate from
this criteria. 

One comment encouraged the Coast Guard to proceed with a final rule but make sure that all rights of a party are preserved
and that ``no response'' should not be interpreted as acceptance of a penalty. 

As previously discussed, ``no response'' will result in processing of a violation through ordinary procedures as
if a NOV had never been issued. 

One comment asked that the NOV be provided to an officer of the company that is being cited rather than an employee who
may not pass it to the appropriate official. The comment also suggested that 60 days is a more reasonable time to respond.


Since the purpose of the NOV option is to provide immediate notification of a settlement offer, it is impractical to
always deliver the NOV to a company officer. Further, the NOV may be against an individual, not a company. Every effort
is made to ensure that the correct responsible party is identified. 

As to the length of time to pay an NOV, the Coast Guard agrees that 30 days was too short a period. As a result of the pilot
program the Coast Guard had already decided to lengthen the time a party has to respond to an NOV. During the pilot program
the number of NOVs paid within 30 days was approximately 65%, while payment before 45 days exceeded 85%. Therefore,
the deadline for payment of a penalty in a NOV in order to avoid submission of the case to the Hearing Officer established
in  1.07-11(b)(4) has been changed from 30 to 45 days. 



Regulatory Evaluation 



No comments were received on the draft regulatory evaluation. This rule is not a significant regulatory action under
section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section
6(a)(3) of that order. It is not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures''
(44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects there to be minimal economic impact from this procedural
rule and a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The total annual cost to the public from civil penalties is not
increased by this rule. Both the public and the government should realize savings from the reduction in administrative
processing costs through eliminating the need for review by the District Commander and action by the Hearing Officer
in those cases in which the penalty specified in a NOV is paid within the allowed time by the party.

Small Entities 



Only one comment was received on the impact of the interim rule on small entities. That comment concerned potential
over-zealous enforcement and is discussed in the comment section of this preamble. Under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Coast Guard considered whether this rulemaking would have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This rule is administrative in nature, making final an alternate method of processing
violation cases. The total number of civil penalties levied against the public does not substantially change as the
result of this regulation. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Collection of Information 



This rulemaking contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U. S. C.
3501 

et seq

.). 



Federalism 



No comments were received on the federalism implications of the interim rule. The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule
under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have
sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



Environment 



No comments were received on the environmental impact of the interim rule. The Coast Guard considered the environmental
impact of this rulemaking and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.lB, this rule
is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Procedural rules do not require environmental
impact studies. 



List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 1

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard is redesignating and revising certain regulations relating to delegation of authority. The changes
incorporate amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) made by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA
90); provisions added to the United States Code by OPA 90; and certain provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (SARA). These statutes relate to discharges and releases of oil, hazardous substances, pollutants, and
contaminants. The changes reflect, in large part, additional responsibilities assigned to Coast Guard On-Scene
Coordinators to direct responses to spills of oil and hazardous substances.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information 



The principal person involved in drafting this document is Ms. Jacqueline Sullivan, Project Manager, OPA 90 Staff.




Background and Purpose 



The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) [Pub. L. 101-380] amended several provisions of section 311 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) [33 U.S.C. 1321] relating to the prevention of and response to discharges of oil
and hazardous substances. Several new functions under both OPA 90 and the amended section 311 of the FWPCA were vested
in the President. Others were vested in the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Executive
Order 12777 [3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 351, 56 FR 54757, October 22, 1991] assigned many new functions and reassigned many
preexisting functions to the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary reassigned many new and preexisting
functions to the Commandant of the Coast Guard [49 CFR 1.46 (l), (m), and (ll)]. 

The Commandant, by internal directive dated March 19, 1992, redelegated most of the functions under OPA 90 and section
311 of the FWPCA. Copies of the Commandant's redelegation memorandum are available by calling G-MEP at the telephone
number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 

The amendments to 33 CFR subpart 1.01 in this rulemaking reflect much of that redelegation. 

These rules also delegate authority to Coast Guard officials to carry out certain functions under CERCLA, as amended
by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) [42 U.S.C. 9601, 

et seq

., Pub. L. 96-510, 94 Stat. 2767, as amended by Pub. L. 99-499, 100 Stat. 1613] relating to the release of
hazardous substances. Executive Order 12580 delegated the President's functions under CERCLA, as amended, to the
heads of various Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the Secretary of Transportation [3 CFR, 1987
Comp., p. 193, 52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987]. The Secretary of Transportation has redelegated certain functions to
the Commandant of the Coast Guard [49 CFR 1.46 (ff) and (gg)]. This rule further delegates authority to designated
Coast Guard officials under CERCLA relating to the enforcement of financial- responsibility requirements, including
the assessment of civil penalties. 



Discussion of Rules 



The revisions, removals, and additions to the regulations in 33 CFR parts 1 and 153 are organized in the following manner:

<TEXT>
 

Section 1.01-30 is revised to delete reference to the authority of command, warrant, and petty officers of the
Coast Guard to assist in discharging the duties of the Captain of the Port. This authority is now contained in a new  1.01-90
which reflects that the authority exists to carry out the functions of District and Area Commanders, and Officers
in Charge, Marine Inspection in addition to Captains of the Ports. 


Section 1.01-70 is revised to reflect delegations of authority under CERCLA to each District Commander to enforce
requirements for financial responsibility of vessels and the assessment of civil penalties. 


Section 1.01-80 is added to reflect delegations to Area and District Commanders that are currently located
in  153.105(a); delegations of authority to the Coast Guard's Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security, and
Environmental Protection, that are currently located in  153.105(b); and delegations to On-Scene Coordinators
that are currently located in  153.105(c). The text of  1.01-80 also includes delegations of functions
under provisions of OPA 90, such as new authority for assessment of civil penalties provided in section 4303 of OPA
90 [33 U.S.C. 2716a], and amendments to section 311 of the FWPCA regarding additional authority for inspection and
entry provided in section 4305 of OPA 90 [33 U.S.C. 1321(m)]. 


Section 1.01-85 is added by redesignating the delegations of authority currently found in 153.107 and revising
them with respect to officers under the staff and command of individuals delegated authority in  1.01-80.



Section 1.01-90 is added to allow authorization of any commissioned, warrant, or petty officer of the U.S. Coast
Guard to carry out functions delegated to superior officials under   1.01-1, 1.01-20, 1.01-30,
1.01-70, and 1.01-80, or redelegated under  1.01-85, within the jurisdiction of the cognizant
official. 


The authority cite for subpart 1.07 has been revised to restore an inadvertent deletion during a prior rulemaking.



Section 153.105 is revised to reflect the administrative move of FWPCA delegations of authority to the new  1.01-80.



Section 153.107 is removed; and the text, revised to cite  1.01-80 authorities, is included in new  1.01-85.





Regulatory Evaluation 




This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) [44 FR 11304 (February 26, 1979)]. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary. This rulemaking expedites the Coast Guard's ability to respond to discharges of oil and hazardous
substances and thereby limits the potential effect of those discharges. 


Because the changes to its regulations relate to agency management and organization, the Coast Guard finds that under
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) [5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)] notice and the opportunity for public comment are unnecessary.
Further, since the regulations are being revised to accurately reflect statutory changes, the Coast Guard finds
good cause under the APA [5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)] for the final rule to be effective on the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

. 




Small Entities 




Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed
rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000. This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore,
is exempt from the requirements of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential
impact on small entities.

<PARENT> FR941227-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


This rule will have no adverse impacts, economic or other. It improves the Coast Guard's ability to respond to discharges
of oil and hazardous substances. Therefore, the Coast Guard's position is that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 




Collection of Information 





This rule contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act [44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

]. 




Federalism 





The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. 




Environment 





The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
This rule will only affect internal agency procedure. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in
the docket for inspection or copying at the Office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G-LRA,
3406) 
[CGD 91-225], U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001 between
8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267-1477.

List of Communities Eligible for the Sale of Flood Insurance 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule identifies communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These communities
have applied to the program and have agreed to enact certain floodplain management measures. The communities' participation
in the program authorizes the sale of flood insurance to owners of property located in the communities listed. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management measures aimed at protecting lives and new
construction from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized
flood insurance is now available for property in the community. 



In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas
in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The
date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed
where a flood map has been published, Section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance
for acquisition or construction of buildings in the special flood hazard areas shown on the map. 

The Director finds that the delayed effective dates would be contrary to the public interest. The Director also finds
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Associate Director certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

., because the rule creates no additional burden, but lists those communities eligible for the sale of flood insurance.




Regulatory Classification 



This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq

. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, October
26, 1987, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 252. 



Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform 



This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, October 25, 1991, 56 FR 55195,
3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 309.

Authority To Issue Subpoenas




<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission adopted this rule which will delegate to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, or her/his designee, the
authority to issue subpoenas to persons or entities not subject to the Commission's administrative jurisdiction
in the investigation of matters involving allegations of unlawful activity by common carriers under Title II of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's order in FCC 94-319, adopted December 13, 1994, and released December 21,
1994. The full text of the rule is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference
Center, Room 239, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20554. The full text of this rule may also be purchased from
the Commission's duplicating contractor, International Transcription Services, 2100 M Street, N.W., Suite 140,
Washington, D.C. 20037, (202) 857-3800.



Summary of Order



1. Section 409(e) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act), 47 U.S.C.  409(e), grants the Commission
express authority to require by subpoena information relating to any matter under investigation. This authority
may be delegated in accordance with Section 5(c)(1) of the Act. 47 U.S.C.  155(c)(1). The agency's power of subpoena
is not confined to those over whom it exercises regulatory jurisdiction, but extends to private individuals and entities
over whom it does not.

2. We find that the delegation of authority to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to issue administrative subpoenas
in the investigation of matters involving any alleged violation or violations of Title II of the Act will facilitate
investigations of unlawful activity by common carriers and is, therefore, in the public interest.



Ordering Clauses



3. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, that, pursuant to Section 5(c)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47
U.S.C.  155(c)(1), authority is delegated to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to require by administrative
subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda,
schedules of charges, contracts, agreements, and any other records deemed relevant to the investigation of common
carriers for any alleged violation or violations of Title II of the Act.

4. It is further ordered that  0.291 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 0.291, be amended to add a paragraph (j)
to reflect this delegation of authority. This amendment of the Commission's rules is contained below. The requirement
of notice and comment rule making contained in 5 U.S.C.  553(b) and the effective date provisions of 5 U.S.C.
 553(d) do not apply since this amendment concerns matters of agency organization, procedure, or practice.


See

 5 U.S.C.   553(b)(A), 553(d).

5. It is further ordered that this amendment of Section 0.291, as set forth below, is effective upon publication in

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notification of suspension of surf clam minimum size limit.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS informs the public that the minimum size limit of 4.75 inches (12.065 cm) for Atlantic surf clams is suspended
for the 1995 fishing year. The intended effect is to reduce a regulatory burden while safeguarding the resource. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


A final rule implementing Amendment 8 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog Fishery
(FMP) was published on June 14, 1990 (55 FR 24184). Section 652.22(a)(1) allows the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS,
(Regional Director) to suspend annually, by publication of a document in the 

Federal Register

, the minimum size limit for Atlantic surf clams. This action may be taken unless discard, catch, and survey data indicate
that 30 percent of the Atlantic surf clam resource is smaller than 4.75 inches (12.065 cm), and the overall reduced
size is not attributable to beds where growth of the individual clams has been reduced because of density-dependent
factors.
At its September meeting, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) accepted the recommendations
of its Statistical and Scientific Committee and Surf Clam/Ocean Quahog Committee and voted to recommend that the
Regional Director suspend the minimum size limit. NMFS port agents conducted a random sample of landed surf clams
in 1994. Results indicate that only 27.33 percent of the sample was composed of clams that were less than 4.75 inches
(12.065 cm). Based on the sampling results, the Regional Director adopts the Council's recommendation and publishes
this notice to suspend the minimum size limit for Atlantic surf clams for the period January 1, 1995, through December
31, 1995.


Classification


This action is authorized by 50 CFR part 652 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866.

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises the HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 570, subpart F, which govern the administration of the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) Small Cities Program. The purpose of subpart F is to set forth the procedures by which
CDBG funds are provided to non-entitled units of general local government in those States which have 

not

 elected to assume administration of the CDBG formula allocations for use in non-entitled units of general local government
within such States. The rule amends subpart F to incorporate the statutory changes made to the Small Cities Program
since the subpart F regulations were issued in 1982, and streamlines the operation and administration of the program.
In addition, the rule makes additional changes to subpart F, and various changes to subparts I and M which are necessary
to permit use of the section 108 loan guarantee authority by non-entitled units of general local government in States
which have not elected to assume administration of the CDBG formula allocations for nonentitlement areas of such
States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background_September 15, 1994 Proposed Rule 



On September 15, 1994 (59 FR 47500), HUD published a proposed rule that would amend HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part
570, subpart F, which govern the administration of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Small Cities Program.
The proposed rule provided for a 30-day public comment period. By the end of the comment period on October 17, 1994,
21 comments had been received. The 21 commenters consisted of 11 units of general local government (7 New York, 3 Hawaii,
1 Arizona), 5 consultants, and 5 public and private non-profits. These commenters made approximately 75 different
comments about the September 15, 1994 proposed rule; many of these comments were made by more than one commenter. Section
II of this preamble describes the changes made to the proposed rule at the final rule stage, and Section III of the preamble
sets forth the issues and questions raised by the public commenters, and HUD's responses to these issues and questions.




II. Principal Differences Between Proposed Rule and Final Rule



This final rule is substantially the same as the September 15, 1994 proposed rule. The principal differences are as
follows: 



1. Multiyear Plans 



The final rule provides that HUD may issue notices of funding availability that provide for a competition for applications
that have multiyear plans (see  570.421(a)(2)).

<PARENT> FR941227-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Economic Development Grants



The final rule also provides that HUD intends to use the section 108 loan guarantee program to the maximum extent feasible
to fund economic development projects in the nonentitlement areas of New York State (see  570.421(a)(5)).




3. Counties Applying on Behalf of Units of General Local Government 



The final rule provides criteria under which counties may apply on behalf of units of general local government located
within their jurisdiction when the unit of general local government has authorized the county to apply. 




4. Pre-Agreement Costs 



The final rule provides that HUD authorizes a unit of general local government to incur costs during the same or the
prior Federal Fiscal Year for preparation of a CDBG grant application, planning costs eligible under  570.205,
environmental assessments, and project engineering and design costs for eligible activities under  570.201-204
before the establishment of a formal grant relationship between the applicant and HUD. Such costs for the funded activities
may be charged to the grant should it be funded, provided that the activities are undertaken in accordance with the
requirements of subpart F (see  570.425(a)(3)). This includes compliance with selection of contractors under
24 CFR 85.36 if, for example, a contractor prepares the application or plans and specifications. 




5. HUD Action on Final Application 



The final rule adds two new paragraphs to  570.425(b). Paragraph (b)(3) provides that HUD will not make a Small
Cities grant when it is determined that the grant will only have a minimal or insignificant impact on the grantee. Paragraph
(b)(4) provides that in determining appropriate grant amounts to be awarded, HUD may take into account the size of
the applicant, the level of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity,
among others. (See  570.425(b) (3) and (4).) 



6. Streamlined Application Requirements for Previous Applicants 



The final rule adds a new paragraph (c) to  570.425 to provide for streamlined application requirements for
previous applicants. (See  570.425(c).) 



7. Clarification of ``Publication of Proposed Application'' 



The final rule adds a new paragraph to  570.431(c) to explain what is meant by publication of the proposed application.
(See  570.431(c)(4).) 



8. Hawaii Grantee Amendments 



The final rule clarifies the procedures that Hawaii grantees must follow in making amendments to final applications.
(See  570.431(f).) 


9. Report Submission Date.




The final rule extends the deadline for New York Grantees to submit their performance and evaluation report on the
small cities grant to October 31 (see  570.507(a)(2)(ii)(A)) and sets forth the date Hawaii grantees must submit
their performance and evaluation report (see  570.507(a)(2)(ii)(B).) 



III. Comments on the Proposed Rule and HUD's Responses



This section sets forth the issues and comments made by the public commenters on the September 15, 1994 proposed rule,
and HUD's responses to these issues and questions.

There were several comments that the application time period to respond to the Small Cities NOFA should be more than
60 days. The final rule will not establish the application time period for the Small Cities NOFA. The request for a longer
application time period was taken into consideration in development of the Federal Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 NOFA. 

Ten commenters commented on the number of funding competitions that should be held for the Small Cities Program during
each fiscal year. Since the optimum number of competitive rounds will vary according to circumstances, the Small
Cities NOFA will state the number of competitions that will be held in the time period that is covered by the NOFA. 

Four commenters stated that the issue date for the NOFA and the due date of competitive applications should be established
by regulation. To retain maximum flexibility to address changing conditions, the Department has decided that these
dates should not be established by regulation. 

Five commenters submitted comments on the maximum grant limits. In order to retain flexibility due to changing conditions
such as inflation, the Small Cities NOFA, rather than the rule, will address the issue of grant limits. 

One commenter requested that the Department establish a set amount of funding for each funding round. Although the
Department agrees with this comment, the NOFA rather than the rule is a better vehicle to address this issue. 

One commenter said that if it was necessary to expand the competition beyond housing, public facilities, and economic
development, the final rule should so state this. Since it is impossible to foresee the types of competition that might
benefit small jurisdictions in the State of New York in the future, the rule provides in  570.421(a)(1) that
there will be competitive applications. 

Three commenters commented on the application page limits. Again, this is an issue that will be addressed in the NOFA
to retain flexibility to adjust page limit requirements. The Department acknowledges that reducing the size of grant
applications will reduce paperwork which is a goal shared by the majority of participants at the meetings held in the
State of New York to discuss the proposed regulation. 

A few commenters requested that the Small Cities NOFA remain as constant as possible from year to year. The Department
intends to do this to the extent possible. 

One commenter asked that the Department provide technical assistance after the issuance of the NOFA. Although this
matter is not one that should be addressed in the final rule, the Department intends to provide the maximum amount of
technical assistance that is permitted under section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act.

Another commenter requested that the Department provide an even playing field for small communities. In the history
of the program, small communities have been successful in obtaining grants, and the Department sees no need to change
the final rule in this regard. 



Involvement in the Rulemaking Process



Another commenter requested that people with rural backgrounds be involved in the rulemaking process. This was accomplished
by two highly publicized meetings with that were held in Auburn and Goshen, New York as well as having the Assistant
Secretary for Community Planning and Development write to each eligible unit of general local government individually,
asking for their comments in helping to shape the final rule and NOFA. 



Administration of Small Cities Program by the State of New York



Two commenters stated that the Small Cities Program should not be given to New York State to administer. Section 106
(d)(2) of Title I, gives States the right to elect to administer the State CDBG Program. The Department cannot administratively
amend this provision. 



Single Audit and Davis-Bacon Requirements



Commenters asked that the Single Audit and Davis-Bacon Acts be made inapplicable to the Small Cities Program. To adopt
this comment would require a statutory change. 



Rehabilitation



Three commenters asked that the non-targeted rehabilitation program be continued. Although this issue is too specific
to be addressed by the regulations, there is nothing in the Small Cities regulations that would preclude a grantee
from initiating a non-targeted rehabilitation program. A request was made by one commenter to fund more HUD staff
travel. Although the Department is sensitive to the need of HUD Field staff to travel to small cities in New York, the
travel budget is determined by annual appropriations and is not an appropriate issue to be addressed by the final regulation.


One commenter stated that funds should be allowed to be used to rehabilitate pre-1976 mobile homes. While the Department
is unclear as to the commenters' reference to pre-1976 mobile homes, manufactured housing can be rehabilitated in
accordance with  570.202(a)(4), since the State of New York recognizes manufactured housing as real property.


One commenter stated that senior citizens on fixed income should be able to get rehabilitation grants. The major purpose
of the CDBG program is to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Senior citizens who are of low- and moderate-income
are eligible to receive housing rehabilitation grants. Senior citizens who have higher incomes cannot receive grants
unless the activity is to aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight. Title I does not give higher income
senior citizens preference over low- and moderate-income non senior citizens. 



Household Incomes



One commenter asked that households with incomes between 80-100 percent of median be eligible to receive rehabilitation
assistance in non-targeted areas. The Department notes that this can be done under  570.208(b)(2) as long as
the rehabilitation is limited to the extent necessary to eliminate specific conditions detrimental to public health
and safety. 



Multiyear Plans



One commenter said that community facilities should not be funded on a multiyear basis, but should be funded through
a large grant of up to $900,000. The Department decided not to restrict community facilities from being part of multiyear
plan projects. However, to the extent a project consisting, for example, of one large building cannot logically be
subdivided into segments that are viable as separate grants, the project would have to be funded from a single year's
grant funds under  570.421(a)(1). Larger public facilities projects, however, can now be funded with Section
108 loan guarantee assistance under  570.703(l). 

One commenter said that the first year of the multiyear plan should be fifteen months, and another commenter indicated
that there should be a site visit 9-10 months into the multiyear plan. These comments are operational in nature
and not appropriate to be addressed by the final rule. 



Priority for EZs/ECs



One commenter stated that Empowerment Zones (EZ) and Enterprise Communities (EC) should not receive a priority in
the final regulation. The Department agrees that the final regulation is an inappropriate place to show support for
the EZ/EC program and can more appropriately lend its support in the NOFA. 



Public Hearings



A commenter stated that public hearings should be able to be combined with hearings for other purposes. The Department
agrees, and notes that this is the Department's policy, and therefore, need not be stated specifically in the final
rule. 



Abbreviated Consolidated Plan



Several commenters requested that the abbreviated Consolidated Plan requirements be made as simple as possible.
It is the Department's intention to do this, but the NOFA is a more appropriate vehicle for doing this since the abbreviated
Consolidated Plan may need to be changed based on ongoing experience in program administration. At this time the abbreviated
Consolidated Plan is not yet required. (The FY 1995 NOFA requires an abbreviated CHAS if the application contains
housing activities.) After the Consolidated Plan final rule is published, succeeding NOFAs will explain the requirements.
The final rule for the Consolidated Plan will make conforming changes to this regulation. The final rule will not apply
to applications under the FY 1995 NOFA for the State of New York.

B. Specific Comments on Rule Sections



Section 570.420 General



Five commenters call for the abbreviated CHAS requirement to be eliminated. Section 570.420(d) requires that there
be a certification in the Small Cities application that housing activities proposed to be funded by the Small Cities
Program must be consistent with the applicant's abbreviated CHAS. This is required by 24 CFR part 91 and Section 105(b)
of the National Affordable Housing Act. 

One commenter wanted to lower the requirement that 70 percent of the grant funds must be used to benefit low-and moderate-income
persons to 51 percent. The Department believes that the commenter misunderstands the requirement. Under  570.208(a)(1),
if at least 51 percent of the residents of an area are low- and moderate-income persons, an activity that benefits that
area is considered to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Section 570.200(a)(3)(v) provides that area benefit
activities are to count as benefitting low- and moderate-income persons 100 percent. Accordingly, if a water project
is funded for $300,000, which benefits an area that is 57 percent low-and moderate-income, the entire $300,000 is
considered to be benefitting low- and moderate-income persons. 

Three commenters said that the regulations should clearly state that  570.200(a)(3)(iii) applies, and that
grantees should not include Section 108 loan repayments in the calculations for meeting the objective that not less
than 70 percent of the total of grant funds from each grant and Section 108 loan guarantee funds received under 24 CFR
part 570, subpart M, within a fiscal year, must be expended for activities that benefit low-and moderate-income persons.
The Department agrees and paragraph (e)(2) was revised to incorporate this change. 

Eight commenters protested the elimination of the rating and ranking scoring factors from the regulations. As a result
of these comments,  570.421(a) has been added to the final rule to describe the selection system. 

There were multiple comments recommending that the Department establish an Economic Development set-aside with
an open window, so that economic development applications could be submitted at any time during the year. Commenters
also suggested that Section 108 loan guarantees be used to fund economic development projects to the greatest extent
possible. These comments are addressed in  570.421(a)(5), which provides that the Department will use the
Section 108 loan guarantee program to the greatest extent possible to fund Economic Development projects, and that
the Department will fund Economic Development applications as they are determined to be fundable in a specific amount
by HUD. All Economic Development projects that are funded with Small Cities funds must have a substantial impact on
the needs identified by the applicants. 

One commenter stated that only housing and public facilities applications should be funded during the competitive
funding cycles. Under the new  570.421(a) (``Selection system''), both competitive applications and the
first year of multiyear plans will be funded on a competitive basis with the NOFA indicating how that competition will
be held. Since ``Economic Development'' and ``Imminent Threat'' projects funded on a non-competitive basis, the
competition will essentially include housing, public facilities, and comprehensive applications. 

One commenter suggested that the division between comprehensive projects and single purpose projects be retained
with an eye towards evening the chances of obtaining funding from both types of projects. Another commenter requested
that funding be continued for comprehensive grants. The nomenclature of single purpose and comprehensive projects
has been removed from the final rule, but the Department may elect to retain and define such categories in a NOFA. Under
the final rule, there will be competitions for competitive applications and multiyear plans with the funding divided
between the categories fine-tuned by a NOFA that will be issued each year. The former single purpose projects will
be eligible for funding as competitive applications. The former comprehensive projects may be funded as either competitive
applications or as multiyear grants. 

One commenter requested that the Department allow counties to apply on behalf of municipalities. This suggestion
was incorporated into the final rule at 24 CFR 570.421(c)(3). Another commenter suggested that the Department encourage
county-wide applications. County-wide applications are eligible for funding and will receive the same consideration
as all other applications for Small Cities funding. 

Six commenters requested that the Department allow multiyear funding for comprehensive grants. This comment was
adopted in  570.421(a)(2) of the final rule, which will allow the Department to fund multiyear plans. After
the first year of a multiyear plan is funded, the Department may fund future years on a non-competitive basis subject
to acceptable performance, submission of an acceptable application and certifications, and the provision of adequate
appropriations. 

One commenter stated that multiyear grantees should not receive other grants during the time period that the multiyear
grant was ongoing. The Department decided that this issue is more appropriately addressed in the NOFA rather than
the rule. 

Another commenter suggested that consideration be given to female and disabled heads of household in giving fair
housing points and contracts given to female-owned businesses should be taken into account in reporting minority
business enterprise achievements. In order to retain flexibility to address changing priorities, the Department
decided that the makeup of the fair housing and equal opportunity points will be disseminated in the NOFA rather than
the regulations. 



Section 570.424 Grants for Imminent Threats to Public Health and Safety



Three commenters wanted the imminent threat set-aside retained in the final rule, and one commenter wanted it deleted.
The Department decided to retain the imminent threat set-aside to give the Department the flexibility to respond
immediately to threats to health and safety such as flood damage from hurricanes. 



Section 570.425
HUD Review and Actions on Applications for New York State Applicants



One commenter said that if there was more than one funding round in a fiscal year, an unsuccessful application should
be able to be resubmitted in the next round. The Department agrees and paragraph (c) was added to  570.425 which
authorizes HUD to provide in a NOFA that unsuccessful applications will be automatically held over for the succeeding
rounds of competition if the applicant so requests in writing. The applicant will have the option of amending or withdrawing
its application. For FY 1995, applications not funded in FY 1994 will automatically be reconsidered under the FY 1995
NOFA unless the applicant notifies HUD otherwise. 

Another commenter indicated that HUD should ensure that applications are funded for the least amount of funds necessary
to implement the proposed activities. As a result of this comment, paragraph (b)(4) was added to  570.425 of
the final rule. This paragraph gives the Department the right to take into account the size of the applicant, the level
of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons to be
served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives and the administrative capacity of the applicant
to complete the activities in a timely manner in determining the appropriate grant amount to award. 

To respond to a commenter's request to even the playing field for smaller communities, the Department has revised
 570.425(a)(3) in the final rule to allow units of general local government to incur costs for certain CDBG grant
activities before the establishment of a formal grant relationship and charge the pre-agreement costs to the grant,
should it be funded. This includes the cost of application preparation, but does not create an obligation on part of
the Department to fund the application.

Section 570.426 Program Income


One commenter wrote favorably of  570.426(c) which provides that if a unit of general local government has no
open CDBG grant at the time of closeout, program income of less than $25,000 per year after closeout will not be considered
program income, and will not be subject to the requirements of this part. This provision has been retained in the final
regulation. 



Section 570.429 Hawaii General and Grant Requirements


Three counties in the State of Hawaii commented that they did not want the method of distribution of Hawaii Small Cities
funds to be changed by the issuance of a NOFA because that would impinge upon the ability of the Hawaii grantees to plan
for future use of Small Cities funds. The Department agrees with this comment, and all references to a NOFA for the Hawaii
Small Cities program were removed from  570.429. 
Two commenters from the State of Hawaii thought that paragraph (d)(1) of  570.429 should be revised to better
define ``capacity to utilize the grant amount effectively and efficiently''. This term was used in the previous regulation
at  570.435(c)(1)(ii)(A), and does not need to be redefined. 
Two commenters from the State of Hawaii requested that Hawaii grantees follow the application submission requirements
in 24 CFR part 570, subpart D. Another commenter said that applications should be accepted and not approved. Section
570.429 has been revised to treat the Hawaii grantees as much like entitlement grantees as possible. Since the program
is still discretionary under section 106(d) of Title I, the Department decided that applications should be required
to be submitted and approved. Paragraph (g) of  570.429 indicates that the Department will approve the application
unless it is shown that ``one or more of the following requirements (relating to completeness, timeliness, certifications,
and compliance with this part) have not been met''. This provision gives assurance to Hawaii grantees that applications
that are complete, timely, contain the proper certifications, and which are otherwise in compliance with this part
will be approved. 

Another commenter from the State of Hawaii asked that paragraph (d)(2) of  570.429 regarding timely expenditures
only consider grants from FY 1995 onward. Since it is the policy of the Department to encourage timely expenditures,
the Department decided that all outstanding grants should be used in calculating timely expenditures under  570.902(a).
The Department notes that Kauai's disaster grant will not be considered in the calculations.
 
The final rule on the Consolidated Plan, which will be published shortly, will change the application, citizen participation,
approval and reporting requirements for the Hawaii grantees. These changes will be incorporated into subpart F at
the time the final consolidated plan regulation is promulgated. In view of the probable timing of submission of applications
by Hawaii grantees, it is anticipated that these rule changes will apply to FY 1995 applications by Hawaii grantees.




Section 570.430 Hawaii Program Operation Requirements


One commenter stated that paragraph (a) of  570.430 should be clarified to indicate that grants received in
FY 1995 and thereafter are grants made from FY 1995 allocations and thereafter, and that grants made prior to FY 1995
are grants from allocations prior to FY 1995. This revision has been made in the final rule. 



Section 570.431 Citizen Participation



Four comments from the State of Hawaii concerned citizen participation requirements. One commenter requested that
paragraph (e) of  570.431 be revised to indicate that the citizen participation requirements apply to the State
of Hawaii, and two commenters requested that the entitlement citizen participation process be followed, and one
commenter requested that the entitlement amendment process be followed by Hawaii grantees. The Department has decided
to add a new paragraph (f) to  570.431 to clarify the requirements that Hawaii Small Cities grantees must follow.
The citizen participation requirements are being included in the Small Cities final rule for clarity. It is noted
that the citizen participation requirements for Hawaii grantees will be revised shortly, when the final rule on consolidated
planning requirements is published. 



Section 570.432 Repayment of Section 108 Loans



Six commenters stated that Section 108 funds should not be used for the New York Small Cities Program because repayment
will come from the total allocation of discretionary Small Cities funding for the State of New York. One commenter
said that Section 108 funds must be backed by the community's own resources. In making non-entitled units of general
local government in the State of New York eligible for the Section 108 program, the Department intends to provide small
communities with the opportunity to fund large economic development projects_projects that they would not ordinarily
be able to fund. Since it is envisioned that a significant portion of economic development funding will come from the
Section 108 loan guarantee fund rather than the HUD-administered Small Cities Program, there will be more Small Cities
funds available to fund non-economic development projects, even if a small portion of funds are used under  570.432
to repay amounts due on Section 108 loan obligations. All Section 108 loan obligations will be underwritten to ensure
that only high quality projects are funded. In addition, the Department is considering instituting loan insurance
pools to further ensure that the cost to the Small Cities Program will be minimized. 



Section 570.507 Reports



The Department agrees with the three commenters that indicated fifteen working days is insufficient time for New
York grantees to submit a performance assessment report and has extended the period to 31 calendar days in the final
rule. (See  570.507(a)(2)(ii)(A).) 
Three commenters from the State of Hawaii requested that HUD consider a uniform period of activity for their Small
Cities performance and evaluation report. The Department agrees and  570.507(a)(2)(ii)(B) provides for
this.

Subpart M_Section 570.702 Eligible Applicants 


Two commenters requested that the Department make available the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program to non-entitled
units of local governments in the HUD-administered Small Cities Program. The Department agrees that the non-entitled
communities in the States of New York and Hawaii should have available the use of Section 108 and  570.702(c)
provides for this. 



III. Other Matters 



Environmental Impact


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24
CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, at the time of the
development of the proposed rule. Because no substantial programmatic changes have been made, that finding remains
applicable to this final rule. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during regular
business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. 



Impact on Small Entities



The Secretary, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), has reviewed this final rule
before publication, and by approving it certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The rule proposes to modify, simplify and update the administration and
procedural requirements of the CDBG Small Cities Program to conform with legislation applicable to this program.
Accordingly, the final rule is anticipated to have some beneficial impact on small entities. However, the number
of small entities that may be affected by this rule will not be substantial and the economic impact will not be significant.




Federalism Impact


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism, 

has determined that this final rule does not have Federalism implications and therefore is not subject to review under
the Order. No programmatic or policy changes will result from this rule's promulgation which will have a substantial
direct effect on the States, or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibility among the various levels of government. 



Family Impact


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family, 

has determined that this final rule does not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance
and general well-being, and thus is not subject to review under the Order. No significant changes in existing HUD policies
or programs will result from promulgation of this rule. 



Regulatory Agenda


This final rule was listed as sequence number 1834 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published
on November 14, 1994 (59 FR 57632, 57662) pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Subpart F_Small Cities Program 


 570.420 

General. 



(a) 

HUD administration of nonentitlement CDBG funds. 

Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 permits each State to elect to administer all aspects of
the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program annual fund allocation for the nonentitlement areas within
its jurisdiction. This subpart sets forth policies and procedures applicable to grants for nonentitlement areas
in States that have not elected to administer the CDBG Program. States that elected to administer the program after
the close of fiscal year 1984 cannot return administration of the program to HUD. A decision by a State to discontinue
administration of the program would result in the loss of CDBG funds for nonentitled areas in that State and the reallocation
of those funds to all States in the succeeding fiscal year. 

(b) 

Scope and applicability. 

(1) This subpart describes the policies and procedures of the Small Cities Program which apply to nonentitlement
areas in States where HUD administers the CDBG Program. HUD currently administers the Small Cities Program in only
two States_New York and Hawaii. This subpart principally addresses the requirements for New York, and  570.429-30
identifies special procedures applicable to Hawaii. 

(2) The allocation of formula CDBG funds for use in nonentitled areas of Hawaii and New York is as provided in subpart
A of this part. The policies and procedures set forth in the following identified subparts of this part 570 apply to
the HUD-administered Small Cities Program, except as modified or limited under the provisions thereof or this subpart:


(i) Subpart A_General Provisions; 
(ii) Subpart C_Eligible Activities; 
(iii) Subpart J_Grant Administration; 
(iv) Subpart K_Other Program Requirements; and 
(v) Subpart O_Performance Reviews. 
(c) 

Public notification requirements. 

(1) Section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) contains a number
of provisions that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types
of assistance administered by HUD. All competitive grants in the HUD-administered Small Cities Program in New York
are affected by this legislation, and the requirements identified at 24 CFR part 12 apply to them. Imminent threat
grants under  570.424 and section 108 repayment grants under  570.432 are not affected by section 102
as they are not competitive grants. 

(2) The Hawaii HUD-administered Small Cities Program is not subject to section 102, since the funds are not distributed
in a competitive manner. 

(d) 

Abbreviated CHAS. 

Applications for the HUD-administered Small Cities Program which contain housing activities must include a certification
that the proposed housing activities are consistent with the applicant's Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy as described at 24 CFR part 91. 

(e) 

National and primary objectives. 

(1) Each activity funded through the Small Cities Program must meet one of the following national objectives as defined
under the criteria in  570.208. Each activity must:

(i) Benefit low- and moderate-income families; 
(ii) Aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight; or 
(iii) Be an activity which the grantee certifies is designed to meet other community development needs having a particular
urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community
where other financial resources are not available to meet such needs. 
(2) In addition to the objectives described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, with respect to grants made through
the Small Cities Program, not less than 70 percent of the total of grant funds from each grant and Section 108 loan guarantee
funds received under subpart M of this part within a fiscal year must be expended for activities which benefit low-
and moderate-income persons under the criteria of  570.208(a). In the case of multiyear plans, in New York State,
not less than 70 percent of the total funding for grants approved pursuant to a multiyear plan for a time period of up
to 3 years must be expended for activities which benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Thus, 70 percent of the
grant for year 1 of a multiyear plan must meet the 70 percent requirement, 70 percent of the combined grants from years
1 and 2 must meet the requirement, and 70 percent of the combined grants from years 1, 2 and 3 must meet the requirement.
In determining the percentage of funds expended for such activity, the provisions of  570.200(a)(3)(i), (iii),
(iv) and (v) shall apply.

(a) 

Selection system. 

(1) 

Competitive applications. 

Each competitive application will be rated and scored against the following factors: 
(i) Need-absolute number of persons in poverty as further explained in the NOFA; 
(ii) Need-percent of persons in poverty as further explained in the NOFA; 
(iii) Program Impact, and 
(iv) Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity which may include assessment of the applicant's Section 3 plan and implementation
efforts. The NOFA described in paragraph (b) of this section will contain a more detailed description of these factors,
and the relative weight that each factor will be given. 
(2) In addition HUD reserves the right to establish minimal thresholds for selection factors and otherwise select
grants in accordance with  570.425 and the applicable NOFA. 
(3) 

Multiyear Plans. 

The notice of funding availability may provide for a competition for applications that have multiyear plans. The
plans will be rated and scored against factors in paragraph (a)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section. The action plan
for each year of the multiyear plan must be a viable project on its own. If the multiyear plan is selected on a competitive
basis, the first year will be funded and HUD may fund future years on a non-competitive basis subject to acceptable
performance, submission of an acceptable application and certifications, and the provision of adequate appropriations
for the HUD-administered Small Cities Program. 

(4) 

Imminent threats to public health and safety. 

The criteria for these grants are described in  570.424. 

(5) 

Repayment of section 108 loans. 

The criteria for these grants are described in  570.432. 

(6) 

Economic development grants. 

HUD intends to use the Section 108 loan guarantee program to the maximum extent feasible to fund economic development
projects in the nonentitlement areas of New York. In the event that there are not enough Section 108 loan guarantee
funds available to fund viable economic development projects, or if a project needs a grant in addition to a loan guarantee
to make it viable, or if the project does not meet the requirements of the Section 108 program but is eligible for a grant
under this subpart, HUD will fund Economic Development applications as they are determined to be fundable in a specific
amount by HUD up to the sum set aside for economic development projects in the notice of funding availability. HUD also
has the option in a NOFA of funding economic development activities on a competitive basis, as a competitive application
as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In order for an applicant to receive Small Cities grant funds, the
field office must determine that the economic development project will have a substantial impact on the needs identified
by the applicant. 

(b) 

Notice of funding availability. 

HUD will issue one or more Notice(s) of Funding Availability (NOFA) each fiscal year which will indicate the amount
of funds available, the annual grant limits per grantee, type of grants available, the application requirements,
and the rating factors that will be used for those grants which are competitive. A NOFA may set forth, subject to the
requirements of this subpart, additional selection criteria for all grants. 

(c) 

Eligible applicants. 

(1) Eligible applicants in New York are units of general local government, excluding: Metropolitan cities, urban
counties, units of general local government which are participating in urban counties or metropolitan cities, even
if only part of the participating unit of government is located in the urban county or metropolitan city. Indian tribes
are also ineligible for assistance under this subpart. An application may be submitted individually or jointly by
eligible applicants. 

 (2) Counties, cities, towns, and villages may apply and receive funding for separate projects to be done in the same
jurisdiction. Only one grant will be made under each funding round for the same type of project to be located within
the jurisdiction of a unit of general local government (e.g. both the county and village cannot receive funding for
a sewer system to be located in the same village, but the county can receive funding for a sewer system that is located
in the same village as a rehabilitation project for which the village receives funding). The NOFA will contain additional
information on applicant eligibility.

<TEXT>
 

(3) Counties may apply on behalf of units of general local government located within their jurisdiction when the unit
of general local government has authorized the county to apply. At the time that the county submits its application
for funding, it must submit a resolution by the governing body of the unit of local government that authorizes the county
to submit an application on behalf of the unit of general local government. The county will be considered the grantee
and will be responsible for executing all grant documents. The county is responsible for ensuring compliance with
all laws, regulations, and Executive Orders applicable to the CDBG Program. HUD will deal exclusively with the county
with respect to issues of program administration and performance, including remedial actions. The unit of general
local government will be considered the grantee for the purpose of determining grant limits. The unit of general local
government's statistics will be used for purposes of the selection factors referred to in  570.421(a). 

(d) 

Public service activities cap. 

Public service activities may be funded up to a maximum of fifteen (15) percent of a State's nonentitlement allocation
for any fiscal year. HUD may award a grant to a unit of general local government for public service activities with up
to 100 percent of the funds intended for public service activities. HUD will apply the 15 percent statewide cap to public
service activities by funding public service activities in the highest rated applications in each NOFA until the
cap is reached. 

(e) 

Activities outside an applicant's boundaries. 

An applicant may conduct eligible CDBG activities outside its boundaries. These activities must be demonstrated
to be appropriate to meeting the applicant's needs and objectives, and must be consistent with State and local law.
This provision includes using funds provided under this subpart in a metropolitan city or an urban county. 



 570.422 

Applications from joint applicants. 



Units of general local government may submit a joint application which addresses common problems faced by the jurisdictions,
to the extent permitted by the NOFA. A joint application must be pursuant to a written cooperation agreement submitted
with the application. The cooperation agreement must authorize one of the participating units of government to act
as the lead applicant which will submit the application to HUD, and must delineate the responsibilities of each participating
unit of government with respect to the Small Cities Program. The lead applicant is responsible for executing the application,
certifications, and grant agreement, and ensuring compliance with all laws, regulations, and Executive Orders
applicable to the CDBG Program. HUD will deal exclusively with the lead applicant with respect to issues of program
administration and performance, including remedial actions. In the event of poor performance, HUD reserves the
right to deny and/or restrict future funding to all units of general local government which are parties to the cooperation
agreement. 



 570.423 

Application for the HUD-administered New York Small Cities Grants. 



(a) 

Proposed application. 

The applicant shall prepare and publish a proposed application, and comply with citizen participation requirements
as described in  570.431. 

(b) 

Final application. 

The applicant shall submit to HUD a final application containing its community development objectives and activities.
This final application shall be submitted, in a form prescribed by HUD, to the appropriate HUD Office. 

(c) 

Certifications. 

(1) Certifications shall be submitted in a form prescribed by HUD. If the application contains any housing activities,
the applicant shall certify that the proposed housing activities are consistent with its Abbreviated Comprehensive
Housing Affordability Strategy as described at 24 CFR part 91.

(2) In the absence of evidence (which may, but need not, be derived from performance reviews or other sources) which
tends to challenge in a substantial manner the certifications made by the applicant, the certifications will be accepted
by HUD. However, if HUD does have available such evidence, HUD may require the submission of additional information
or assurances before determining whether an applicant's certifications are satisfactory. 

(d) 

Thresholds. 

The HUD Office may use any information available to it to make the threshold judgments required by the applicable NOFA,
including information related to the applicant's performance with respect to any previous assistance under this
subpart. The annual performance and evaluation report required under  570.507(a) is the primary source of
this information. The HUD Office may request additional information in cases where it is essential to make the required
performance judgments.

 570.424 

Grants for imminent threats to public health and safety. 



(a) 

Criteria. 

The following criteria apply for an imminent threat to public health or safety: 

(1) The Director of Community Planning and Development of the HUD office may, at any time, invite an application for
funds available under this subpart in response to a request for assistance to alleviate an imminent threat to public
health or safety that requires immediate resolution. HUD shall verify the urgency and the immediacy of the threat
with an appropriate authority other than the applicant prior to acceptance of the application, and the Director of
Community Planning and Development of the HUD Office shall review the claim to determine if, in fact, an imminent threat
to public health or safety does exist. For example, an applicant with documented cases of disease resulting from a
contaminated drinking water supply has an imminent threat to public health, while an applicant ordered to improve
the quality of its drinking water supply over the next two years does not have an imminent threat within the definition
of paragraph (a) of this section. These funds are to be used to deal with those threats which represent a unique and unusual
circumstance, not for the type of threat that occurs with frequency in a number of communities within the State of New
York. 

(2) The applicant does not have sufficient local resources, and other Federal or State resources are unavailable
to alleviate the imminent threat. 

(3) All imminent threat projects must meet the requirement of  570.420(e). 

(b) 

HUD action. 

(1) Fifteen percent of the funds allocated to New York State in the Small Cities Program may be reserved to alleviate
imminent threats to the public health or safety unless a lesser amount is specified in a NOFA. Applications shall be
submitted in accordance with  570.423. 

(2) Applications which meet the requirements of this section may be approved by the Director of Community Planning
and Development of the HUD Office without competition. 

(3) The only funds reserved for imminent threats to the public health or safety are those specified by this section
as modified by the NOFA. After the funds have been depleted, HUD shall not consider further requests for grants relating
to imminent threats during that fiscal year. 

(c) 

Letter to proceed. 

Notwithstanding  570.425(a)(3), after a determination has been made that an imminent threat exists, HUD may
issue the applicant a letter to proceed to incur costs to alleviate the imminent threat. Reimbursement of such costs
is dependent upon HUD approval of the final application. 

(d) 

Environmental review. 

Pursuant to 24 CFR 58.34(a)(8), grants for imminent threat to public health or safety are excluded from some or all
of the environmental review requirements of 24 CFR part 58, to the extent provided therein. 



 570.425 

HUD review and actions on applications for New York State applicants. 



(a) 

Final application submission. 

(1) 

Submission deadline. 

HUD will establish a time period during which final applications must be submitted to the appropriate office. The
dates for this period will be published in a notice in the 

Federal Register

. 

(2) 

Incomplete applications. 

Applications must contain the information required by HUD. Information relative to the application will not be accepted
or considered if received after the submission deadline, unless the information is specifically requested in writing
by HUD. 

(3) 

Pre-agreement costs. 

HUD authorizes a unit of general local government to incur costs during a Federal fiscal year in which a grant is made
or the prior fiscal year for preparation of a CDBG grant application, planning costs eligible under  570.205,
environmental assessments, and project engineering and design costs for eligible activities under  570.201
through 570.204 before the establishment of a formal grant relationship between the applicant and HUD. Costs of such
activities for the funded application may be charged to the grant should it be funded, provided that the activities
are undertaken in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, and 24 CFR part 58. It is understood that the incurring
of costs described in this paragraph creates no obligation on HUD to approve the application. 

(b) 

HUD action on final application. 

(1) 

Review and notification.

 Following the review of the applications, HUD will promptly notify each applicant of the action taken with regard
to its application. Documentation which supports HUD's decisions on applications will be available to the public.


(2) 

Conditional approval. 

HUD may make a conditional approval, in which case the grant will be approved but the obligation and utilization of
funds will be restricted. The reasons for the conditional approval and the actions necessary to remove the condition
will be specified. Failure to satisfy the condition may result in a termination of the grant.

<PARENT> FR941227-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) HUD will not make a Small Cities grant when it is determined that the grant will only have a minimal or insignificant
impact on the grantee.

(4) 

Individual grant amounts.

 In determining appropriate grant amounts to be awarded, HUD may take into account the size of the applicant, the level
of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons to be
served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives and the administrative capacity of the applicant
to complete the activities in a timely manner.

(c) 

Streamlined application requirement for previous applicants.

 HUD may provide pursuant to a NOFA that if an applicant notifies HUD in writing within the application period specified
in a NOFA that it wishes to be so considered, HUD will consider unfunded applications from the prior round or competition
that meet the threshold requirements of the NOFA. For FY 1995 only, unfunded applications from the FY 1994 competition
will be automatically reactivated for consideration unless the applicant notifies the Department in writing by
the date specified in the FY 1995 NOFA that it does not wish to have the FY 1994 application considered in the FY 1995 competition.
The applicant will have the option of withdrawing its application, or amending or supplementing the application
for succeeding rounds of competition. If there is no significant change in the application involving new activities
or alteration of proposed activities that will significantly change the scope, location or objectives of the proposed
activities or beneficiaries, there will be no further citizen participation requirement to keep the application
active for succeeding rounds of competition.



 570.426

 Program income.



(a) The provisions of  570.504(b) apply to all program income generated by a specific grant and received prior
to grant closeout.

(b) If the unit of general local government has another ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, the program income
will be considered to be program income of the ongoing grant. The grantee can choose which grant to credit the program
income to if it has multiple open CDBG grants.

(c) If the unit of general local government has no open ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, program income of
the unit of general local government or its subrecipients which amounts to less than $25,000 per year will not be considered
to be program income. When more than $25,000 of program income is generated from one or more closed out grants in a year
after closeout, the entire amount of the program income is subject to the requirements of this part. This will be a subject
of the closeout agreement described in  570.509(c).



 570.427

 Program amendments.



(a) 

HUD approval of certain program amendments.

 Grantees shall request prior HUD approval for all program amendments involving new activities or alteration of existing
activities that will significantly change the scope, location, or objectives of the approved activities or beneficiaries.
Approval is subject to the following:

(1) Programs or projects that include new or significantly altered activities are rated in accordance with the criteria
for selection applicable at the time the original preapplication or application (whichever is applicable) was rated.
The rating of the program or projects proposed which include the new or altered activities proposed by the amendment
must be equal to or greater than the lowest rating received by a funded project or program during that cycle of ratings.

(2) Consideration shall be given to whether any new activity proposed can be completed promptly.

(3) If the grant was received on a non-competitive basis, the proposed amended project must be able to be completed
promptly, and must meet all of the threshold requirements that were required for the original project. If the proposal
is to amend the project to a type of project that was rated competitively in the Fiscal Year that the non-competitive
project was funded, the new or altered activities proposed by the amendment must receive a rating equal to or greater
than the lowest rating received by a funded project or program during that cycle of ratings.

(b) 

Documentation of program amendments.

 Any program amendments that do not require HUD approval must be fully documented in the grantee's records.

(c) 

Citizen participation requirements.

 Whenever an amendment requires HUD approval, the requirements for citizen participation in  570.431 must
be met.



 570.428

 Reallocated funds.



(a) 

General.

 This section governs reallocated funds originally allocated for use under 24 CFR part 570, subpart F (Small Cities
Program).

(b) 

Assignment of funds to be reallocated.

 Reallocated funds may be:

(1) Used at any time necessary for a section 108 repayment grant under  570.432;

(2) Added to the next Small Cities Program competition;

(3) Used to fund any application not selected for funding in the most recent Small Cities competition, because of a
procedural error made by HUD; or

(4) Used to fund the most highly ranked unfunded application or applications from the most recent Small Cities Program
competition.

(c) 

Timing.

 Funds which become available shall be used as soon as practicable.



 570.429

 Hawaii general and grant requirements.



(a) 

General.

 This section shall apply to the HUD-administered Small Cities Program in the State of Hawaii.

(b) 

Scope and applicability.

 Except as otherwise provided in this section, the policies and procedures outlined in subparts A, C, J, K, O of this
part, and in   570.420 and 570.430 through 570.432, shall apply to the HUD-administered Small Cities
Program in the State of Hawaii.

(c) 

Grant amounts.

 (1) For each eligible unit of general local government, a formula grant amount will be determined which bears the same
ratio to the total amount available for the nonentitlement area of the State as the weighted average of the ratios between:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-0-00106 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) The population of that eligible unit of general local government and the population of all eligible units of general
local government in the nonentitlement areas of the State;

(ii) The extent of poverty in that eligible unit of general local government and the extent of poverty in all the eligible
units of general local government in the nonentitled areas of the State; and

(iii) The extent of housing overcrowding in that eligible unit of general local government and the extent of housing
overcrowding in all the eligible units of general local government in the nonentitled areas of the State.

(2) In determining the average of the ratios under this paragraph (c), the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall
be counted twice and each of the other ratios shall be counted once. (0.25 + 0.50 + 0.25 = 1.00).

(d) 

Adjustments to grants.

 Grant amounts under this section may be adjusted where an applicant's performance is judged inadequate, considering:

(1) Capacity to utilize the grant amount effectively and efficiently;

(2) Compliance with the requirements of  570.902(a) for timely expenditure of funds beginning with grants
made in FY 1996. In making this calculation, all outstanding grants will be considered. For the FY 1995 grant the requirement
is substantial compliance with the applicant's schedule or schedules submitted in each previously funded application;

(3) Compliance with other program requirements based on monitoring visits and audits.

(e) 

Reallocation.

 (1) Any amounts that become available as a result of adjustments under paragraph (d) of this section, or any reductions
under subpart O of this part, shall be reallocated in the same fiscal year to any remaining eligible applicants on a
pro rata basis.

(2) Any formula grant amounts reserved for an applicant that chooses not to submit an application shall be reallocated
to any remaining eligible applicants on a pro rata basis.

(3) No amounts shall be reallocated under paragraph (e) of this section in any fiscal year to any applicant whose grant
amount was adjusted under paragraph (d) of this section or reduced under subpart O of this part.

(f) 

Applications.

 (1) 

Presubmission.

 The applicant will follow the requirements of  570.301(a) and (c), as well as the requirements of this section.

(2) 

Submission.

 (i) HUD will require all applicants to submit an application for the amount established under paragraphs (c) through
(e) of this section by a date established by HUD, and to follow the requirements of  570.302(a)(1) and (2).

(ii) 

Certifications.

 Certifications shall be submitted in a form prescribed by HUD. If the application contains any housing activities,
the applicant shall certify that the proposed housing activities are consistent with its Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy as described at 24 CFR part 91.

(g) 

Application Approval.

 HUD will approve the application and certifications unless it is determined that one or more of the following requirements
have not been met.

(1) 

Completeness.

 The submission shall include all of the components required in paragraph (f) of this section.

(2) 

Timeliness.

 The submission must be received within the time period established in paragraph (f) of this section.

(3) 

Certifications.

 The certifications made by the grantee will be satisfactory to the Secretary if made in conformance with the requirements
of paragraph (f) of this section, unless the Secretary has determined pursuant to subpart O of this part that the grantee
has not complied with the requirements of this part or has failed to carry out its Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy in a timely manner, or determined that there is evidence, not directly involving the grantee's past performance
under this program, which tends to challenge in a substantial manner the grantee's certification of future performance.
If the Secretary makes any such determination, however, further assurances may be required to be submitted by the
grantee as the Secretary may deem warranted or necessary to find the grantee's certification satisfactory.

(h) 

Grant agreement.

 The grant will be made by means of a grant agreement executed by both HUD and the grantee.

(i) 

Conditional grant.

 The Secretary may make a conditional grant in which case the obligation and use of grant funds for activities may be
restricted. Conditional grants may be made where there is substantial evidence that there has been, or there will
be, a failure to meet the performance requirements or criteria described in subpart O of this part. In such case, the
conditional grant will be made by means of a grant agreement, executed by HUD, which includes the terms of the condition
specifying the reason for the conditional grant, the actions necessary to remove the condition and the deadline for
taking those actions. The grantee shall execute and return such an agreement to HUD within 60 days of the date of its
transmittal. Failure of the grantee to execute and return the grant agreement within 60 days may be deemed by HUD to
constitute rejection of the grant by the grantee and shall be cause for HUD to determine that the funds provided in the
grant agreement are available for reallocation in accordance with section 106(c) of the Act. Failure to satisfy the
condition may result in a reduction in the grant amount pursuant to  570.911.




(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2506-0060)



 570.430

 Hawaii program operation requirements.



(a) 

Limitation on planning and administrative costs.

 For grants made with allocations prior to FY 1995, no more than 20 percent of the sum of the grant plus program income
received during the grant period shall be expended for planning and program administrative costs. For grants received
from allocations in FY 1995 and thereafter, a grantee will be considered to be in conformance with the requirements
of  570.200(g) if expenditures for planning and administration during the most recently completed program
year do not exceed 20 percent of the sum of the grant made for that program year and the program income received from post
FY 1994 grants during that program year.

(b) 

Performance and evaluation reports.

 Grantees will follow the requirements of  570.507(a) for entitlement grant recipients for all grants received
in FY 1995 and thereafter. Grantees will continue following the requirements of  570.507(a) for HUD-administered
small cities grants for grants received prior to FY 1995 until those grants are closed out.

(c) 

Grant closeouts.

 Grants received prior to FY 1995 shall be closed out in accordance with the procedures in  570.509. Grants received
in FY 1995 and thereafter shall not be closed out individually. A grantee's entire program shall be closed upon program
completion if a grantee ceases its participation in the Small Cities Program.

(d) 

Public Services.

 Starting with the FY 1996 grant, grantees may follow the provisions of  570.201(e)(1) that refer to entitlement
grantees, allowing grantees to use 15 percent of the program income received in the previous program year in addition
to 15 percent of the grant amount for public services.

(e) 

Compliance with the primary objective.

 Starting with the FY 1995 grant, grantees may select a time period of one, two or three program years in which to meet
the requirement that not less than 70 percent of the aggregate of CDBG fund expenditures be for activities benefitting
low- and moderate-income persons. Grants made from allocations prior to FY 1995 will be considered individually
for meeting the primary objective, and expenditures for grants from pre FY 1995 allocations made during and after
FY 1995 will not be considered in determining whether the primary objective has been met for post 1994 allocations.
If the State of Hawaii decides to administer the Community Development Block Grant Program for non-entitled units
of general local government in Hawaii, the State will be bound by the time period for meeting the primary objective
that was chosen by each non-entitled grantee within the State until those time periods have expired.

(f) 

Amendments.

 (1) The grantee shall amend its application whenever it decides not to carry out an activity described in its application,
to carry out an activity not previously described, or to substantially change the purpose, scope, location, or beneficiaries
of an activity. Prior to the submission of its FY 1995 application, each grantee shall develop and make public its criteria
for what constitutes a substantial change for this purpose. 
(2) Prior to amending its application, a grantee shall follow the citizen participation requirements of  570.431
except that HUD is not required to approve the amendment. 


 570.431 

Citizen participation. 


(a) 

General.

 An applicant that is located in a nonentitlement area of a State that has not elected to distribute funds shall comply
with the citizen participation requirements described in this section, including requirements for the preparation
of the proposed application and the final application. The requirements for citizen participation do not restrict
the responsibility or authority of the applicant for the development and execution of its community development
program. 
(b) 

Citizen participation plan.

 The applicant must develop and follow a detailed citizen participation plan and must make the plan public. The plan
must be completed and available before the application for assistance is submitted to HUD, and the applicant must
certify that it is following the plan. The plan must set forth the applicant's policies and procedures for: 
(1) Giving citizens timely notice of local meetings and reasonable and timely access to local meetings, information,
and records relating to the grantee's proposed and actual use of CDBG funds including, but not limited to: 
(i) The amount of CDBG funds expected to be made available for the coming year, including the grant and anticipated
program income; 
(ii) The range of activities that may be undertaken with those funds; 
(iii) The estimated amount of those funds proposed to be used for activities that will benefit low and moderate income
persons; 
(iv) The proposed CDBG activities likely to result in displacement and the applicant's plans, consistent with the
policies developed under  570.606(b), for minimizing displacement of persons as a result of its proposed activities;
and 
(v) The types and levels of assistance the applicant plans to make available (or to require others to make available)
to persons displaced by CDBG-funded activities, even if the applicant expects no displacement to occur; 
(2) Providing technical assistance to groups representative of persons of low and moderate income that request assistance
in developing proposals. The level and type of assistance to be provided is at the discretion of the applicant. The
assistance need not include the provision of funds to the groups; 
(3) Holding a minimum of two public hearings, for the purpose of obtaining citizen's views and formulating or responding
to proposals and questions. Each public hearing must be conducted at a different stage of the CDBG program. Together,
the hearings must address community development and housing needs, development of proposed activities and review
of program performance. There must be reasonable notice of the hearings and the hearings must be held at times and accessible
locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries, with reasonable accommodations including material
in accessible formats for persons with disabilities. The applicant must specify in its plan how it will meet the requirement
for hearings at times and locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries; 
(4) Meeting the needs of non-English speaking residents in the case of public hearings where a significant number
of non-English speaking residents can reasonably be expected to participate; 
(5) Responding to citizen complaints and grievances, including the procedures that citizens must follow when submitting
complaints and grievances. The applicant's policies and procedures must provide for timely written answers to written
complaints and grievances within 15 working days of the receipt of the complaint, where practicable; and 
(6) Encouraging citizen participation, particularly by low- and moderate-income persons who reside in slum or blighted
areas, and in other areas in which CDBG funds are proposed to be used. 
(c) 

Publication of proposed application.

 The applicant shall publish a proposed application consisting of the proposed community development activities
and community development objectives in order to afford affected citizens an opportunity to: 
(1) Examine the application's contents to determine the degree to which they may be affected; 
(2) Submit comments on the proposed application; and 
(3) Submit comments on the performance of the applicant. 
(4) The requirement for publishing may be met by publishing a summary of the proposed application in one or more newspapers
of general circulation, and by making copies of the proposed application available at libraries, government offices,
and public places. The summary must describe the contents and purpose of the proposed application, and must include
a list of the locations where copies of the entire proposed application may be examined. 
(d) 

Preparation of a final application.

 An applicant must prepare a final application. In the preparation of the final application, the applicant shall consider
comments and views received related to the proposed application and may, if appropriate, modify the final application.
The final application shall be made available to the public and shall include the community development objectives
and projected use of funds, and the community development activities. 
(e) 

New York Grantee Amendments.

 To assure citizen participation on program amendments to final applications that require HUD approval under  570.427,
the grantee shall: 
(1) Furnish citizens information concerning the amendment; 
(2) Hold one or more public hearings to obtain the views of citizens on the proposed amendment;

(3) Develop and publish the proposed amendment in such a manner as to afford affected citizens an opportunity to examine
the contents, and to submit comments on the proposed amendment; 
(4) Consider any comments and views expressed by citizens on the proposed amendment and, if the grantee finds it appropriate,
modify the final amendment accordingly; and 
(5) Make the final amendment to the community development program available to the public before its submission to
HUD.

 570.432 

Repayment of section 108 loans. 


Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a unit of general local government in a nonentitlement area
where the State has not elected to administer the CDBG program shall be eligible for Small Cities Grant assistance
hereunder for the sole purpose of paying any amounts due on debt obligations issued by such unit of general local government
(or its designated public agency) and guaranteed by the Secretary pursuant to section 108 of the Act (see subpart M
of this part). The award of grant assistance for such purpose shall be consistent with section 106(d)(3)(B) of the
Act, in such amount, and subject to such conditions as the Secretary may determine. Since guaranteed loan funds (as
defined in  570.701) are required to be used in accordance with national and primary objective requirements,
and other applicable requirements of this part, any grant made to make payments on the debt obligations evidencing
the guaranteed loan shall be presumed to meet such requirements, unless HUD determines that the guaranteed loan funds
were not used in accordance with such requirements. Any such determination by HUD shall not prevent the making of the
grant in the amount of the payment due, but it may be grounds for HUD to take appropriate action under subpart O based
on the original noncompliance. 
3. In 24 CFR part 570, subpart I, a new  570.497 is added to read as follows: 


 570.497 

Condition of State election to administer State CDBG Program. 


Pursuant to section 106(d)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, a State has the right to elect, in such manner and at such time as the
Secretary may prescribe, to administer funds allocated under subpart A of this part for use in nonentitlement areas
of the State. After January 26, 1995, any State which elects to administer the allocation of CDBG funds for use in nonentitlement
areas of the State in any year must, in addition to all other requirements of this subpart, submit a pledge by the State
in accordance with section 108(d)(2) of the Act, and in a form acceptable to HUD, of any future CDBG grants it may receive
under subpart A and this subpart. Such pledge shall be for the purpose of assuring repayment of any debt obligations
(as defined in  570.701), in accordance with their terms, that HUD may have guaranteed in the respective State
on behalf of any nonentitlement public entity (as defined in  570.701) or its designated public agency prior
to the State's election. 
4. In  570.507, paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) is revised to read as follows: 


 570.507 

Reports. 


(a) * * * 
(2) * * * 
(ii) * * * 
(A) The first report on a small cities grant for a New York grantee should be submitted no later than October 31 for all
grants executed prior to April 1 of the same calendar year. The first report should cover the period from the execution
of the grant until September 30. Reports on grants made after March 31 of a calendar year will be due October 31 of the
following calendar year and the reports will cover the period of time from the execution of the grant until September
30 of the calendar year following grant execution. After the initial submission, the performance and evaluation
report will be submitted annually on October 31 until completion of the activities funded under the grant; 
(B) Hawaii grantees will submit their small cities performance and evaluation report for each pre-FY 1995 grant no
later than 90 days after the completion of their most recent program year. After the initial submission, the performance
and evaluation report will be submitted annually until completion of the activities funded under the grant; and 
(C) No later than 90 days after the criteria for grant closeout, as described in  570.509(a), have been met.

Presubmission and citizen participation requirements

. 

(1) Before submission of an application for loan guarantee assistance to HUD, the public entity must: 

(i) Develop a proposed application that includes the following items: 

(A) The community development objectives the public entity proposes to pursue with the guaranteed loan funds. 

(B) The activities the public entity proposes to carry out with the guaranteed loan funds. Each activity must be described
in sufficient detail, including the specific provision of  570.703 under which it is eligible and the national
objective to be met, amount of guaranteed loan funds expected to be used, and location, to allow citizens to determine
the degree to which they will be affected. The proposed application must indicate which activities are expected to
generate program income. The application must also describe where citizens may obtain additional information about
proposed activities. 

(C) A description of the pledge of grants required under  570.705(b)(2). In the case of applications by State-assisted
public entities, the description shall note that pledges of grants will be made by the State and by the public entity.


(ii) Fulfill the applicable requirements in its citizen participation plan developed in accordance with  570.704(a)(2).


(iii) Publish community-wide its proposed application so as to afford affected citizens an opportunity to examine
the application's contents and to provide comments on the proposed application. 

(iv) Prepare its final application. Once the public entity has held the public hearing and published the proposed
application as required by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, respectively, the public entity must
consider any such comments and views received and, if the public entity deems appropriate, modify the proposed application.
Upon completion, the public entity must make the final application available to the public. The final application
must describe each activity in sufficient detail to permit a clear understanding of the nature of each activity, as
well as identify the specific provision of  570.703 under which it is eligible, the national objective to be
met, and the amount of guaranteed loan funds to be used. The final application must also indicate which activities
are expected to generate program income. 

(v) If an application for loan guarantee assistance is to be submitted by an entitlement public entity simultaneously
with the public entity's submission for its entitlement grant, the public entity shall include and identify in its
proposed and final statements of community development objectives and projected use of funds prepared for its annual
grant pursuant to  570.301 the activities to be undertaken with the guaranteed loan funds, the national objective
to be met by each of these activities, the amount of any program income expected to be received during the program year,
and the amount of guaranteed loan funds to be used; the public entity shall also include in these statements a description
of the pledge of grants required under  570.705(b)(2). In such cases the proposed and final application requirements
of paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (iii), and (iv) of this section will be deemed to have been met. 

(2) 

Citizen participation plan

. The public entity must develop and follow a detailed citizen participation plan and make the plan public. The plan
must be completed and available before the application is submitted to HUD. The plan may be the plan required for the
CDBG program, modified to include guaranteed loan funds. The public entity is not required to hold a separate public
hearing for its CDBG program and for the guaranteed loan funds to obtain citizens' views on community development
and housing needs. The plan must set forth the public entity's policies and procedures for: 

(i) Giving citizens timely notice of local meetings and reasonable and timely access to local meetings, information,
and records relating to the public entity's proposed and actual use of guaranteed loan funds, including, but not limited
to: 

(A) The amount of guaranteed loan funds expected to be made available for the coming year, including program income
anticipated to be generated by the activities carried out with guaranteed loan funds; 

(B) The range of activities that may be undertaken with guaranteed loan funds; 

(C) The estimated amount of guaranteed loan funds (including program income derived therefrom) proposed to be used
for activities that will benefit low and moderate income persons; 

(D) The proposed activities likely to result in displacement and the public entity's plans, consistent with the policies
developed under  570.606 or  570.488 for minimizing displacement of persons as a result of its proposed
activities. 

(ii) Providing technical assistance to groups representative of persons of low and moderate income that request
assistance in developing proposals. The level and type of assistance to be provided is at the discretion of the public
entity. Such assistance need not include the provision of funds to such groups. 

(iii) Holding a minimum of two public hearings, each at a different stage of the public entity's program, for the purpose
of obtaining the views of citizens and formulating or responding to proposals and questions. Together the hearings
must address community development and housing needs, development of proposed activities and review of program
performance. At least one of these hearings must be held before submission of the application to obtain the views of
citizens on community development and housing needs. Reasonable notice of the hearing must be provided and the hearing
must be held at times and locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries, with accommodation for the handicapped.
The public entity must specify in its plan how it will meet the requirement for a hearing at times and locations convenient
to potential or actual beneficiaries.

); and 
(B) The Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619). 
(vi) (A) (For entitlement public entities only.) In the aggregate, at least 70 percent of all CDBG funds, as defined

(ix) (Where applicable, the public entity may also include the following additional certification.) It lacks sufficient
resources from funds provided under this subpart or program income to allow it to comply with the provisions of  570.200(c)(2),
and it must therefore assess properties owned and occupied by moderate income persons, to recover the guaranteed
loan funded portion of the capital cost without paying such assessments in their behalf from guaranteed loan funds.

(x) It will comply with the other provisions of the Act and with other applicable laws. 
(9) In the case of an application submitted by a State-assisted public entity, certifications by the State that:

(iv) It agrees to assume the responsibilities described in  570.710. 
(c)

entity or State as warranted by such information. 
(2) The HUD Office shall review the application for compliance with requirements specified in this subpart and forward
the application together with its recommendation for approval or disapproval of the requested loan guarantee to
HUD Headquarters. 
(3) HUD may disapprove an application, or may approve loan guarantee assistance for an amount less than requested,
for any of the following reasons:

obligations of the borrower identified in the application subject to compliance with this part, including the requirements
under  570.705(b), (d), (g) and (h) for securing and issuing debt obligations, the conditions for release of
funds described in paragraph (d) of this section, and such other conditions as HUD may specify in the commitment documents
in a particular case. 

(5)

change the purpose, scope, location, or beneficiaries of an activity, the amendment must be approved by HUD. Amendments
by State-assisted public entities must also be approved by the State. The public entity shall follow the citizen participation
requirements for amendments in  570.704(a)(2).

 570.706 

Federal guarantee; subrogation.



The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under this subpart. Any
such guarantee made by HUD shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the debt obligations for such guarantee
with respect to principal and interest, and the validity of such guarantee so made shall be incontestable in the hands
of a holder of the guaranteed debt obligations. If HUD pays a claim under a guarantee made under section 108 of the Act,
HUD shall be fully subrogated for all the rights of the holder of the guaranteed debt obligation with respect to such
obligation.



 570.707 

Applicability of rules and regulations.



(a) 

Entitlement public entities. 

The provisions of subparts A, C, J, K and O of this part applicable to entitlement grants shall apply equally to guaranteed
loan funds and other CDBG funds, except to the extent they are specifically modified or augmented by the provisions
of this subpart.

(b) 

State-assisted public entities. 

The provisions of subpart I of this part, and the requirements the State imposes on units of general local government
receiving Community Development Block Grants or program income to the extent applicable, shall apply equally to
guaranteed loan funds and Community Development Block Grants (including program income derived therefrom) administered
by the State under the CDBG program, except to the extent they are specifically modified or augmented by the provisions
of this subpart.

(c) 

Nonentitlement public entities eligible under subpart F of this part. 

The provisions of subpart F of this part shall apply equally to guaranteed loan funds and other CDBG funds, except to
the extent they are specifically modified or augmented by the provisions of this subpart.



 570.708 

Sanctions.



(a) 

Non-State Assisted Public Entities. 

The performance review procedures described in subpart O of this part apply to all public entities receiving guaranteed
loan funds other than State-assisted public entities. Performance deficiencies in the use of guaranteed loan funds
made available to such public entities (or program income derived therefrom) or violations of the contract entered
into pursuant to  570.705(b)(1) may result in the imposition of a sanction authorized pursuant to  570.900(b)(7)
against pledged CDBG grants. In addition, upon a finding by HUD that the public entity has failed to comply substantially
with any provision of the Act with respect to either the pledged grants or the guaranteed loan funds or program income,
HUD may take action against the pledged grants as provided in  570.913 and/or may take action as provided in the
contract for loan guarantee assistance.

(b) 

State-assisted public entities. 

Performance deficiencies in the use of guaranteed loan funds (or program income derived therefrom) or violations
of the contract entered into pursuant to  570.705(b)(1) may result in an action authorized pursuant to  570.495
or  570.496. In addition, upon a finding by HUD that the State or public entity has failed to comply substantially
with any provision of the Act with respect to the pledged CDBG nonentitlement funds, the guaranteed loan funds, or
program income, HUD may take action against the pledged funds as provided in  570.496 and/or may take action
as provided in the contract.



 570.709 

Allocation of loan guarantee assistance.



Of the amount approved in any appropriation act for guarantees under this subpart in any fiscal year, 70 percent shall
be allocated for entitlement public entities and 30 percent shall be allocated for nonentitlement public entities.
HUD need not comply with these percentage requirements in any fiscal year to the extent that there is an absence of applications
approvable under this subpart from entitlement or nonentitlement public entities.



 570.710 

State responsibilities.



The State is responsible for choosing public entities that it will assist under this subpart. States are free to develop
procedures and requirements for determining which activities will be assisted, subject to the requirements of this
subpart. Upon approval by HUD of an application from a State-assisted public entity, the State will be principally
responsible, subject to HUD oversight under subpart I of this part, for ensuring that the public entity complies with
all applicable requirements governing the use of the guaranteed loan funds. Notwithstanding the State's responsibilities
described in this section, HUD may take any action necessary for ensuring compliance with requirements affecting
the security interests of HUD with respect to the guaranteed loan.

Policy on Employee Rescue Efforts




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Issuance of interpretive rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is issuing an interpretive regulation addressing the
agency's citation policy regarding voluntary employee rescue activities.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In carrying out its enforcement responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA from time to
time investigates workplace incidents which involve not only injuries to workers directly exposed to hazards, but
injuries and potential injuries to employees who voluntarily attempt to rescue or assist their fellow workers. OSHA
is aware of many instances in which employees have voluntarily rescued coworkers or rendered emergency assistance
in the aftermath of workplace accidents, sometimes at considerable risk to themselves. Until recently, there has
been no written instruction by OSHA to its field offices providing guidance in such situations. Accordingly, the
agency has decided to issue an interpretive rule clarifying its citation policy regarding employers whose employees
perform or attempt to perform rescues of individuals in life-threatening danger.




It is not OSHA's policy to interfere with or to regulate every decision by a worker to place himself at risk to save another
individual. Nor is it OSHA's policy to issue citations to employers whose employees voluntarily undertake acts of
heroism to save another individual from imminent harm, where rescue operations are not part of the employee's job
responsibilities and the likelihood that a rescue may become necessary is not reasonably foreseeable.

At the same time, employers who have employees working in environments where the possibility of life-threatening
accidents is reasonably foreseeable are required by various OSHA standards and the general duty clause to take appropriate
precautions to assure that the rescuers themselves do not become victims. 

See, e.g., Pride Oil Well Service, 

15 BNA-OSHC 1808 (Rev. Comm.1992); ARO. Inc., 1 BNA-OSHC 1453 (Rev. Com. 1973). Accidents requiring rescue
efforts are reasonably foreseeable in certain working environments such as, for example, trenches and excavations,
hazardous waste operations and emergency response work, or construction work over water. Confined spaces are another
occupational setting where rescuers, without proper equipment and precautions, often are killed or injured. ``Worker
Deaths in Confined Spaces: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports'', National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, No. 94-103 (1994).

Because the occurrence of accidents which invite rescue attempts is foreseeable in various industrial processes
and environments, a variety of OSHA standards include precautions and safeguards for rescue-related operations,
including, 

e.g., 

the emergency planning and response provisions of the process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119(n), and
hazardous waste operations standard, 29 CFR 1910.120(1), (p) and (q); and the standards on confined spaces in general
industry, 29 CFR 1910.146, and in grain handling, 1910.272(d), (e), and (g). In construction, specific rescue precautions
are prescribed, 

e.g., 

for work performed near or over water, and for excavation work, 29 CFR 1926.106, 1926.651(g). 

See also 

29 CFR 1910.38 (employee emergency plans in general industry) and 1926.20, .21, and .35 (training and emergency action
plans in construction).

Under the interpretive rule set forth below, these and other requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health
Act will be applied in situations involving employee rescue efforts only when the employer has specifically designated
an employee with responsibility to perform or assist in a rescue operation, or when employees have duties directly
related to workplace processes or operations where the possibility of life-threatening accidents is foreseeable.


Effect of the Interpretive Rule



The present interpretive rule is intended to make clear that no citation will be issued by OSHA to any employer, under
any OSHA standard or under the general duty clause, for any rescue activity by its employees except in the limited circumstances
discussed in the written policy statement to be codified in 29 CFR Part 1903. The rule is adopted as a general statement
of agency policy under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  553, and is an exercise of agency prosecutorial
discretion in carrying out its enforcement responsibilities under the OSH Act. The interpretive rule issued today
is not an exercise of standard-setting authority by OSHA; it does not require any additional compliance action by
employers beyond what is already required under existing OSHA standards and the general duty clause, nor does it relieve
employers of any obligations currently imposed by those requirements, including the responsibility to designate
and appropriately train and equip emergency personnel when required under specific safety and health standards.


Regulatory Impact Analysis



In accordance with Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) OSHA has assessed the potential impact of this
interpretive rule. Based on the guidelines set forth in the Executive Order, OSHA has concluded that the interpretation
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' which would necessitate furth
