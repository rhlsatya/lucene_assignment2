Background 



On May 16, 1994, Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., Hurst, Texas, applied for a Supplemental Type Certificate for installation
of an Electronic Flight Instrument System in the Bell Helicopter Textron (BHTI) Model 222U helicopter. This model
helicopter is a 10 passenger, 2 engine, 8,250 pound (Category B) or 7,850 pound (Category A) transport category helicopter.




Type Certification Basis 



The certification basis established for the BHTI Model 22U helicopter includes: 14 CFR 21.29 and part 29 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR) effective February 1, 1965 (Transport Categories A and B), Amendments 29-1 through
29-9; Amendment 29-11;  29.997 of Amendment 29-10;  29.927(b)(2) of Amendment 29-17;
  29.801, 29.25(c) 29.865, 29.1557(c), and 29.1555(c) of Amendment 29.12;   29.1, 29.79,
29.1517, and 29.1587 of Amendment 29-21; Criteria for Helicopter Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) certification
dated December 15, 1978; Exemption No. 2789,  29.811(h)(1) (following Amendment 24, effective December 6,
1984,  29.811(h)(1) became  29.811(f)(2)); and Exemption No. 4395,  29.855(a) and portions of
 29.855(d). 

If the Administration finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards for these helicopters because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed
under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.


Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by   11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.101(b)(2).




Discussion 



The BHTI Model 222U helicopter, at the time of the application for modification by Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., was identified
as incorporating one and possibly more electrical, electronic, or combination of electrical and electronic (electrical/electronic)
systems that will perform functions critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. The electronic
flight instrument system performs the attitude display function. The display of attitude, altitude, and airspeed
is critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters for IFR operations in instrument meteorological
conditions. After the design is finalized, Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., will provide the FAA with a preliminary hazard
that will identify any other critical functions performed by the electrical/electronic systems that are critical
to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. 

Recent advances in technology have prompted the design of aircraft that include advanced electrical and electronic
systems that perform functions required for continued safe flight and landing. However, these advanced systems
respond to the transient effects of induced electrical current and voltage caused by the high intensity radiated
fields (HIRF) incident on the external surface of the helicopters. These induced transient currents and voltages
can degrade the performance of the electrical/electronic systems by damaging the components or by upsetting the
systems' functions. 

Furthermore, the electromagnetic environment has undergone a transformation not envisioned by the current application
of  29.1309(a). Higher energy levels radiate from operational transmitters currently used for radar, radio,
and television; the number of transmitters has increased significantly. 

Existing aircraft certification requirements are inappropriate in view of these technological advances. In addition,
the FAA has received reports of some significant safety incidents and accidents involving military aircraft equipped
with advanced electrical/electronic systems when they were exposed to electromagnetic radiation. 

The combined effects of technological advances in helicopter design and the changing environment have resulted
in an increased level of vulnerability of the electrical and electronic systems required for the continued safe flight
and landing of the helicopters. Effective measures to protect these helicopters against the adverse effects of exposure
of HIRF will be provided by the design and installation of these systems. The following primary factors contributed
to the current conditions: (1) Increased use of sensitive electronics that perform critical functions, (2) reduced
electromagnetic shielding afforded helicopter systems by advanced technology airframe materials, (3) adverse
service experience of military aircraft using these technologies, and (4) an increase in the number and power of radio
frequency emitters and the expected increase in the future.

The FAA recognizes the need for aircraft certification standards to keep pace with technological developments and
a changing environment and, in 1986, initiated a high priority program to (1) determine and define electromagnetic
energy levels; (2) develop guidance material for design, test, and analysis; and (3) prescribe and promulgate regulatory
standards. The FAA participated with industry and airworthiness authorities of other countries to develop internationally
recognized standards for certification.

The FAA and airworthiness authorities of other countries have identified a level of HIRF environment that a helicopter
could be exposed to during IFR operations. While the HIRF requirements are being finalized, the FAA is adopting a special
condition for the certification of aircraft that employ electrical/electronic systems that perform critical functions.
The accepted maximum energy levels that civilian helicopter system installations must withstand for safe operation
are based on surveys and analysis of existing radio frequency emitters. This special condition will require the helicopters'
electrical/electronic systems and associated wiring to be protected from these energy levels. These external threat
levels are believed to represent the worst-case exposure for a helicopter operating under IFR.

The HIRF environment specified in this proposed special condition is based on many critical assumptions. With the
exception of takeoff and landing at an airport, one of these assumptions is the aircraft would be not less than 500 feet
above ground level (AGL). Helicopters operating under visual flight rules (VFR) routinely operate at less than 500
feet AGL and perform takeoffs and landings at locations other than controlled airports. Therefore, it would be expected
that the HIRF environment experienced by a helicopter operating VFR may exceed the defined environment by 100 percent
or more.

This special condition will require the systems that perform critical functions, as installed in the aircraft, to
meet certain standards based on either a defined HIRF environment or a fixed value using laboratory tests.

The applicant may demonstrate that the operation and operational capability of the installed electrical/electronic
systems that perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the aircraft is exposed to the defined HIRF
environment. The FAA has determined that the environment defined in Table 1 is acceptable for critical functions
in helicopters operating at or above 500 feet AGL. For critical functions of helicopters operating at less than 500
feet AGL, additional factors must be considered.

The applicant may also demonstrate by a laboratory test that the electrical/electronic systems that perform critical
functions can withstand a peak electromagnetic field strength in a frequency range of 10 KH

Z

 to 18 GH

Z

. If a laboratory test is used to show compliance with the defined HIRF environment, no credit will be given for signal
attenuation due to installation. A level of 100 v/m and other considerations, such as an alternate technology backup
that is immune to HIRF, are appropriate for critical functions during IFR operations. A level of 200 v/m and further
considerations, such as an alternate technology backup that is immune to HIRF, are more appropriate for critical
functions during VFR operations.

Applicants must perform a preliminary hazard analysis to identify electrical/electronic systems that perform
critical functions. The term ``critical'' means those functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure
condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. The systems identified by
the hazard analysis as performing critical functions are required to have HIRF protection.

A system may perform both critical and noncritical functions. Primary electronic flight display systems and their
associated components perform critical functions such as attitude, altitude, and airspeed indications. HIRF requirements
would apply only to the systems that perform critical functions.

Compliance with HIRF requirements will be demonstrated by tests, analysis, models, similarity with existing systems,
or a combination of these methods. The two basic options of either testing the rotorcraft to the defined environment
or laboratory testing may not be combined. The laboratory test allows some frequency areas to be under tested and requires
other areas to have some safety margin when compared to the defined environment. The areas required to have some safety
margin are those that have been, by past testing, shown to exhibit greater susceptibility to adverse effects from
HIRF; and laboratory tests, in general, do not accurately represent the aircraft installation. Service experience
alone will not be acceptable since such experience in normal flight operations may not include an exposure to HIRF.
Reliance on a system with similar design features for redundancy, as a means of protection against the effects of external
HIRF, is generally insufficient because all elements of a redundant system are likely to be concurrently exposed
to the radiated fields.

The modulation that represents the signal most likely to disrupt the operation of the system under test, based on its
design characteristics, should be selected. For example, flight control systems may be susceptible to 3 H

Z

 square wave modulation while the video signals for electronic display systems may be susceptible to 400 H

Z

 sinusoidal modulation. If the worst-case modulation is unknown or cannot be determined, default modulations may
be used. Suggested default values are a 1 KH

Z

 sine wave with 80 percent depth of modulation in the frequency range from 10 KH

Z

 to 400 MH

Z

 and 1 KH

Z

 square wave with greater than 90 percent depth of modulation from 400 MH

Z

 to 18 GH

Z

. For frequencies where the unmodulated signal would cause deviations from normal operation, several different
modulating signals with various waveforms and frequencies should be applied.

Acceptable system performance would be attained by demonstrating that the critical function components of the system
under consideration continue to perform their intended function during and after exposure to required electromagnetic
fields. Deviations from system specifications may be acceptable but must be independently assessed by the FAA on
a case-by-case basis.

Discussion 



The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. The DGAC
advises that one operator found leakage from some of the hydraulic pipe fittings on one airplane after a lightning
strike. Investigation revealed that the electrical bonding of the hydraulic pipe fittings and actuator servo control
units of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) has insufficient protection from a lightning strike. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in the loss of the pilot's ability to control the moveable surfaces of the THS, which
could adversely affect the controllability of the airplane. 

Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320-29-1058, dated July 16, 1993, which describes procedures for
modification of the THS. This modification involves installing bonding leads across all return hydraulic pipe fittings
in the THS area and across the actuator return line elbows. This modification also involves replacing the existing
clamps with items of increased electrical conductivity. 

Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320-27-1041, Revision 2, dated April 20, 1994, which describes
procedures for modification of the THS. This modification involves installing bonding plates and leads between
the elevator and the THS, and bonding leads between the actuator bodies and the THS bonding strip. This modification
also connects bonding leads to the return hydraulic pipes across all the fittings in the THS area.

Accomplishment of both of these modifications will improve the electrical 
bonding protection on the THS. The DGAC classified these service bulletins as 
mandatory and issued French AD 93-123-046 (B), dated August 4, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness
of these airplanes in France. 

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for 
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29)
and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the
DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the THS. The actions would be
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 

The FAA estimates that 99 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
13 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $77,220, or $780 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Discussion 



The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320-111, -211, and
-212 series airplanes powered by CFM 56-5A engines equipped with an electrical harness assembly having
part number (P/N) 238W0908-513. The DGAC advises it has received a report indicating that traces of fungus and
corrosion have been found on the electrical harness junction box (transition box) of the thrust reverser. Investigation
revealed that moisture ingressed into the electrical harness junction box and associated wiring. The effects of
such moisture subsequently could corrode the electrical harness junction box. This condition, if not detected and
corrected in a timely manner, could result in multiple faults in the thrust reverser position indication, and subsequent
uncontrolled reduction of engine power. 


Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320-71-1011, dated November 17, 1993, 
which describes procedures for modification of the junction box and connector backshells of the electrical harness
assembly having P/N 238W0908-513. This modification involves sealing the junction box, replacing the existing
aluminum backshells with stainless steel backshells, and checking the insulation of the electrical harness. The
DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French AD 94-030-050(B), dated February
2, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for 
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29)
and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the
DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States.

altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA 
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides
for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 

The FAA estimates that 50 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
24 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by ROHR, Inc. (the manufacturer of the junction box, connector backshells, and the
electrical harness assembly) at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $72,000, or $1,440 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Discussion



The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
it received a report that the autothrottle system on a Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplane disengaged suddenly while
the airplane was on approach for landing. The thrust levers could not be moved, and the ailerons were blocked in the
``NEUTRAL'' position. After recycling the flight control lock (FCL) system to the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED''
position, the thrust levers and ailerons were free to move again. The thrust levers are linked to the FCL system to prevent
takeoff revolutions per minute (RPM) from being selected if the FCL system is locked.

Investigation revealed that a takeoff configuration warning for the FCL system may not be generated, despite the
fact that the FCL handle is not in the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED'' position. On some aircraft, the operating forces
then may be insufficient to drive the handle back into the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED'' position, and the flight control
surface could lock unexpectedly during flight. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent engagement
of the FCL and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.

Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100-27-051, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994, which describes procedures
for replacement of the FCL handle and switch with a modified unit. Accomplishment of this installation will ensure
that a takeoff configuration warning for the FCL system is generated if the handle is not latched in the ``UNLOCKED''
position. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Netherlands airworthiness directive
BLA No. 93-088 (A), dated July 12, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in
the Netherlands.

This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require replacement of the FCL handle and switch with
a modified unit. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described
previously.

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.

The FAA estimates that 75 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required
parts would cost approximately $1,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $88,500, or $1,180 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Form G-FIN-4 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed form amendments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is proposing amendments to Form G-FIN-4, which is the
form that associated persons of financial institutions that are government securities brokers and dealers are required
to file with such financial institutions, pursuant to sections 15C(b)(1)(B) and (b)(4) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78

o

-5(b)(1)(B) and(b)(4)) and sections 400.4 and 449.3 of the regulations issued under the Government Securities
Act of 1986 (``GSA'').
 The amendments would update the disciplinary background provisions of the form to reflect amendments to the federal
securities laws, and would provide the financial institutions of the associated persons and the appropriate regulatory
authorities for the financial institutions with more useful information.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background and Analysis 


The Department adopted Form G-FIN-4 (Disclosure Form for Person Associated with a Financial Institution
Government Securities Broker or Dealer) in the implementing regulations for the GSA issued on July 24, 1987 (52 FR
27910). Sections 400.4 and 449.3
 of the GSA regulations require the form to be used by associated persons of financial institutions that are government
securities brokers and dealers to provide the financial institution and the appropriate regulatory agency with
certain information concerning employment, residence and statutory disqualification. Under the GSA regulations,
associated persons that have a current Form U-4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration
or Transfer) or Form MSD-4 (Uniform Application for Municipal Securities Principal or Municipal Securities
Representative Associated with a Bank Municipal Securities Dealer) on file with their financial institution are
not required to file Form G-FIN-4. Associated persons are not required to file G-FIN-4 forms
with their financial institutions that are exempt from filing notice as government securities brokers or dealers
pursuant to part 401 of the GSA regulations. 





The proposed changes to the body of Form G-FIN-4 relate to Item 17, which requests information concerning
the disciplinary history of the associated person. The changes are being made to reflect amendments to the Exchange
Act by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Remedies Act'')
 and the International Securities Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1990 (``ISECA'').
 The Remedies Act gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') the authority to seek civil monetary penalties
in court proceedings and to impose monetary penalties and order disgorgement in administrative proceedings. The
Remedies Act also provided the SEC with both temporary and permanent cease and desist order authority to prevent violations
of securities laws. The ISECA gave the SEC the authority to bar, suspend or restrict the activities of broker-dealers
and the associated persons or those persons seeking to become associated with a broker-dealer, based upon the findings
of a foreign court or foreign securities authority. By amending the GSA, the ISECA also gave similar authority to the
appropriate regulatory agencies for financial institutions that are government securities brokers or dealers
regarding associated persons or those persons seeking to become associated with such entities.
 The ISECA added a definition of the term ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' to section 3(a) of the Exchange
Act,
 and provided that certain types of actions taken by foreign financial regulatory authorities will be deemed a statutory
disqualification.

Specifically, the amendments to Form G-FIN-4 would amend question C of Item 17 to add paragraph (5), which
would ask the associated person whether the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') has ever imposed
a civil money penalty on the associated person, or ordered the associated person to cease and desist from any activity.
The new inquiry would require a yes or no response, and if the response is yes, details must be provided, as is currently
required for any affirmative response in Item 17. The disclosure of this additional information would correspond
to the SEC's expanded administrative and civil enforcement authorities under the Remedies Act. 

The amendments to Form G-FIN-4 would also add a definition of ``foreign financial regulatory authority''
to Item 17, and would add this term to question 17.D. Thus, question 17.D would now inquire whether any federal regulatory
agency, any state regulatory agency or ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' has ever found the associated
person to have: made a false statement or omission or been dishonest, unfair or unethical; been involved in a violation
of investment regulations or statutes; been the cause of an investment-related business having its authorization
to do business denied, suspended, revoked or restricted; been subject to an order concerning investment-related
activity; had its registration or license denied, suspended, or revoked, or otherwise been prevented from associating
with an investment-related business, or been disciplined by the restriction of its activities; or had its license
as an attorney, accountant or federal contractor suspended. The definition of ``foreign financial regulatory authority''
which would be added to Form G-FIN-4 is essentially the definition the ISECA added to section 3(a)(52)
of the Exchange Act. Questions 17.A and 17.B would be amended to clarify that the inquiries now apply to information
related to foreign as well as domestic courts. 

The amendments would modify Item 5 to reflect the Office of Thrift Supervision as the successor to the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board. Thus, the ``Director, Office of Thrift Supervision'' would now be listed as one of the appropriate
regulatory agencies with which the financial institutions may be required to file the form. 

In light of the technical changes made by the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 to the definition of ``appropriate
regulatory agency'',
 these amendments would also make corresponding changes to Item 3 of the general instructions for Form G-FIN-4.






These amendments would ensure that Form G-FIN-4 will provide a more complete description of the associated
person's disciplinary history. The amendments to Form G-FIN-4 would also conform to similar changes
made by the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') to Form U-4 in November, 1991,
 and by the SEC to Form BD (Uniform Application for Broker-Dealer Registration) in July, 1992.
 The Treasury was unable to propose amendments to Form G-FIN-4 at the same time the NASD and SEC made changes
to their respective forms since its rulemaking authority under the GSA expired on October 1, 1991, and was not reauthorized
until December 17, 1993.
 







If the Department adopts the amendments to Form G-FIN-4 as proposed, associated persons of financial
institutions that are government securities brokers or dealers would need to file amendments to their existing Form
G-FIN-4 to the extent that any information is inaccurate or incomplete. Associated persons would need
to review their current Form G-FIN-4 filings to determine whether the forms contain all the information
required by these amendments, and if not, the associated person would need to file an amendment to their G-FIN-4
with the updated information. An appropriate transition period would be provided for associated persons to file
any required updates. 



II. Special Analysis 



Based on the very limited impact of the proposed amendments, it is the Department's view that the proposed changes
to Form G-FIN-4 are not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of Executive Order 12866.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

), it is hereby certified that the amendments to Form G-FIN-4, if adopted, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities and, as a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.


The collection of information in these proposed amendments to Form G-FIN-4 is contained in revised Items
5 and 17 of the form. Form G-FIN-4 is required to be submitted by associated persons of financial institutions
that are government securities brokers and dealers, in accordance with   400.4 and 449.3. The collection
of information is intended to give the financial institutions and the appropriate regulatory authorities of the
financial institutions a more complete and meaningful description of the disciplinary history of the associated
person. The rule applies only to associated persons of financial institutions that are not exempt from filing notice
as government securities brokers and dealers. 

Although the Department is proposing to add a new paragraph to an existing question and modify several other questions
on Form G-FIN-4, and cannot be certain as to the exact impact on associated persons completing the form,
it does believe that the changes will not have more than a 

de minimis

 effect on the amount of time necessary to complete the form. The Department's most recent Paperwork Reduction Act
Filing with respect to Form G-FIN-4 shows an annual estimate of 800 respondents filing once per year, with
a burden of two hours per respondent. No modification is projected to the reporting burden. 

The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) requires that collections of information prescribed in proposed
rules be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval. Since these proposed amendments
result in no increase in burden hours to complete Form G-FIN-4 and more importantly do not represent any
program change, the submission described in the Paperwork Reduction Act is inapplicable. 



List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 449 



Banks, Banking, Brokers, Government securities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.




For the reasons set out in the preamble, it is proposed to amend 17 CFR part 449 as follows:

Netting Rule for Certain Conversion Transactions 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public 
hearing. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The proposed regulations relate to the amount of gain 
from a conversion transaction position that is subject to 
recharacterization as ordinary income. The proposed regulations 
provide that certain gains and losses from positions of the same 
conversion transaction may be netted for purposes of determining 
the amount of gain that is recharacterized as ordinary income. 
These proposed regulations reflect changes to the law made by the 
Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 and affect persons who enter 
into conversion transactions. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act 


The collections of information contained in this notice of 
proposed rulemaking have been submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collections 
of information should be sent to the Office of Management and 
Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 
20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS 
Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224. 
The collections of information are in  1.1258-1(b)(2). 
This information is required by the IRS to aid in administering 
the law and to prevent manipulation of the netting rules through 
the use of hindsight. This information will be used to determine 
whether the taxpayer has elected to net losses against gains 
before applying section 1258(a) and to verify that the taxpayer 
is properly reporting its conversion transactions that are 
subject to netting. The likely recordkeepers are business or 
other for-profit institutions and nonprofit institutions. 



Estimated total annual recordkeeping burden: 5,000 hours. 
The estimated annual burden per recordkeeper varies from .05 to 
10.00 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an 
estimated average of .10 hour. 
Estimated number of recordkeepers: 50,000. 


Background 


This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax 
Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 1258(a) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986. Section 1258 was added to the Code by 
section 13206(a) of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. 
Section 1258 treats certain capital gains from conversion 
transactions as ordinary income. A transaction is a conversion 
transaction if substantially all of the taxpayer's expected 
return is attributable to the time value of the taxpayer's net 
investment in the transaction and the transaction falls within 
one of four categories. The four categories of covered 
transactions are (1) acquiring property and substantially 
contemporaneously entering into a contract to sell that (or 
substantially identical) property, (2) applicable straddles, (3) 
transactions marketed or sold as producing capital gains, and (4) 
transactions specified in regulations. 
Gain generated by any position of a conversion transaction 
is treated as ordinary income to the extent of the applicable 
imputed income amount (AIIA). The AIIA is equal to the 
taxpayer's net investment in the transaction multiplied by the 
applicable rate, with certain adjustments. The applicable rate 
is generally 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate, 
determined as if the conversion transaction were a debt 
instrument.

Explanation of Provisions 


A. Overview 


The purpose of section 1258 is to treat the time value 
income from conversion transactions as ordinary income. Section 
1258(a) may create a character mismatch, however, because it 
focuses only on the gain recognized on the transaction. If a 
taxpayer separately disposes of the positions of a conversion 
transaction, the taxpayer's inability to net losses on the 
positions against gains could result in the recharacterization of 
gain in excess of the time value element. 
For example, assume that a taxpayer buys a capital asset for 
$100 and simultaneously sells that asset forward for $105 in one 
year. Assume that the AIIA is $8. If the asset were delivered 
to close out the forward contract, the taxpayer would have a $5 
capital gain. Even though the AIIA is $8, no more than the $5 
gain would be recharacterized. 
Assume, instead, that the taxpayer sells the asset and 
closes out the forward contract in separate transactions when the 
value of the asset has dropped to $97. Gain subject to 
recharacterization under section 1258(a), determined separately 
for each position, is $8 on the forward contract. If the $3 loss 
on the asset were not netted against that $8 gain prior to 
applying section 1258(a), the full $8 gain would be 
recharacterized as ordinary income. This recharacterization 
would force the taxpayer to recognize $8 of ordinary income and 
$3 of non-offsetting capital loss. 
The proposed regulations provide relief from this potential 
character mismatch in certain circumstances. 


B. Specific Provisions 


The proposed regulations allow taxpayers to net gains and 
losses on the positions of certain conversion transactions for 
purposes of section 1258(a). To be eligible, the taxpayer must 
identify, before the close of the day on which the positions 
become part of the conversion transaction, all the positions that 
are part of the conversion transaction. In addition, the 
taxpayer must dispose of all the positions within a 14-day period 
that is within a single taxable year. 
The proposed regulations also provide special rules for 
losses on positions of conversion transactions. These rules 
prevent the netting of built-in loss against gain. In addition, 
the rules treat certain losses that arise during the term of a 
conversion transaction as built-in losses. 
These regulations are proposed to be effective for 
conversion transactions entered into on or after the date of the 
filing of the final regulations with the 

Federal Register

. 


C. Solicitation of Comments on Other Issues 


The scope of the relief provided by the proposed regulations 
would be broadened if a taxpayer could elect to treat retained 
positions of a conversion transaction as if they were sold for 
their fair market values whenever another position of that 
transaction was disposed of, terminated, or treated as sold under 
any other provision of the Code or regulations. The proposed 
regulations do not include such a mark-to-market provision. 
Marking positions to market raises a number of issues under other 
provisions of the Code (for example, sections 1271 through 1278). 
The Service solicits comments on the necessity for and terms of a 
mark-to-market provision under section 1258. 

The Service is aware that section 1258 presents a number of 
issues not addressed by the proposed regulations. The Service 
invites comments concerning which, if any, of these issues should 
be addressed in future regulations. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be 
submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 


Comments and Public Hearing 


Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted 
timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public 
inspection and copying.

Proposed Amendments to the Regulations 





Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is proposed to be amended as 
follows: 




PART 1_INCOME TAXES 







Paragraph 1. 

The authority citation for part 1 continues to 
read in part as follows: 






Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * 








Par. 2. 

Section 1.1258-1 is added to read as follows: 




 1.1258-1

Netting rule for certain conversion transactions. 





(a) 

Purpose. 

The purpose of this section is to provide 
taxpayers with a method to net certain gains and losses from 
positions of the same conversion transaction before determining 
the amount of gain treated as ordinary income under section 
1258(a). 



(b) 

Netting of gain and loss for identified transactions_

(1) 

In general. 

If a taxpayer disposes of or terminates all the 
positions of an identified netting transaction (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section) within a 14-day period in a 
single taxable year, all gains and losses on those positions 
realized within that period (other than built-in losses as 
defined in paragraph (c) of this section) are netted solely for 
purposes of determining the amount of gain treated as ordinary 
income under section 1258(a). A taxpayer is treated as disposing 
of any position that is treated as sold under any provision of 
the Code or regulations thereunder (for example, under section 
1256(a)(1)). 



(2) 

Identified netting transaction. 

For purposes of this 
section, an identified netting transaction is a conversion 
transaction (as defined in section 1258(c)) that the taxpayer 
identifies as an identified netting transaction on its books and 
records. Identification of each position of the conversion 
transaction must be made before the close of the day on which the 
position becomes part of the conversion transaction. No 
particular form of identification is necessary, but all the 
positions of a single conversion transaction must be identified 
as part of the same transaction and must be distinguished from 
all other positions. 



(c) 

Definition of built-in loss. 

For purposes of this 
section, built-in loss can arise in two situations. First, 
built-in loss as defined in section 1258(d)(3)(B) is built-in 
loss. Second, if a taxpayer realizes gain or loss on any one 
position of a conversion transaction (for example, under section 
1256) and, as of the date that gain or loss is realized, there is 
unrealized loss in any other position of the conversion 
transaction that is not disposed of, terminated, or treated as 
sold under any provision of the Code or regulations thereunder 
within 14 days of and within the same taxable year as the 
realization event, that unrealized loss is built-in loss. See 
paragraph (d) 

Example 3 

of this section.

(d) 

Examples. 

These examples illustrate this section: 





Example 1. Identified netting transaction with simultaneous 
actual dispositions. 

(i) On December 1, 1995, 

A

 purchases 1,000 
shares of XYZ stock for $100,000 and enters into a forward 
contract to sell 1,000 shares of XYZ stock on November 30, 1997, 
for $110,000. The XYZ stock is actively traded as defined in 
 1.1092(d)-1(a) and is a capital asset in 

A

's hands. 

A

 
maintains books and records on which, on December 1, 1995, it 
identifies the two positions as all the positions of a single 
conversion transaction. A owns no other XYZ stock. On December 
1, 1996, when the applicable imputed income amount for the 
transaction is $7,000, 

A

 sells the 1,000 shares of XYZ stock for 
$95,000. On the same day, 

A

 terminates its forward contract by 
entering into an offsetting position, receiving $10,200. 
(ii) The XYZ stock and forward contract are positions of a 
conversion transaction. Under section 1258(c)(1), substantially 
all of A's expected return from the overall transaction is 
attributable to the time value of the net investment in the 
transaction. Under section 1258(c)(2)(B), the transaction is an 
applicable straddle as defined in section 1258(d)(1). 
(iii) 

A

 disposed of or terminated all the positions of the 
conversion transaction within 14 days and within the same taxable 
year as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The 
transaction is an identified netting transaction because it meets 
the identification requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. Solely for purposes of section 1258(a), the $5,000 loss 
realized ($100,000 basis less $95,000 amount realized) on the 
disposition of the XYZ stock is netted against the $10,200 gain 
recognized on the disposition of the forward contract. Thus, the 
net gain from the conversion transaction for purposes of section 
1258(a) is $5,200 ($10,200 gain less $5,000 loss). Only the 
$5,200 net gain is recharacterized as ordinary income under 
section 1258(a) even though the applicable imputed income amount 
is $7,000. For federal tax purposes other than section 1258(a), 


A

 has recognized a $10,200 gain on the disposition of the forward 
contract ($5,200 of which is treated as ordinary income) and 
realized a separate $5,000 loss on the sale of the XYZ stock. 


Example 2. Identified netting transaction with built-in 
loss. 

(i) The facts are the same as in 

Example 1

, except that 

A

 
had purchased the XYZ stock for $104,000 on May 15, 1995. The 
XYZ stock had a fair market value of $100,000 on December 1, 
1995, the date it became part of a conversion transaction. 
(ii) The results are the same as in 

Example 1

, except that A 
has built-in loss (in addition to the $5,000 loss that arose 
economically during the period of the conversion transaction), as 
defined in section 1258(d)(3)(B), of $4,000 on the XYZ stock. 
That $4,000 built-in loss is not netted against the $10,200 gain 
on the forward contract for purposes of section 1258(a). Thus, 
the net gain from the conversion transaction for purposes of 
section 1258(a) is $5,200, the same as in 

Example 1

. The $4,000 
built-in loss is recognized and has a character determined 
without regard to section 1258. 


Example 3. Identified netting transaction with position 
marked to market. 

(i) 

B

, a calendar year taxpayer, holds a 
portfolio of Treasury securities that are capital assets in 

B

's 
hands. On December 1, 1995, 

B

 enters into a short futures 
contract on Treasury securities that is a regulated futures 
contract (RFC) as defined in section 1256(g)(1). Although the 
RFC and some portion of 

B

's portfolio of Treasury securities (the 
conversion Treasuries) constitute a straddle as defined in 
section 1092(c), 

B

 does not make an election under section 
1256(d) to have section 1256 not apply to the RFC, nor does 

B

 
make any identification or election under  1.1092(b)-3T or 
 1.1092(b)-4T (relating to certain identified mixed straddles or 
mixed straddle accounts, respectively). 

B

 maintains books and 
records on which, on December 1, 1995, it identifies the 
conversion Treasuries and the RFC as all the positions of a 
single conversion transaction. 
(ii) As of December 29, 1995, the last business day of the 
taxable year, 

B

 has an unrealized loss on the conversion 
Treasuries of $8,000, wholly attributable to the period beginning 
December 1, 1995, and ending December 29, 1995, and an unrealized 
gain on the RFC of $8,800. Under section 1256, 

B

 marks the RFC 
to market as of December 29, 1995. 

B

 continues to hold the 
conversion Treasuries. 
(iii) The conversion Treasuries and RFC are positions of a 
conversion transaction. Under section 1258(c)(1), substantially 
all of 

B

's expected return from the overall transaction is 
attributable to the time value of the net investment in the 
transaction. Under section 1258(c)(2)(B), the transaction is an 
applicable straddle as defined in section 1258(d)(1). 
(iv) The transaction is an identified netting transaction 
because it meets the identification requirement of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does 
not apply to the transaction, however, because 

B

 did not dispose 
of or terminate all the positions of the conversion transaction 
within the same 14-day period in the same taxable year. There 
has been no disposition or termination of the conversion 
Treasuries by December 31, 1995, the end of 

B

's taxable year in 
which it is treated as having sold the RFC. 
(v) The $8,000 excess of 

B

's basis in the conversion 
Treasuries over their fair market value on December 29, 1995, is 
built-in loss under paragraph (c) of this section. Under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that $8,000 built-in loss is 
not available to offset later gain on the positions. 




(e) 

Effective date. 

This section is effective for 
conversion transactions entered into on or after the date of the 
filing of the final regulations with the 

Federal Register

Public regulatory conference; date and location change, format and extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

By notice published on November 18, 1994 (59 FR 59744), FRA scheduled a public regulatory conference for January 9-13,
1995, at the Executive Inn in Sacramento, California, to allow interested parties the opportunity to further discuss
issues related to its notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on railroad accident reporting. The location for this
public regulatory conference has been changed to Washington, D.C. and the dates have been changed to Monday, January
30, 1995 through no later than Friday, February 3, 1995. FRA is also extending the comment period on the accident reporting
NPRM to March 10, 1995.

Time: beginning at 9:00 a.m. each day.
Persons desiring to attend the conference should notify the Docket Clerk in writing at the above address or by telephone
at (202) 366-2257 by close of business January 27, 1995.



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
(I) History and Purpose


Following publication of the NPRM on accident reporting in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 42880), FRA conducted a series of public hearings to obtain the industry's views and comments on specific issues
addressed in the NPRM. Public hearings were held in Washington, D.C. on October 5-6; in Kansas City, Missouri
on October 19; and in Portland, Oregon on November 3. FRA examined the issues and interests involved and made a preliminary
inquiry among the hearing participants to determine whether additional hearings or regulatory meetings could be
successful in narrowing areas of disagreement and exploring possible accommodations. Most participants expressed
interest in continuing the rulemaking process by holding additional or supplementary regulatory meetings, roundtables
or workshops. After further deliberation, FRA decided that an informal public regulatory conference would prove
advantageous in the development of the accident reporting regulations. FRA also believes that the quality of the
agency's final rule will be improved by facilitating an exchange of ideas that may lead to solutions acceptable to
all interested groups.


(II) Methodology


In accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 

et seq.

), the public regulatory conference is a continuation of the accident reporting rulemaking proceeding. A court reporter
will take a verbatim transcript of the conference which will be placed in the public docket for this rulemaking. The
format of the discussions will be informal and will employ a topical, interactive approach. The public regulatory
conference is currently scheduled for one week. FRA believes the time allotted for this conference will prove more
than adequate. Of course, the conference will conclude earlier than initially planned if a majority of participants
in attendance agree that the key issues have been adequately addressed.


(III) Participants


FRA invites all affected parties, including small entities, to participate in the public regulatory conference.
FRA believes that extensive comment from all interested parties is necessary to develop the most effective and reasonable
final regulation. For this conference to be successful, participants should come prepared to discuss, at a minimum,
the key issues identified below and to suggest reasonable alternatives to the various proposals in the NPRM. FRA also
encourages participants to bring supporting documentation where appropriate.


(IV) Key Issues


A number of issues were raised in the written comments received to date and at the public hearings. We encourage interested
parties to come prepared to respond to the following questions and to make any other comments or suggestions regarding
the issues presented. Please note that the conference is not limited to these issues. FRA does retain the authority,
however, to limit the issues discussed at the regulatory conference.


A. Internal Control Plans (Proposed Section 225.33)


The regulation proposed by FRA would require railroads to maintain written internal control plans for the preparation
of reports required under part 225. Most railroad commenters believe the internal control plan in proposed  225.33
is burdensome and recommend that a performance standard of 99-percent be established to replace the internal control
plan. Dividing the number of reported accidents or incidents by the number of actual reportable accidents or incidents
would yield a number (percentage) that would then be compared against the 99-percent performance level to determine
actual performance by the railroad.
(1) Would a performance standard system, in lieu of the proposed internal control plan, ensure FRA receives reliable
and consistent reporting data?

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-1-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) How should FRA address accountability and enforceability if the carrier does not meet the 99-percent standard?
(3) If a performance standard were adopted by FRA, penalties might be assessed based upon actual performance by the
railroad. Such a penalty would increase geometrically for each percentage point below the 99-percent performance
level, 

i.e., 

$1,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 98-percent level; $3,000 penalty assessment for performance at
the 97-percent level; $9,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 96-percent level, etc. Please comment on
this sliding-scale approach.
(4) FRA has determined that a 100-percent verification of reporting for a major railroad is not practicable given
the size of its current work force. Even 100-percent verification at a small facility might not be feasible. What is
the minimum sample size that would be required before a performance standard should be applied?
(5) The Association of American Railroads (AAR) acknowledged and agreed that most of its members already have internal
control plans in place. Please describe these plans in detail.
(6) If FRA determines that a written internal control plan is in fact necessary, how would you modify the existing proposal?
(7) Should the regulation indicate that the internal control plan be continuously updated and maintained?


B. Magnetic Media Submissions (Proposed Section 225.37)


The proposed rule allows railroads the option of reporting data by way of magnetic media in lieu of paper forms. Please
refer to proposed  225.37.
(1) Would substitute forms be acceptable for verification when a railroad submits magnetic media?
(2) What would be the railroad cost differentials for developing a new computer format or modifying an existing one?
(3) Should ``railroad-designed formats'' for the various reporting forms be allowed? How would this be accomplished?


C. Definitions (Proposed Section 225.5)


FRA proposed several new definitions in  225.5. Those new definitions warranting further discussion are listed
below.


1. ``Worker on Duty''


FRA proposed that a ``worker on duty'' be defined to include individuals who receive monetary compensation from the
reporting railroad, or who are engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other rail safety-sensitive
function for reporting railroad as described in  209.303.
Similarly, a ``volunteer'' would be sort of service for the reporting railroad without receiving direct monetary
compensation from that railroad and are not engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other
rail safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad as described in  209.303.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-1-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Should ``contractors'' and ``volunteers'' in safety-sensitive positions be reported separately from ``workers
on duty''?
(b) Should a separate classification for ``employees'' remain?
(c) A ``contractor'' is currently a separate classification for reporting purposes. If FRA should decide to delete
the proposed ``worker on duty'' classification, should ``volunteer'' be added as a separate classification?
(d) How would ``hours worked'' be calculated for contractors and volunteers involved in safety-sensitive functions?
Should these hours be listed separately?


2. ``Establishment'' and ``Posted''


As proposed in the NPRM, an ``establishment'' would be defined as a single physical location where business is conducted
or where services or operations are performed, for example, an operating division, general office, and major installation,
such as a locomotive or care repair or construction facility. FRA also proposed in  225.25(e) that each railroad
``post'' a listing of all reported injuries and illnesses for the previous month at each ``establishment.''
(a) If FRA determines that the proposed ``posting'' requirement is in fact necessary, how would you redefine ``establishment''
such that any burden to the railroad is minimized?
(b) Should each railroad be required to identify a ``recordkeeping establishment''?
(c) Should the proposed list of definitions include one for ``posted''? Should that definition encompass ``electronic
posting,'' wherein railroad workers may view accident and injury logs via computer? Where computers are not available
at establishments, manual posting would remain a requirement. Please comment.


3. ``Qualified Health Care Professional'' and ``Medical Treatment''


As proposed, a ``qualified health care professional'' is defined as a health care professional operating within
the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification. For example, an otolaryngologist is qualified to
diagnose a case of noise-induced hearing loss and to identify potential causal factors, but may not be qualified to
diagnose a case of silicosis.
(a) Should the definition be narrowed so as to include only people with a medical degree, 

i.e.,

 an M.D.? Should the definition be expanded to include additional individuals (

e.g.,

 physical therapists) as qualified health care professionals?
(b) Should a railroad's employee assistance officer (EAP) be considered a ``qualified health care professional''
when he or she provides counseling to an employee who has experienced traumatic stress from involvement in a serious
or fatal accident?
As proposed, ``medical treatment'' would include any medical care or treatment beyond ``first aid'' regardless
of who provides such treatment. Medical treatment does not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays and drawing
blood samples.

(a) Are there other definitions of ``medical treatment'' that could clarify reportability?


D. Injury/Illness Reportability


(1) How are cases involving alleged noise-induced hearing loss by employees subjected to review or evaluation within
companies to determine whether FRA reportability criteria have been met?
(2) Does the railroad's reporting officer determine reportability of noise-induced hearing loss or is this determination
made by another employee (

e.g.

, industrial hygienist, supervisor)? If the ``reportability'' decision is made by someone other than the reporting
officer, how is this decision conveyed to the reporting officer?
(3) Should the proposed internal control plan indicate how the review of an alleged noise-induced hearing loss case
is accomplished?


E. ``Recordable'' Injury/Illness


FRA proposed to define ``recordable'' injury or illness as intending to encompass any condition, not otherwise reportable,
of a railroad worker that is associated with an event, exposure, or activity in the work environment that causes or
requires the worker to be examined or treated by a qualified health care professional. Such treatment would usually
occur at a location other than the work environment.
(1) Does this proposed definition of ``recordable'' result in greater risk of a railroad supervisor exerting pressure
on an injured or ill employee to avoid seeing a physician so that the injury or illness is not reported to FRA?


F. ``Recordable'' Rail Equipment Accident/Incident


Likewise, a ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident would encompass any event not otherwise reportable
involving the operation of on-track equipment that causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or the
track upon which such equipment was operated and that requires the removal or repair of rail equipment before any rail
operations over the track can continue. A ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident, if not tended to, would
thus disrupt railroad service.
(1) FRA does not wish to place an undue reporting burden on railroads by requiring them to maintain a log of ``fender
bender'' accidents. What term or threshold could be used to capture these accidents in a listing or log?
(2) What elements or fields should be kept in the log that would provide FRA inspectors with enough information to audit
these nonreportable accidents without placing an undue burden on the railroads?
(3) Is there a method of recording these accidents (below the reporting threshold) by means other than a standard form?
(4) Please comment on the following alternate definition for a ``recordable'' rail equipment accident: a ``recordable''
rail equipment accident/incident is any event not otherwise reportable, involving the operation of on-track equipment
that causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or to the track, roadbed, signals and/or structures
provided such equipment could be safely operated to its full range of function without repairs. (Note: Incidents
arising from broken knuckles, failed journals, and dragging equipment that does not cause damage beyond that of the
item of equipment that failed, are not required to be ``logged'' on Form FRA F 6180.xx).


G. Calculation of Damage Costs


FRA proposed that material/equipment costs could be calculated based upon the costs of acquired new material, even
if the railroad chooses to use used or refurbished materials in its actual repairs.
(1) What method(s) could be employed to accurately reflect the cost of accidents that would provide a comparable method
of comparison when using refurbished equipment?
(2) What alternative method could be employed that would accurately reflect the severity of accidents such that when
two identical derailments occur, they are reflected or rated identically even though their actual repair cost using
refurbished material are very different?


H. Seven-Day Notification (Proposed Section 225.39(a))


FRA proposed that each railroad worker must notify his or her employer, in writing, of any reportable or recordable
injury or illness within seven calendar days of incurring or obtaining knowledge of such injury or illness.
(1) Should railroads require more immediate notice?
(2) Should the railroad worker be assessed a monetary penalty for failure to report an accident or injury to his or her
employer?

<TEXT>
 

(3) Should the railroad worker's supervisor be assessed a monetary penalty for failure to report a known accident
or injury that occurred to a railroad worker?
(4) With respect to ``notifying his or her employer in writing,'' would the seven-day provision require employees
to complete the company's standard ``personal injury/illness statement'' for any alleged noise-induced hearing
loss case?
(5) Should proposed  225.39(a) contain language that would exclude the employee's ``seven-day notification
in writing requirement'' in the event of severe injury and fatality cases when it may not be possible for the employee
to comply with this provision?


I. Notification to Worker (Proposed Section 225.39(b))


FRA proposed that each railroad shall provide a copy of the proposed Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log (Form FRA
F 6180.xx) to the injured or ill worker within seven calendar days of completing the log.
(1) What steps should be taken to notify the employee that his or her case has been reported to FRA? Could this be accomplished
without placing an excessive burden on the reporting railroad?
(2) Should proposed  225.39(b) contain language that would exclude the railroad from providing a copy of the
proposed Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log to the injured or ill worker within seven calendar days of completing
the log when this may not be possible in severe injury and fatality cases?


J. Recordkeeping (Proposed Section 225.25)


1. Logs for Recording Injuries (Proposed Section 225.25(a))


FRA proposed that each railroad shall maintain the Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log (Form FRA F 6180.xx) of all
reportable and recordable injuries and illnesses to railroad workers for each railroad establishment, including,
but not limited to, an operating division, general office, and major installation such as a locomotive or car repair
or construction facility.
(a) What technique do railroads currently utilize to record injuries, even those not reportable to the FRA?
(b) Should FRA require railroads to maintain the employee's handwritten personal injury/illness statement on file?


2. Logs for Recording Accidents (Proposed Section 225.25(b))


FRA proposed that each railroad shall maintain the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log (Form FRA F 6180.xx(a))
and Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record (Form FRA F 6180.xx(b)) of reportable and recordable collisions,
derailments, fires, explosions, acts of God, or other events involving the operation of railroad on-track equipment,
signals, track, or track equipment (standing or moving) that result in damages to railroad on-track equipment, signals,
tracks, track structures, or roadbed, including labor costs and all other costs for repairs or replacement in kind
for each railroad establishment.

(a) What technique do railroads use to record accidents, even those not reportable to the FRA?



K. Data Elements


1. Ethnic and Gender Codes



FRA proposed requiring the gender and ethnicity of the injured or ill person on Form FRA F 6180.55a (Railroad Injury
and Illness (Continuation Sheet)), in an effort to help identify whether particular groups of individuals are more
susceptible than others to certain injuries and illnesses, particularly as trespassers.

(a) Are these elements (gender and ethnicity) necessary or desirable? Could an alternative be found that would serve
the same purpose, such as ``ability to read or comprehend instructions, signs, or warnings in English'' or ``ability
to interpret non-verbal instructions, signs, or warnings''?

(b) Would the collection of gender and ethnicity be acceptable when reporting trespasser injuries and fatalities?



2. Cause Codes for Injuries



(a) What additional codes could be used in the ``Cause Code'' block on the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55a? Is this block
necessary or desirable? Why or why not?



3. Special Study Blocks (SSB)



FRA proposes to establish three SSB's on Form FRA F 6180.54 (Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report) for the purpose
of temporarily collecting information on these issues of immediate safety concern. When one or more critical safety
issues arise, FRA would notify the railroad reporting officers and request that they, for a specified time-frame,
collect and report on the critical issues using the SSB. Upon expiration of the pre-defined time period, the SSB would
not be used again until the next issues of immediate concern.

(a) Are the SSB's necessary or desirable?

(b) What limitations should be placed on the SSB usage?



4. SSB for Form FRA F 6180.57 (Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Form



(a) Should FRA add a similar special study block (SSB) to Form FRA F 6180.57 to capture data on unusual or special situations?
How could it be utilized?



5. Motorist Impairment



In order to collect more information on motorists involved in highway-rail grade crossing accidents, FRA proposed
to amend Form FRA F 6180.57 (Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report) to require information under
the heading ``Motorist,'' if known, on the motorist's age and gender, and whether the motorist was impaired by alcohol
or drugs at the time of the accident/incident.

(a) How readily available is this information?

(b) How many times has a railroad been denied access to a police report? Please cite specific instances.

(c) Does the claim department investigate every grade crossing accident?

(d) Is there another source for this information? FHWA or NHTSA? Could the two data bases be linked?



6. Signal Failure and Whistle Bans



FRA proposes to add two new questions to the Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report (Form FRA F 6180.57)
to gather information on whistle bans and signal system failures. New block ``34'' asks whether a whistle ban was in
effect and observed at the time of the accident/incident. New block ``35'' asks whether there was a signal system failure
within the last seven calendar days up to and including the day of the accident. The codes for completing both items
would be included in the FRA Guide.

(a) Are the proposed blocks for ``Signal Failure'' and ``Whistle Ban'' necessary? Why or why not?

(b) Should Form FRA F 6180.57 also collect responses for situations where the motorist is ``trapped by other motor
vehicle traffic'' at the time of the highway-rail grade crossing accident?



7. Specific Location of the Accident



(a) Would a requirement for additional accident location information (based on the host railroad's timetable, the
division, sub-division, specific track segment name or timetable designation, and milepost number where the accident/incident
occurred) provide sufficient information to pinpoint the accident site?

(b) Would a requirement for the specific latitude and longitude of the accident site be beneficial? Why or why not?

(c) Which of the above would prove least burdensome to the railroad industry?



L. Access to Records (Proposed Section 225.41)



FRA proposed in  225.41 that all reports, logs, plans, and records (including relevant claims and medical records)
provided for in part 225 shall, upon request, be made available to any representative of the Federal Railroad Administration
or of a State agency participating in investigative and surveillance activities under part 212 of this chapter, for
examination and photocopying in a reasonable manner during normal business hours at a central location(s) identified
pursuant to proposed  225.27(c).

(1) What part(s) of a worker's medical records should be exempt from disclosure to the FRA inspector?

(2) Does your railroad have a centralized claims department or individual claims offices scattered throughout the
system?

(3) Does your main claims office have all information that the individual claim representative has, or is the entire
file forwarded only when closed?

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Roof Crush Resistance


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Ford Motor Company (Ford) and the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA) have each submitted petitions
asking NHTSA to clarify some provisions in the roof crush resistance standard. Specifically, both these petitioners
suggested changes to the current specifications for placing the load plate on vehicles during compliance testing,
particularly vehicles with sloped aerodynamic roofs or raised roofs. NHTSA has granted both of these petitions.


This notice asks the public for its views and comments on what changes, if any, are needed to the roof crush resistance
standard. NHTSA will consider all such comments together with the petitions in deciding what regulatory changes,
if any, may be appropriate for the roof crush resistance standard.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Standard No. 216 (49 CFR 571.216) sets forth roof crush resistance requirements that must be met by passenger cars,
trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 6000 pounds or less. The purpose of the standard,
as stated in S2 of the standard, is ``to reduce deaths and injuries due to the crushing of the roof into the passenger
compartment in rollover accidents.''

Standard No. 216 seeks to achieve this purpose by requiring vehicles to be certified as complying with a performance
test in which a load of 11/2 times the unloaded vehicle weight (up to a maximum of 5000 pounds for passenger cars) is applied
to the vehicle roof by means of a rigid unyielding block whose lower surface consists of a flat rectangle 30 inches wide
and 72 inches long. 

During the test, the plate is required to be positioned so that:

(1) When viewed from the side of the test vehicle, the test plate is angled 5
  toward the front of the vehicle;

(2) When viewed from the front of the test vehicle, the test plate is angled 25
  below the horizontal on the side of the vehicle to which the test plate is applied; and

(3) The initial contact point of the test plate with the test vehicle roof is 10 inches from the forwardmost point of
the test plate. 

The test plate orientation and placement are illustrated in Figure 1 of Standard No. 216. 

These requirements were initially proposed in a notice published on January 6, 1971 (36 FR 3) and are patterned after
the specifications in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Standard J374. At that time, most vehicle roofs were
less rounded than today's designs, and there were no raised-roof vehicles to be tested. Thus, the specifications
for positioning the test plate ensured that it would be positioned to measure the roof's strength in the A-pillar region
and to ensure that the strength was sufficient to prevent sudden collapse of the roof above the A-pillars and front
seating areas during rollovers. 



Petitions



A. RVIA



RVIA recently submitted a petition asking that vans, motor homes and other multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks,
and buses that have raised roofs and that are now subject to Standard No. 216 be tested according to the requirements
of Standard No. 220, 

School Bus Rollover Protection. 

Standard No. 220 subjects vehicles to the same force on the roof as does Standard No. 216 (11/2 times the unloaded vehicle
weight), but the force is applied differently. The test plate used in Standard No. 220 is larger than the 30 x 72
inch plate used in Standard No. 216. In addition, instead of concentrating the load in the vicinity of the A-pillars
the test load is evenly distributed over the entire roof in Standard No. 220.

RVIA used the following arguments to support its petition:



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) There are several van conversions currently produced with raised roofs that are subject to Standard No. 216. Such
vehicles include conversions of the Plymouth Voyager, Doge Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country, Chevrolet Astro,
and GMC Safari minivans. Because of the raised roof configuration, the load plate for the test cannot be placed according
to the specified procedure in the standard.

(2) Since the original vehicles, prior to conversion that raises the roof, have been certified as complying with Standard
No. 216, the A-pillar strength will have already been demonstrated. Testing to Standard No. 220 after raising the
roof would then test the strength of the entire roof structure.



B. Ford



Ford recently submitted a petition focused on what it believes is an anomaly with the current positioning procedures
for the test plate in Standard No. 216. Ford indicated that several of its models with aerodynamic roof designs have
roof slopes greater than 5
  at the forward edge of the roof. The test plate is required to be angled 5
  of the forward edge of the roof. The effect of the slope on these aerodynamic roof designs is that the initial point
of contact between the roof and the test plate is moved several inches behind the A-pillar when the test plate is positioned
according to the current placement procedure. Ford believes this rearward movement of the initial contact point
is contrary to the agency's intent when it initially promulgated the standard.

Ford argued that additional support for this argument can be found in S6.2 of Standard No. 216, which specifies the
test plate should be applied by ``(o)rient(ing) the test device as shown in Figure 1 * * *'' Figure 1
clearly shows the test plate is applied at the front corner of the roof. Thus, for vehicles with sloped, aerodynamic
roofs, there is a conflict between Figure 1, which positions the test plate forward of the leading edge of the roof,
and S6.2(d), which specifies that the test plate should be positioned with reference to the initial point of contact,
even if that point is rearward of the leading edge of the roof. Ford acknowledged that NHTSA has addressed this conflict
in an October 3, 1980 interpretation, in which the agency said that the language of S6.2(d) should be used to position
the test plate, even if that means the test plate will not be forward of the A-pillar or the roof's leading edge. Ford
indicated that it has followed this interpretation, but it does not believe that such an interpretation results in
improved roof crush performance when vehicles are in use on the public roads.

Ford asked in its petition that S6.2(d) of Standard No. 216 be amended to specify that the leading edge of the test plate
should always be placed over the leading edge of the vehicle roof. Ford proposed the following language:




The initial contact point, or center of the initial contact area, is on the longitudinal centerline of the device.
A plane perpendicular to the lower surface of the test device and 25 mm rearward of the front edge of the lower surface
passes through the rearmost point of the opening in the body structure for the windshield.



Agency Response to the Petitions



NHTSA believes that both of these petitions raise issues that should be examined further. RVIA believes the requirement
to move the test plate rearward of the A-pillar on conversion vans with raised roofs imposes needless and significant
burdens on second-stage manufacturers. Ford believes the requirement to move the test plate rearward of the A-pillar
on vehicles with aerodynamic roofs is contrary to the agency's original intent and results in a less stringent test
of the A-pillars' strength. both of these are relevant issues. Accordingly, the agency has granted both the RVIA and
Ford petitions. NHTSA is now conducting a research program to investigate the test methods described in these petitions
and to see if the current test procedures are suitable for vehicles with raised or contour roofs, or if some changed
test procedures are needed.

<PARENT> FR941227-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


The fact that the agency has granted these petitions does not mean that the requirements of the standard will necessarily
be modified. NHTSA has undertaken to investigate this issue more carefully and, after the conclusion of this investigation,
will decide whether it should propose any modifications to the test procedure. In the meantime, manufacturers must
continue to certify their vehicles for compliance according to the existing requirements of Standard No. 216 unless
and until some modified requirements are in place.


Further, the fact that the agency has granted these petitions does not mean that NHTSA agrees with all that is said in
these petitions. For instance, the RVIA petition asks that Standard No. 220 test for roof crush resistance be substituted
for the current Standard No. 216 test for roof crush resistance. NHTSA is concerned that such a substitution could
result in a less stringent test over the front seating positions, or may not be appropriate to evaluate the strength
of the pillars for crush resistance. Standard No. 220 was developed for school buses and it assesses the roof crush
protection afforded for the entire seating area. It does this by using a test procedure that loads the entire roof structure,
including A-, B-, and any other pillars in the vehicle.


By way of contrast, Standard No. 216 is applicable to smaller vehicles. Front seat occupants experience the vast majority
of deaths and injuries in these vehicles. To address this, a test procedure was developed to assess the roof crush protection
afforded to front seat occupants. The test procedure concentrates the load in the vicinity of one of the A-pillars
to simulate the most severe impact condition that a pillar would experience in a rollover crash.


It appears, then, that substituting the Standard No. 220 test for raised roof vehicles instead of the Standard No.
216 test, would trade off increased roof crush protection for rear seat occupants in those vehicles, with diminished
protection for front seat occupants. However, there is no supporting information in the RIVA petition that quantifies
either how much protection front seat occupants might lose or how much protection rear seat occupants might gain from
this substitution. The agency will examine this carefully in its research before deciding whether to consider any
change to the current test requirements.


In addition, RVIA suggested that the strength of the A-pillars in the vehicle that is converted by its members would
be demonstrated by the original vehicle manufacturer's certification for the vehicle that complied with Standard
No. 216. The agency is not convinced at this point that this conclusion is valid because the agency has no data to prove
or disprove that the roof strength in the area of the A-pillars is affected by raised roof conversions. RVIA provided
no such data in its petition in support of their claim.


In its petition, Ford did provide some test data, although they were very limited. Ford provided roof crush test results
for two prototypes of a new vehicle design. In one, the test plate was positioned according to the current Standard
No. 216 procedures. In the second, the front edge of the test plate was positioned 100 mm behind the front corner of the
roof (closer to the A-pillar structure). The test results from the latter procedure produced a peak force that was
49 percent higher than the peak force produced using the current positioning procedure, within 5 inches of crush.
When following Standard No. 216 test procedures, the test plate was positioned 150 mm behind the windshield opening,
completely missing the A-pillar and leading edge of the roof.

Ford's petition indicates that its proposed change to the language of S6.2(d) would consistently locate the test
place one inch forward of the rearmost edge of the front windshield opening, thereby reducing test variability and
ensuring that the test plate is positioned ahead of the roof's leading edge. NHTSA notes that while this would position
the test plate over the leading edge of the roof, it would not necessarily load the roof at the rearmost windshield opening.
Ford's proposed change retained the same test plate angles currently specified in Standard No. 216, which means the
initial contact point for the test plate on the roof would be the same as at present. In other words, it appears to NHTSA
that Ford's proposal would ensure the consistent orientation of the test plate over the front of the roof, but would
not ensure that area of the roof would be tested. Further, the agency is uncertain whether the proposed test plate positioning
one inch forward of the rearmost edge of the front windshield opening would be an improved test for all vehicles with
uncommon roof shapes or whether it would reduce the stringency of the current test procedure.



Areas in Which the Public's Ideas and Information Are Requested



The agency is interested in comments on the changes requested in both the Ford and RVIA petitions. Therefore, the agency
is seeking from all interested parties comments on the two proposals along with any available test data to substantiate
or refute those proposals. The agency is also interested in other ways to accommodate aerodynamically sloped and
raised roof vehicles. For instance, should the angles at which the test plate is applied and/or the size and shape of
the test plate itself be changed? If the plate size were reduced or if the plate shape were changed to circular, the test
plate could be placed over the A-pillar region on raised roof vehicles.

Standard No. 216 currently provides that the test plate shall be angled 5
  toward the front of the vehicle, when viewed from the side of the test vehicle. This angle could be changed sufficiently
to ensure the test plate would contact the A-pillar region, with the new angle based on an analysis of real world crashes
and roof geometries.

The agency is also interested in any other approaches the public might wish to suggest in this area. As always, the most
helpful comments will be those that set forth data to substantiate the position taken in the comment. NHTSA would like
to alert commenters that the agency will not propose any changes to Standard No. 216 test procedures until the agency
is satisfied that data and analysis show the changes will not reduce real world safety protection for vehicle occupants.



Submission of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit comments in response to this request for comments. It is requested but not
required that 10 copies be submitted.

All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions
without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to state their positions
and arguments concisely.

If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the NHTSA Chief Counsel,
Room 5219, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington DC 20590, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential
information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section at the street address given above. A request
for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's
confidential business information regulation (49 CFR part 512).

Comments on this notice will be available for inspection in the docket. NHTSA will continue to file relevant information
as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date. Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of
their written comments in the Docket Section should enclose, in the envelope with their comments, a self-addressed
stamped postcard. Upon receipt, the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 12-Month Finding for a Petition to List As Endangered or Threatened
the Contiguous United States Population of the Canada Lynx



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of 12-month petition finding.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 12-month finding for a petition to add the contiguous United
States population of the Canada lynx (

Lynx canadensis

) to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species. The Service finds the petitioned action of listing the Canada lynx
in the 48 contiguous States is not warranted.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Section4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires that, for any petition to revise the List of Threatened and Endangered Species that contains substantial
scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted, a finding must be made
within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (i) not warranted, (ii) warranted,
or (iii) warranted but precluded by the efforts to revise the list and expeditious progress is being made in listing
and delisting species. Upon making the finding, a notice shall be promptly published in the 

Federal Register

. With this notice, the Service announces its 12-month finding on the petition to list the Canada lynx is not warranted.
This finding is based on various documents, including published and unpublished studies, agency files, field survey
records, and consultations with other Federal and State agencies. This notice summarizes information contained
in the 12-month finding and represents the conclusion of the Service's status review.

In August 1991, the U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition from several conservation organizations
requesting that the Service list the lynx of the North Cascades ecosystem as an endangered species and designate critical
habitat.

On October 6, 1992, the Service published a notice of a petition finding indicating that there was not substantial
information to indicate that listing the North Cascades population of the Canada lynx as endangered may be warranted
(57 FR 46007). On July 9, 1993, the Service published a notice of a second finding on the North Cascades petition after
evaluating new information and again found that there was not substantial information to indicate that listing the
population may be warranted (58 FR 36924). 

Following publication of the notice, the petitioners filed suit challenging the finding. A settlement agreement
was reached on November 30, 1993, where the Service agreed to conduct a full status review of the lynx throughout its
range in the lower 48 States and to determine whether it qualified as endangered or threatened pursuant to 16 U.S.C.
Part 1533(a). On February 2, 1994, the Service published a notice (59 FR 4887) announcing continuation of a status
review initiated in 1982. The Service reviewed and considered public comments during its evaluation of the status
of the lynx in the contiguous U.S.

A petition dated April 23, 1994, was received by the Service from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation on April 27, 1994.
The petition requested that the conterminous U.S. population of the North American lynx (

Felis lynx canadensis

) be listed as a threatened or endangered species. The petition provided numerous reasons for why the Canada lynx population
in the contiguous U.S. should be added to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species. The petitioners also requested
that the southern Rocky Mountain population of the lynx be protected by emergency listing because it is severely imperiled,
the population level is low, and it is reproductively isolated. 

Notice of a 90-day finding published in the August 26, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 44123) found that there was substantial information to indicate that listing the contiguous population of
the Canada lynx may be warranted. However, the notice also indicated that the petition did not present substantial
information to indicate the emergency listing of the Canada lynx in the southern Rockies is warranted. 

The lynx, generally considered rare because of its secretive nature, is actually common throughout its Northern
American range. Lynx occupy the boreal regions of North America, commonly referred to as the Canadian and Hudsonian
Life Zones. These habitats are characterized by dense coniferous forests and wet bogs. Cold climates, deep snow,
and wildfire are major influences on these habitats. Lynx are found within these habitats from Newfoundland, Labrador,
and Quebec on the east to Alaska and British Columbia on the west; from the Arctic treeline south into portions of the
contiguous U.S. (Brittell et al. 1989). 

Specific to the U.S., lynx distribution represents the fringe of the population occurring in its historic range.
Consequently, the lynx does not commonly occur within this southern limit of its range due to the lack of favorable
habitats. Favorable habitat conditions for the lynx dissipate with decreasing latitude. Thus, the lynx is restricted
to higher elevations the more southern the latitude. The most southern range extensions for the species are found
in the Rocky Mountains and associated high elevations. The distribution and population numbers of the lynx closely
follow that of the snowshoe hare, its primary food item. During population highs, snowshoe hare may occupy marginal
habitats thereby, allowing the lynx to widen their distribution (Brittell et al. 1989). During years of abundance,
lynx may extend their distribution and occur in higher densities along the southern extension of their range. This
fluctuation of population size and distribution is attributed to dispersal of predominately young animals from
the resident Canadian population. Local ``irruptions'' or invasions of lynx have been reported in the northern U.S.
following population highs further north in Canada. Population cycles may not be as noticeable in the southern extremes
of the lynx range because such habitat is not an important part of its range and U.S. resident populations are initially
low.
The historic range of the lynx in the contiguous U.S. has generally been recognized as including New England (Maine,
New Hampshire, Vermont and New York), the Great Lakes (Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota), the Rocky Mountains (Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado) and the Northwest Region (Washington and Oregon). There is evidence that presence
of lynx in the contiguous U.S. corresponded to cyclic dispersals from Canada (particularly in the Great Lakes region).
Thus, the Service believes that some of these States within the species' historic range never supported viable resident
populations of lynx over time.
The Northeastern and Great Lakes forests are sub-boreal forests and therefore fire regimes, important for the creation
of snowshoe hare habitat, do not function as in true boreal forests. Most of these original sub-boreal forests were
destroyed by lumbering and agricultural activities by the late 1880's and early 1900's. The lynx was already extirpated
from the New England States (except for Maine) by the turn of the century.
Lynx were extremely scarce in the first half of the century in Montana. By 1979, the population was estimated to be between
1800 and 2500 animals. Lumbering activities and wildfire of the early 1920's, has affected Montana's present population
of lynx which is the largest in the contiguous U.S. Montana also has the largest amount of available habitat (Giddings
1994). In the Cascades (Northwest Region), lynx benefit from relative isolation of large undisturbed tracts of habitat
(approximately 3,673 square miles) and in the State of Washington, there is about 6,500 square miles of lynx habitat
(Brittell et al. 1989).
The Canada lynx (

Lynx canadensis

) is one and the same species (a monotypic species) throughout its entire range in North America. The term ``species''
under the Act includes any subspecies of fish, wildlife, and plants, and any distinct population segment of any species
of vertebrate fish and wildlife which interbreeds when mature. The Service limited it status review of the lynx to
the 48 contiguous States, as directed in the settlement agreement and requested in the petition.


Summary of Factors Affecting the Species


The following is a summary and discussion of the five factors set forth in section 4(a)(1) of the Act and their applicability
to the current status of the Canada lynx in the contiguous 48 States.


A. Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range

The Canada lynx is widely distributed throughout the northern boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. Its extreme southern
limits are the U.S./Canada border areas with the southern-most extensions found in the Rocky Mountains. Historically,
lynx populations were minimal in the contiguous U.S. due to a lack of suitable habitat. During years of lynx abundance
in Canada increased densities of resident populations resulted along the southern boundary of its range. There is
evidence that the increased presence of lynx in the contiguous U.S. corresponds to cyclic dispersals from Canada.
At the turn of the century and especially in the Northeastern portion of the U.S., habitat loss due to human settlement
and forest clearing reduced the southern range of the lynx. Since the 1970's, this trend has reversed in some States.
Presently, Maine, Montana and Washington have resident lynx populations. In Montana prior to 1950, lynx were considered
to be extremely rare. Today, however, an estimated 700 to 1,050 lynx could occupy approximately 37,000 square miles
of montane forest habitat in Montana (Giddings 1994).



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



In the contiguous U.S., lynx inhabit fairly remote, isolated areas. Before 1977, pelt prices were low, approximately
$12.00 a piece and lynx were harvested incidental to other furbearers. In 1977, all felids, including lynx, were listed
in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Appendix
II species may be internationally traded provided CITES export permits are issued. The issuance of permits provides
a means of monitoring trade and determining if it is having a significant impact on the species. In conjunction with
CITES, States are required to have a management program and a harvest season for the species. Presently only five States
have a trapping season for lynx_Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, and Washington. In 1984, Minnesota closed its
lynx season and Washington followed suit in 1990. Presently only Idaho and Montana of the lower 48 States allow a limited
annual harvest of two and three animals, respectively. These quotas include the incidental take of lynx by bobcat
trappers. From 1982 to 1992, only three lynx were trapped in Idaho. From 1993 to 1994, only four animals were taken in
Montana. These low harvest levels are contributed to the low level of hunting and trapping occurring in the remote
areas inhabited by lynx. Hunting and trapping pressure on the lynx has been historically low in the U.S. and there is
little evidence that these activities pose a threat to the continued existence of this species in the wild.



C. Disease or Predation



The Canada lynx could be displaced or eliminated by expansion of competitors such as the bobcat (

Lynx rufus

) or coyote (

Canis latrans

) into their present range. However, lynx are more restricted to areas that receive deep snow cover where they are more
highly adapted than are bobcats. Neither disease nor predation is known to be a threat to the lynx.



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanism



The lynx is protected in each State where it occurs in the lower 48 contiguous States. Seven States classify it as threatened
or endangered or a species of concern. Idaho and Montana have a trapping season with annual Statewide harvest quotas
of two and three animals, respectively. Hunting and trapping with dogs and taking with firearms is illegal in every
State except one in which the lynx occurs. Few if any States ever had a bounty system for the species. In addition to State
protection, the lynx has been listed in Appendix II of CITES since 1977, and its status and harvest levels have been
monitored by the Service's Office of Scientific Authority.



E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence



Lynx distribution has not significantly changed from historic ranges except for periodic peripheral shifts of distribution
with cyclical changes of its chief prey, the snowshoe or varying hare (

Lepus americanus

), and local losses due to loss of habitat in southern-most areas. Fire suppression in the contiguous 48 States has
had some effect on lynx numbers, since early successional habitats are important to lynx due to a greater abundance
of snowshoe hares in these areas. Although early regeneration stages of habitat are preferred by hares, lynx hunt
primarily in more open mature and later successional stages of forest.



Finding



The Act requires the Service to make determinations regarding listings solely on the basis of the best available scientific
and commercial data after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those efforts
being made by State and Federal agencies to protect the species. The Act also allows for the Service to list ``distinct
population segments'' of vertebrate fish and wildlife.

The Service was petitioned to list the Canada lynx in the 40 contiguous States as a vertebrate population pursuant
to the Endangered Species Act. The Service conducted a status review of the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S. After
carefully evaluating the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the past, present and
future threats faced by this species, the Service finds that listing of the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S. is not
warranted. The Service also finds that the petition did not present substantial information that the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the Canada lynx meets the definition of a ``species'' under section 3(15) of the Act.

The Canada lynx is naturally low density-occurring carnivore throughout the northern boreal forests of Canada and
Alaska with its extreme southern limits occurring south of the U.S./Canada border. It was never a common species in
the contiguous U.S. because of limited suitable habitat and, except for in Maine, Montana and Washington, little
evidence of breeding populations south of the border exists. Presence of the species in most of the contiguous 48 States
corresponds to cyclic dispersals from Canada.
At the turn of the century, habitat loss due to human settlement and forest clearing reduced the range of lynx in southern
areas. However, the lynx currently occupies much of its original historic range. The Service is unable to substantiate
that trapping, hunting, poaching, and present habitat destruction threaten the continued existence of the lynx
in the wild in the contiguous U.S. Consequently, the Service finds that listing the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S.
is not warranted. The Service's 12-month finding contains more detailed information regarding the above decisions.
A copy may be obtained from the Division of Endangered Species (see

<DOCTITLE>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Reopening of Comment Period on Data Pertaining to the Subspecies
Taxonomy of the California Gnatcatcher</DOCTITLE>

ACTION: 

Notice of reopening of public comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice that the comment period on the data pertaining to the subspecies
taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher is reopened through January 26, 1995. The Service has reopened the comment
period to ensure that the public may review and comment on significant comments and analyses received during the original
public comment period, which was open from June 2, to December 1, 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On March 30, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule in the 

Federal Register 

determining the coastal California gnatcatcher to be a threatened species (58 FR 16741). In its decision to the list
the gnatcatcher, the Service relied, in part, on taxonomic studies conducted by Dr. Jonathan Atwood of the Manomet
Bird Observatory, Manomet, Massachusetts. As is the standard practice in the scientific community, the Service
did not request, nor was it offered, the data collected and used by Dr. Atwood in reaching his conclusions. Instead,
the Service depended upon the conclusions published by Dr. Atwood in a peer-reviewed scientific article on the subspecific
taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher (Atwood 1991).
In response to a suit filed by the Endangered Species Committee of the Building Industry Association of Southern California
and other plaintiffs, the United States District Court of the District of Columbia vacated the listing of the coastal
California gnatcatcher because the Service did not make available Atwood's data for public review and comment. In
response to the court decision, Dr. Atwood released his data to the Service, which the agency made available to the
public for review and comment on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28508). On June 16, 1994, the court reinstated threatened status
for the coastal California gnatcatcher until the Secretary of the Interior determines in a finding whether the listing
should be revised or revoked in light of his review of the subject data and public comments received during the comment
period. As a result of the court orders of July 27, 1994, and September 30, 1994, the Service extended the comment period
to December 1, 1994, (59 FR 38426, 59 FR 44125, and 59 FR 53628).

The Service received 11 substantive comments in response to the request for public comments on Dr. Atwood's data and
analysis. Of particular note, Dr. William Link mathematician, and Grey Pendleton, biometrician, with the National
Biological Survey (NBS) conducted new analyses of these data and presented it in a report (Link and Pendleton 1994).
Their four conclusions were:
(1) That the morphological characters in Atwood's data set vary along the geographical gradient, 
(2) That the changes in characters are more reasonably represented by discrete groupings than by a gradual pattern
of change, and are thus consistent with the existence of subgroups within the population, 
(3) That there is at least 1 break north of site 5 (Atwood's BG27) [approximately 30
  N latitude], and
(4) That there is at least 1 break south of site 5.
Moreover, the Service received two additional statistical analyses (Dr. Atwood; and Dr. Karen Messer, Department
of Mathematics, California State University, Fullerton) that supported a southern terminus of 30
  N latitude for the coastal California gnatcatcher. However, the Service received three significant comments
that, for various reasons, did not support such a southern terminus (Dr. George Barrowclough, ornithologist from
New York; Dr. Lyman McDonald, consultant from Wyoming; and Dr. James MacMahon and other colleagues, College of Science,
Utah State University).
In light of the NBS report (Link and Pendleton 1994), the Service reopens the comment period to ensure that the public
may review and comment on this and other significant comments and analyses received during the original public comment
period. The comment period is opened through January 26, 1995.

Export of American Alligators Taken in 1995 Through 1997



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed findings and proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates international
trade in certain animal and plant species. As a general rule, exports of animals and plants listed on Appendix II of
CITES may occur only if a Scientific Authority has advised a permit-issuing Management Authority that such exports
will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the animals
or plants were not obtained in violation of laws for their protection. Based on documentation presented for consideration
by the CITES Parties in 1983, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has determined that the American alligator
is listed on Appendix II for reasons of similarity in appearance under Article II.2(b) of CITES as well as the potential
threat to the species survival under CITES Article II.2(a).



This notice announces proposed findings by the U.S. Scientific Authority and Management Authority on the export
of alligators harvested during the 1995-1997 taking seasons from certain States previously approved for such
export for the 1992-1994 harvest seasons and for the State of Arkansas which was previously approved for the
1994 harvest season. These proposed findings also stipulate that monitoring procedures previously established
for this species be continued.

In addition, references in the regulation concerning the manner in which tags are to be attached to American alligator
hides at the time of export and the conditions for export of parts and products are being clarified.

The Service requests comments on these proposed findings and information on the species involved.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Since 1977, the Service has employed the rulemaking process to develop and issue decisions on the export of certain
species under CITES. The reason for this approach is that it is more effective to issue general decisions on the export
of all specimens of a species harvested in a given State and season than to issue such decisions separately for each
permit application. This is especially true for CITES Appendix II species that are frequently exported, such as the
American alligator. On May 26, 1992 (57 FR 21896), the Service published rules granting export approval for American
alligators (

Alligator mississippiensis

) from specified States for the 1992-1994 harvest seasons. Subsequently, based on advice from the Office of
Scientific Authority and the Office of Management Authority, the Service also approved the export of farm-raised
American alligators from the State of Arkansas for the 1994 harvest season. The purpose of this current proposal is
to develop a rule that will allow the export of legally taken American alligators (hides, meat, parts, and products)
for the 1995-1997 harvest years from previously approved States. 



Scientific Authority Findings 



Article II, paragraph 2, of CITES establishes that Appendix II shall include: 






(a) All species which although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens
of such species is subject to strict regulations in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival;
and 



(b) Other species which must be subject to regulation in order that trade in specimens of certain species referred
to in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph may be brought under effective control.

 


The American alligator is listed in Appendix II to respond both to problems of potential threat to the survival of the
species [CITES Article II.2(a)] and of the similarity of appearance to other crocodilians that are threatened with
possible extinction [CITES Article II.2(b)]. Article IV of CITES requires that an export permit for any specimen
of a species included in Appendix II shall only be granted when certain findings have been made by the Scientific Authority
and Management Authority of the exporting country. The marking of hides with specified tags, the marking and documentation
of shipments of meat and parts, and the issuance of export permits specifically for American alligator parts and products
is considered sufficient to address the issue of identification due to similarity in appearance between American
alligators and other listed crocodilian species. Because the alligator is listed partly due to the potential threat
to its survival based on previous population declines that have been reversed in most parts of its range in the United
States, the Service must determine that allowing exports and thereby stimulating harvest will not be detrimental
to the survival of the species itself. 

The U.S. Scientific Authority must develop advice on nondetriment for the export of Appendix II species in accordance
with Section 8A of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. The Act states that the Secretary of the Interior,
``shall base such determinations and advice given by him under Article IV of the CITES with respect to wildlife upon
the best available biological information derived from professionally accepted wildlife management practices;
but is not required to make, or require any State to make, estimates of population size in making such determinations
or giving such advice.'' 

Guidelines developed for Scientific Authority advice on exports of American alligator under provisions of CITES
Article II.2(a), are summarized as follows: 



A. Minimum Requirements for Biological Information



(1) The condition of the population, including trends (the method of determination to be a matter of State choice)
and population estimates where such information is available; 

(2) Total harvest of the species for each harvest season; 

(3) Distribution of harvest; and 

(4) Habitat evaluation.

<DOCNO> FR941227-1-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

B. Minimum Requirements for a Management Program 



(1) There should be a controlled harvest with the methods and seasons determined by the State; 

(2) All hides, meat, and parts should be registered and marked; and 

(3) Harvest level objectives should be determined annually by the State. 

In applying these guidelines, the Service considers the following types of information on the conditions of the population:
(a) A current estimate [if such information is available] of the total number of animals in the pre-harvest population
derived by appropriate scientific censusing methodology; (b) a description of ongoing research being conducted
to assess the distribution, abundance, or general condition of the species in the State with a summarization of results
obtained, including results of any analysis of age structure or reproductive parameters; and (c) an assessment of
long-term population trends of the species in the State and the relationship of these trends to habitat conditions,
management practices, harvest pressure, and/or other factors. 

Information on anticipated harvest to be considered by the Service includes: (a) The number of animals to be harvested
[by county or game management unit, if data are available at these local levels]; (b) the number of alligator hunters
expected to be licensed; and (c) the time of the harvest season. 

In the case of the alligator, as with most other wild animals, the resource is monitored by a variety of techniques that
yield information used in evaluating the condition of a population. As these data are accumulated over time, they
reflect trends and call attention to changes in the populations. Habitat information, indices of population size,
age and sex structure, and harvest information are all used to evaluate population status. Although the Endangered
Species Act Amendments of 1982 provided that population estimates are not to be required for the approval of export
of Appendix II wildlife, if such estimates are provided by the States or are otherwise available, they will be considered
together with information of the types listed above in making findings on nondetriment. 

In addition to considering the effect of trade on species or populations native to the United States that are being
exported, the Scientific Authority will also monitor the status of the American alligator to: (a) Determine whether
treatment of the American alligator remains appropriate; and (b) detect any significant downward trends in the populations
and, where necessary, advise on more restrictive export controls in response to these trends. This monitoring and
assessment will follow the same procedures adopted for other CITES-listed species (see 49 FR 590, January 5, 1984).
The Service will review information on population status and harvest data relevant to the no detriment finding process
from each export-approved State, as appropriate. When indicated by available information and a thorough review
of accumulated data, a determination can then be made about the treatment of this species and whether the management
program needs to be adjusted in a particular State. 

The status of the American alligator has dramatically improved throughout its range since the species was placed
under State and Federal control. One of the primary reasons for this improvement has been the effective management
programs administered by State wildlife agencies. The Service expects these management programs to continue to
be effective in conserving the American alligator in the future. 

The export of American alligators taken in the 1992 through 1994 harvest seasons in certain States was previously
approved by the Service (57 FR 21896). In that rule, the Service found that current information on the population status,
management, and harvest available from the States included in the rule, along with other information collected by
the Service, supported a finding that the export of American alligators taken in accordance with State regulations
in those States and in those harvest seasons would not be detrimental to the survival of the species in those States
approved for export. The Service's previous assessment of the status of the alligator under the Endangered Species
Act was sufficient to support reclassification of the species throughout its range from threatened to threatened
for similarity of appearance. This reclassification was accomplished in different parts of its range as the biological
status of the alligator improved. The following rulemaking documents provide the rationale for the removal of threatened
and endangered listings: 40 FR 44412, September 26, 1975; 42 FR 2071, January 10, 1977; 44 FR 37130, June 25, 1979; 46
FR 40664, August 10, 1981; 48 FR 46332, October 12, 1983; 50 FR 25672, June 20, 1985; and 51 FR 19760, June 2, 1986.

Based upon information available from the previously approved States and in consideration of the tagging requirements
stipulated by the Management Authority, the Service proposes to issue Scientific Authority advice in favor of export
of alligator hides and parts legally harvested in those States during the 1995-97 harvest seasons. 



Management Authority Findings 



Exports of Appendix II species are to be allowed under CITES only if the Scientific Authority advises that the exports
will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimens
were not obtained in contravention of laws enacted for their protection. The Service, therefore, must be satisfied
that the American alligator hides, meat, or products being exported were not obtained in violation of State or Federal
laws for their protection. For the American alligator, evidence of legal take is provided by Service-approved State
export tagging and container marking programs. 

To assist these State export tagging programs, the Service annually 
contracts for the manufacture and delivery of special CITES animal-hide tags for Service-approved, export-qualified
States. 

In a 

Federal Register

 notice, published on April 24, 1986 (51 FR 15548), the Service announced the introduction, use, and protection of
a US-CITES tag symbol. This symbol appears on every Service-approved export tag to provide legal evidence of U.S.
export approval for certain species listed on Appendix II of CITES. Hides marked with tags that lack this US-CITES
symbol are not legally exportable from the United States. 

Guidelines developed for Management Authority findings on State-managed American alligator export programs,
under provisions of CITES Article IV.2(a), are summarized as follows: 

(1) Current State alligator trapping, hide tagging, meat and parts processing, marking, and shipping regulations
must be on file with the Office of Management Authority; 

(2) Sample reporting forms, export tag, meat and parts packing seal, parts tag, and specifications of the State's
standard meat and parts package/container must be on file with the Office of Management Authority; 

(3) The hide export tag must be durable and permanently locking, and must show the US-CITES logo, State of origin, year
of take, species, and a unique serial number; 

(4) The export tag, meat seal, and parts tag or seal must be applied to all hides, meat, or parts within a minimum time
after take or processing as specified by State law and such time should be as short as possible to minimize movement
of untagged hides, meat, or parts; 

(5) US-CITES tags must be inserted through the hide and permanently locked in place using the locking mechanism of
the tag and in accordance with State requirements; other tags or seals must be permanently attached as mandated by
the State; 

(6) All American alligator harvesters and processors must be State registered; 

(7) All American alligator hide, meat, and parts dealers must be State registered; 

(8) All State-registered American alligator harvesters, processors, and dealers must make available their American
alligator harvest and commerce data to the State on at least an annual basis, as specified by the State; 

(9) State-registered American alligator dealers and State licensed harvesters authorized to attach export tags
must account for tags received and must return unused tags to the State within a time specified by the State after the
taking season closes; and 

(10) When manufactured hide products are to be exported from the United States, the CITES export tags that were removed
from the hides contained in the products must be surrendered to the Service prior to export.

Based upon: (1) The finding of nondetriment by the Scientific Authority, and (2) information available from the previously
export-approved States, the Service proposes to issue Management Authority approval for the export of American
alligators legally harvested during 1995-1997 from those States previously approved for such export, including
Arkansas. 



Multiyear Findings 



The Service has monitored existing State programs for the American alligator in most of the previously approved States
for many years and expects these States will continue to satisfy CITES requirements. States seeking for the first
time to establish a harvest program for alligators should apply for CITES export approval no later than January 2 of
the year before they plan to initiate such a program. To ensure that export-approved States maintain successful programs
and that export is not detrimental to the survival of the species, the Service plans to continue annual monitoring
of State management and export marking programs through evaluation of State annual reports and export reports from
U.S. ports. Annual State program reports should be provided to the Office of the Management Authority (address given
above) for review no later than May 31 of each year. 



Proposed Findings 



The Service proposes to find that the status of the species and State programs is such that the 1995-1997 harvests
of American alligators for 
export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. Accordingly, the Service proposes to approve exports
of 1995-1997 harvested alligators from the States previously approved for export, including Arkansas, on
the grounds that both Scientific Authority and Management Authority export requirements have been satisfied. 



Comments Solicited 



The Service requests comments on these proposed findings. Final findings will take into consideration the comments
and any additional information received, and such consideration may lead to final findings that differ from this
proposal. 

The Service requests information on environmental or economic impacts and effects on small entities (including
small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions) that would result from findings
for or against export approval. This information may aid the Service in further evaluating the conclusions stated
below. This proposal is issued under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531


et seq

.; 87 Stat. 884, as amended) and was prepared by Carol L. Carson, Office of Management Authority. 



Effects of the Rule and Required Determinations 



The Service has determined that these proposed findings are not a major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), and therefore
the preparation of an environmental impact statement is not required. 

This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. For the 1995-97
harvest years, the Service analyzed the impacts and again concluded that the 3-year rule was not a major rule and did
not have significant economic effects on a substantial number of small entities as outlined under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). Because the proposed rule treats exports on a State-by-State basis and proposes to approve export in accordance
with State programs, the rule would have little effect on small entities in and of itself. The proposed rule would allow
continued international trade in American alligators in accordance with CITES, and it does not contain any Federalism
impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. 

It also has been determined that this proposed rule does not contain information collection requirements that require
approval by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.

(a) 1979-1997 harvests (wild and farm-raised for each year unless noted). 






3. Section 23.57 American alligator (

Alligator mississippiensis

), paragraph (b) introductory text and paragraphs (6)(1), (2), (4) and (5) are proposed to be revised as follows: 

(b) Condition on export: (1) Each hide must be clearly identified by a durable, permanently locking Convention export
tag bearing a legend showing the US-CITES logo, State of origin, species, season of take, and a unique serial number.
The tag must be inserted through the hide and permanently locked in place using the locking mechanism of the tag and
in accordance with State requirements. Hides with broken tags may not be exported. Upon submission of documentation
to show legality of the hide, broken tags may be replaced with CITES replacement. Hides with valid CITES replacement
tags are eligible for export. 

(2) US-CITES export tags that were removed from the hides used to manufacture products to be exported must be surrendered
to the Service prior to the export of those products. 

(3) * * * * * 

(4) Large individual parts shall have a parts tag permanently attached. Small parts such as tails, throats, feet,
or backstrips shall be packed in transparent, sealed containers clearly marked with a parts tag. Parts tags shall
supply at a minimum the State of origin, species, original hide export tag number, and weight of the parts in the container.


(5) American alligator skulls shall be marked as required by State law. This marking shall include, at a minimum, reference
to a valid US-CITES tag number.

North Atlantic Right Whale Protection

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR). 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document is in response to a petition requesting the issuance of regulations that will establish specific protection
zones around every northern right whale (as well as around all other whales). It solicits public comment and information
to assist in determining the need for and types of conservation measures that would be effective in minimizing human-induced
disturbance of and harmful interaction with northern right whales. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


The western North Atlantic population of northern right whales (

Eubalaena

 

glacialis

) is estimated to consist of 300-350 animals. Although protected by international agreements for over 50 years,
the growth rate of this population remains at an extremely low level relative to the growth rates of right whale populations
in the southern hemisphere that have been similarly protected (Kraus, 1990). It has been suggested that both natural
and human-induced factors are responsible for the absence of measurable growth in the northern right whale population.

One human-induced factor thought to be a substantial threat to the recovery of the northern right whale, as identified
in the Recovery Plan for Northern Right Whales (NMFS, 1991), developed under section 4(f) of the Endangered Species
Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1533(f), is disturbance by vessels. Northern right whale behavior occurring at the water's surface,
such as resting, skim feeding, and courtship, makes them susceptible to disturbance by vessels. Further, it appears
that vessel traffic has a measurable effect on large whales, including right whales. These effects include overt
changes in direction of swimming, changes in respiration patterns, changes in dive time/surface time ratios, and
changes in acoustic behaviors. In particular, right whale cows with calves and single long-diving whales appear
to be sensitive to sound and have been observed to avoid boats (Kraus and Mayo, unpubl. data). Finally, turbulence
associated with vessel traffic may also indirectly affect northern right whales by breaking up the dense surface
zooplankton patches in certain whale feeding areas. 
On October 5, 1994, NMFS received a petition from Greenworld, Inc. requesting that, in order to address this perceived
problem, NMFS issue regulations establishing a 500-yard (yd) (460 meter(m)) radius protection zone around
every right whale and, citing the similarity of appearance provision of section 4(e) of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. 1533(e),
a 100-yd (90m) radius protection zone around all other whales. The petition also suggested that any vessel approach
of a right whale closer than 500-yds (or 100-yds for other whales) be considered an incidental take under
the ESA. 
NMFS has previously received information suggesting similar actions. During the comment period following the proposed
rule to designate critical habitat for the right whale (final rule at 59 FR 28793, June 3, 1994), several commenters
recommended that a distance buffer be established around each right whale. To allow whales to avoid oncoming vessels
and vessels to avoid whales, commenters indicated that, at the time of critical habitat designation, restrictions
or modifications of shipping lanes and shipping practices needed to be made. Another commenter suggested that a minimum
vessel approach distance of 100-300m be established around right whales. Finally, a commenter recommended
that NMFS establish a 500m radius protection zone around every right whale in every area designated as critical habitat,
and prohibit any person from knowingly entering or remaining within this zone. T
