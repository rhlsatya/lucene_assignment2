The petitions were submitted pursuant to Section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341). Consequently, the United
States Department of Commerce has initiated separate investigations to determine whether increased imports into
the United States of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by each firm contributed importantly
to total or partial separation of the firm's workers, or threat thereof, and to a decrease in sales or production of
each petitioning firm. 

 Any party having a substantial interest in the proceedings may request a public hearing on the matter. A request for
a hearing must be received by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Division, Room 7023, Economic Development Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230, no later than the close of business on the tenth calendar day
following the publication of this notice. 

 The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance official program number and title of the program under which these petitions

On October 26, 1994, notice was published (59 FR 53780) that an application had been filed by the Oregon Department
of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) for a modification to their scientific research Permit 818. Under Permit 818, ODFW is allowed

in the take of this species for the period 1994-95 only and an expansion of their research sampling area to include
Catherine Creek in the Grande Ronde River Basin for the duration of the permit.
Notice is hereby given that on December 15, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification
4 to Permit 818 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. In Modification 4 to Permit 818,
NMFS included precautions that ODFW are required to implement to prevent accidental listed fish mortalities.
Issuance of this modification, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such modification: (1) Was applied
for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of the permit;
and (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This modification was also issued
in accordance with and is subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.
The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




On November 21, 1994, under the terms of Article 3 of the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles, done
at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on December 9, 1993, the Government of the United States requested
consultations with the Government of Guatemala with respect to men's and boys' wool suits in Category 443, produced
or manufactured in Guatemala.

The purpose of this notice is to advise the public that the request for consultations on Category 443 (men's and boys'
wool suits) was made based on year ending August 1994 trade of 63,959 units (5,330 dozen).

A summary market statement concerning Category 443 follows this notice.

Anyone wishing to comment or provide data or information regarding the treatment of Category 443, or to comment on
domestic production or availability of products included in this category, is invited to submit 10 copies of such
comments or information to Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, U.S.
Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; ATTN: Helen L. LeGrande. The comments received will be considered
in the context of the consultations with the Government of Guatemala.

Comments should be submitted promptly. Comments or information submitted in response to this notice will be available
for public inspection in the Office of Textiles and Apparel, room H3100, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.

Further comments may be invited regarding particular comments or information received from the public which the
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements considers appropriate for further consideration.

The solicitation of comments pursuant to the implementation of any appropriate agreement between the Governments
of the United States and Guatemala is not a waiver in any respect of the exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) relating
to matters which constitute ``a foreign affairs function of the United States.''

The United States remains committed to finding a solution concerning Category 443. Should such a solution be reached
in consultations with the Government of Guatemala, further notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

.

Import Situation and Conclusion



U.S. imports of men's and boys' wool suits, Category 443, from Guatemala began in September of 1993 and reached a 12
month year-ending August 1994 (September 1993-August 1994) level of 63,959 units (5,330 dozen). Guatemala's imports
in calendar year 1993 (September-December) were 7,915 units (660 dozen). There were no Category 443 imports from
Guatemala during the year-ending August 1993 nor during calendar year 1992. Guatemala shipped 1,930 units (161 dozen)
in calendar year 1991.

The sharp and substantial increase in Category 443 imports from Guatemala is disrupting the U.S. market for men's
and boys' wool suits.

<SIGNJOB>
U.S. Production, Import Penetration, and Market Share 


U.S. production of men's and boys' wool suits, Category 443, declined from 383,000 dozen in 1992 to 326,000 dozen in
1993, a 15 percent decrease. Production for the first half of 1994, at 164,000 dozen, was flat relative to the 162,000
dozen produced during January-June 1993. U.S. production for the year-ending June 1994 was 9 percent below the year-ending
June 1993 level. By contrast, U.S. imports increased from 278,000 dozen in 1992 to 309,000 dozen in 1993, an 11 percent
increase. Imports continued to increase in 1994, reaching a record level of 334,000 dozen for the year-ending August
1994, 11 percent above the 302,000 dozen imported during the same period a year earlier.

The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 73 percent in 1992 to 95 percent in 1993, and continued to
increase in 1994, reaching 100 percent during the year-ending June 1994_U.S. imports equalled U.S. production.
The U.S. producer's share of the domestic market fell from 58 percent in 1992 to 51 percent in 1993, a decline of seven
percentage points. The U.S. producer's share declined to 50 percent for the year-ending June 1994.

<SIGNJOB>
Duty-Paid Value and U.S. Producers' Price



All of Category 443 imports from Guatemala during the year ending August 1994 entered under HTSUSA number 6203.11.2000_men's
and boys' woven wool suits, containing less than 30 percent by weight of silk. These suits from Guatemala entered the
U.S. at landed duty-paid values below U.S. producers' prices for comparable wool suits.

<USDEPT>CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Civil Penalties; Notice of Adjusted Maximum Amounts </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Consumer Product Safety Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of adjusted maximum civil penalty amounts. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In 1990 Congress enacted statutory amendments which increased the maximum civil penalty amounts that could be imposed
under the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and the Flammable Fabrics Act. The amendments
also provided for periodic adjustments to those maximum amounts. As calculated in accordance with the amendments,
the new amounts are $6,000 for each violation, with a maximum of $1,500,000 for any related series of violations. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1990 (Improvement Act), Public Law 101-608, 104 Stat. 3110 (November
16, 1990) amended provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA)
and the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA). The Improvement Act added civil penalty authority to the FHSA and FFA, which had
previously only contained criminal penalties. 15 U.S.C.   1264(c) and 1194(e). The Improvement Act
also increased the maximum civil penalty amounts that would apply to civil penalties under the CPSA: $5000 per violation
and $1,250,000 for any related series of violations. These same maximum penalty amounts applied to the newly-created
civil penalties under the FHSA and FFA. 


The Improvement Act further directed that the maximum civil penalty amounts be adjusted periodically for inflation.
The CPSA, FHSA and FFA were amended to state: 




(A) The maximum penalty amounts authorized in paragraph (1) [the provision that sets the current maximum amounts
of $5,000 and $1,250,000] shall be adjusted for inflation as provided in this paragraph. 
(B) Not later than December 1, 1994, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe
and publish in the 

Federal Register

 a schedule of maximum authorized penalties that shall apply for violations that occur after January 1 of the year immediately
following such publication. 
(C) The schedule of maximum authorized penalties shall be prescribed by increasing each of the amounts referred to
in paragraph (1) by the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years. Any increase determined under the
preceding sentence shall be rounded to_ 
(i) in the case of penaties greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to $10,000, the nearest multiple of $1,000; 
(ii) in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 but less than or equal to $100,000, the nearest multiple of $5,000;

(iii) in the case of penalties greater than $100,000 but less than or equal to $200,000, the nearest multiple of $10,000;
and 
(iv) in the case of penalties greater than $200,000, the nearest multiple of $25,000. 
(D) For purposes of this subsection: 
(i) The term ``Consumer Price Index'' means the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department
of Labor. 
(ii) The term ``cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years'' means the percentage by which_ 
(I) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment; exceeds 
(II) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June preceding the date on which the maximum authorized penalty was last
adjusted. 




15 U.S.C.   2069(a)(3), 1264(c)(6) and 1194(e)(5). 


The Commission's Directorate for Economics has calculated that the cost-of-living adjustment increases the maximum
civil penalty amounts to $5,962.93 for each violation and to $1,490,733.28 for any related series of violations.
(The back-up information on these calculations is available from the Office of the Secretary.) Rounding off these
numbers in accordance with the statutory directions, the adjusted maximum amounts are $6,000 for each violation
and $1,500,000 for any related series of violations. These adjusted amounts substitute for the previous amounts
contained in the CPSA, 15 U.S.C.  2069(a)(1); in the FHSA, 15 U.S.C.  1264(c)(1); and in the FFA, 15 U.S.C.
 1194(e)(1). 
This 

Federal Register

 notice was not published before December 1, 1994. Therefore, the Commission has decided that the new maximum penalty
amounts should apply to violations that occur after January 26, 1995, rather than violations that occur after January
1, 1995. This provides a 30-day effective date; the Improvement Act anticipated that the adjusted penalties would
apply no earlier than one month after public notice in the 

Federal Register

.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice is to advise interested parties that Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC) has been designated as the first
national STS facility for liver transplants. The STS Program establishes new requirements for CHAMPUS beneficiaries
to obtain some highly specialized health care services from selected military and civilian treatment facilities.
These designations will be based on the highly specialized capabilities of those selected facilities. The purpose
of such designations is to concentrate patient referrals for certain highly specialized procedures which are of
relatively low incidence and/or relatively high per-case cost and which require patient concentration to permit
resource investment and enhance the effectiveness of quality assurance efforts.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 5, 1993, (58 FR 58964), the Department of Defense published a final rule on the STS Program. Included in
the final rule was a provision that a notice of all military and civilian STS Facilities be published in the 

Federal Register

 annually, including a listing of the several procedures subject to nationwide catchment area Nonavailability Statements
and the highly specialized procedures subject to 200-mile catchment area Nonavailability Statements. Based on
this provision, notice is given that WHMC is designated as the national STS facility for liver transplants.

<DOCTITLE>Lake Casitas Municipal Water District; Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment </DOCTITLE>


December 20, 1994. 


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a original, minor license for the Lake Casitas Power Recovery Facility (project), and has prepared
a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. The project is located on the Bureau of Reclamation's existing
pipeline between its Casitas dam and its water treatment plant, near the City of San Buena Ventura, in Ventura County,
California. 
In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential future environmental impacts of the project and has
concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective measures, would not constitute
a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. 
Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. 
Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,

10, 1995, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC, 20426, a petition to intervene or a
protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or
385.211) and the regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will
be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing
therein must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and procedure a hearing will be held without further notice before filed within the time required herein, and if the
Commission on its own review of the matter finds that the abandonment is required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a petition for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.

Under the procedure herein provide for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Tennessee to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing its call for nominations of estuaries to the National Estuary
Program (NEP). The Agency intends to streamline the operation of this program and is specifically seeking nominations
which further this approach. The Governor of any State or trust territory may nominate an estuary located wholly or
partly within the State to be included in the NEP. After evaluating the nominations received, the EPA will select estuaries
to be included in the NEP in Fiscal Year 1995.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The National Estuary Program (NEP) was established under section 320 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended by the
Water Quality Act of 1987. The purpose of the NEP is to promote long-term planning and management in nationally significant
estuaries threatened by pollution, development, or overuse. This goal is achieved through the preparation of a Comprehensive
Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) which documents the problems and recommends approaches for correcting
and preventing problems for each estuary. 
The NEP seeks to protect and improve water and sediment quality and to enhance living resources by helping to: 

 Establish working partnerships among federal, state, tribal, and local governments; 
 Fully utilize scientific and management experience in development of CCMPs; 
 Increase public awareness of pollution problems and ensure public participation in consensus building; 
 Promote basinwide planning to control pollution and manage living resources; and 
 Oversee development and implementation of pollution abatement and control programs. 

Under CWA section 320(a), the Governor of any State may nominate an estuary located wholly or partly within the State
and request that the Administrator of EPA convene a management conference to develop a CCMP for the estuary. Where
Tribal lands are located within estuary boundaries, the nomination should also include a letter of agreement from
the Tribal Governor or equivalent. Nominations must document the national significance of the estuary, the need
for a management conference, its likelihood of success, its ability to streamline, commitment to implement actions
and its organizational ability to oversee implementation. In response to a Governor's nomination or on his own initiative,
the Administrator is authorized to determine whether the attainment or maintenance of a desired level of water quality
in an estuary requires additional pollution abatement and control programs to supplement existing controls. Based
on this determination, the Administrator is authorized to convene management conferences for such estuaries. 

EPA has determined that the addition of new estuaries to the NEP beyond the existing 21 will foster environmental management
efforts in coastal areas. Based on this determination, the Administrator will convene additional management conferences
in Fiscal Year 1995. 



Preparation of Nominations 



Many of the elements of estuarine management employed in the NEP are being applied by public and private parties in
estuaries that are not currently part of the National Estuary Program. Substantial progress towards meeting some
NEP objectives has been realized in some of these estuaries. 

Based on these factors, and experience gained from the existing 21 management conferences, EPA believes it will be
possible to more quickly and economically develop CCMPs for estuaries to be designated in the future. Therefore,
when considering management conferences to be convened in Fiscal Year 1995, EPA will give preference to nominations
that describe actions underway to identify and characterize environmental problems and their causes, established
partnerships among governmental and private groups with natural resource management and protection missions,
public involvement in developing and executing action strategies, and the state's ability to support CCMP implementation.
The information kit provides further details on the information which should be presented in the nomination to allow
the Administrator to determine whether a candidate estuary should be selected for the NEP. 

Nominations should be prepared based on EPA's instruction kit entitled 

The Streamlined National Estuary Program: Instructions on the Preparation of a Governor's Nomination. 

The EPA will provide an instruction kit upon request to assist interested States in preparing their nominations.
This instruction kit includes background information, a copy of section 320 of the CWA, and nomination content checklist.
Requests for this instruction kit should be made to the US EPA Regional office that serves the interested state. Contact
names, phone numbers and addresses are provided in the ``

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Administrative Order On Consent; Petrochem Recycling Corp./Ekotek, Inc. Site, Salt Lake City, UT</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed 

de minimis

 settlements.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the requirements of section 122(i)(1) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act, as amended (CERCLA), notice is hereby given of two proposed 

de minimis

 settlements under section 122(g) concerning the Petrochem Recycling Corp./Ekotek, Inc., Site in Salt Lake City,
Utah (the Site). The first proposed Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) (Settlement 

#

1) requires 15 potentially responsible parties (PRP) to pay an aggregate total of $231,922.08 to resolve their liability
to the EPA related to response actions taken or to be taken at the Site. The terms of the proposed AOC for these settlements
are identical to that recently approved and made effective by EPA November 16, 1994 (See Federal Register notice,
dated September 2, 1994). Additionally, notice is given of four settlements that have changed from EPA's previous


de minimis

 settlement notice. The second proposed AOC (Settlement 

#

2) requires 22 potentially responsible parties (PRP) to pay an aggregate total of $357,111.00 to resolve their liability
to the EPA related to response actions taken or to be taken at the Site. The proposed AOC for Settlement 

#

2 involves settlement payments adjusted in consideration of the parties' ability to pay.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice of section 122(g) 

De Minimis

 Settlements: Settlement 

#

1: In accordance with section 122(i)(1) of CERCLA, notice is hereby given that the terms of an Administrative Order
on Consent (AOC) have been agreed to by the following 15 parties, for the following amounts: Option A Settlements:
Moser Engine Service ($772.20); The Walt Disney Company ($69,634.00); B&W Garage, Inc. ($5,384.70); Davis
County School District ($30,632.96); Transmission Limited ($11,985.30); Reo Mc Murdie ($1,173.44); Merritt Chevron
($8,059.68); Guy F. Atkinson Construction Company ($26,766.20); W&K Mobile Services, Inc. ($8,260.40); Western
Drive Train ($9,788.96); and Industrial Compliance (3120.81). Option B Settlements: Polyclad Laminates ($16,335.00);
Gus Paulos Chevrolet ($12,753.00); Holladay Conoco (Vaughn Smith Conoco) ($7,215.65); and Standard Transportation
($20,039.78).




By the terms of the proposed AOC, these PRPs will together pay $231,922.08 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund).
The $231,922.08 represents approximately 0.3% of the total anticipated costs for the Site upon which this settlement
was based.

In addition, the following settlements represent changes from the 

de minimis

 settlements listed in EPA's Federal Register notice of September 2, 1994, under the AOC identical to the settlement
noticed herein under Settlement 

#

1: Option A Settlements: Allied Petroleum of Reno ($51,384.32). Option B Settlements: ASF-24 (U.S. Army) ($3,528.36);
Discount Tire and Automotive, Inc. ($5,550.50); For Douglas (Transportation Motor Pool) ($20,092.05); and Parley's
Way Conoco ($4,701.60). EPA has determined that it is necessary to reissue the public notice for these settlements.

In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections
106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight
costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)).


The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above for Settlement 

#

1, equals $2.97 multiplied by the number of gallons of waste the party sent to the Site (Base Amount), plus a premium
payment of either 30% or 120% of the Base Amount, as specified by each Respondent PRP in the AOC. The per gallon charge
of $2.97 was calculated by dividing the total estimated response costs for the Site ($69,594,403) by the total estimated
volume of waste disposed of at the Site (23,454,592 gallons). For parties paying a 30% premium, the ``Option A'' settlement,
there is an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $69,594,403. If this amount
were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion of the overage. For parties paying the 120% premium,
the ``Option B'' settlement, the exception to the covenant not to sue does not apply.

Settlement #2: In accordance with section 122(i)(1) of CERCLA, notice is hereby given that the terms of an Administrative
Order on Consent (AOC) have been agreed to by the following 22 parties, for the following amounts: Clifford Motors
(a/k/a Steve Clifford Motors) ($1,500.00); Interstate Transmission (a/k/a Bailey Financial Corp.) ($1,800.00);
Barnes Amoco ($1,400.00); Rocky Mountain Lube ($2,000.00); Zippy Lube (n/k/a Estate of Virgil Ruhter, deceased)
($4,000.00); Bob's Oil Exchange & Car Wash ($25,000.00); Frank Fiksdal ($2,000.00); Tri-State Oil ($30,000.00);
Ray McKee (a/k/a Lonnie Ray McKee) ($1,000.00); Landers Salvage ($8,668.00); Al Moser Chevron ($2,200.00); Herzog
Brothers ($1,500.00); Crestwood Texaco ($1,893.00); O.N.O., Inc. (d/b/a Brigham Street Service) $3,600.00);
Desert Oil Company ($60,000.00); Horner's Chevron (Wayne Hormer) ($200.00); Refinoil Products (d/b/a gardner
Refinoil) ($500.00); Mesa Oil Company ($193,000.00); Al's Conoco (a/k/a Al Cazier's Conoco) ($200.00); A&W
Diesel Sales & Service, Inc. ($14,000.00); Kent's Amoco/Service ($1,500.00); and Bill & Vern's Service
($1,150.00).


By the terms of the proposed AOC for this settlement, these 22 PRPs will together pay $357,111.00 to the Hazardous Substance
Superfund (Superfund). The $357,111.00 represents approximately 0.5% of the total anticipated costs for the Site
upon which this settlement was based.


In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections
106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight
costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)).


The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above for Settlement #2, has been reduced in consideration of
the ability of the settling party to pay. EPA has determined that the settling parties cannot afford EPA's least expensive


de minimis

 settlement option offered to 

sde minimis

 parties at the Site; that is, the ``Option A'' settlement. The settlement amount for each settling party has been reduced
to the maximum amount EPA has determined the party is able to pay. Each settling parties' settlement amount equals
$2.97 (derived and described above) multiplied by the number of gallons of waste the party sent to the Site (Base Amount),
plus a premium payment of 30% of the Base Amount, minus an adjustment reflecting EPA's determination that the party
is unable to pay the full settlement amount, referred to in the AOC as the ``inability-to-pay factor.'' The proposed
AOC for all settlors participating in Settlement #2 contains an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response
costs at the Site exceed $69,594,403. If this amount were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion
of the overage.


For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, the public may submit comments to U.S. EPA relating
to the proposed 

de minimis

 settlements.


A copy of the proposed AOCs may be obtained from Greg Phoebe (8HWM-SR), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202-2405, (303) 294-7036. Additional background

de minimis

 settlement is available for review at the Superfund Records Center at the above address, and at the Mariott Library,

Policy Statement Concerning Official Names of Farm Credit System Institutions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farm Credit Administration.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Policy statement.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Act of 1971 (1971 Act), as amended, gives the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) broad powers to issue
and amend the charters of Farm Credit System (System) institutions and regulate the exercise of their powers. The
FCA Board has concluded that institutions should have the maximum degree of flexibility possible in proposing official
names for their institutions and should not have to use trade names that are more commonly accepted than their official
names. At the same time, the official name of an institution should always be one that can be readily identified by the
public as belonging to an institution affiliated with the System. In addition, there must be a simple way for the public
and the FCA to be able to identify the name as belonging to one of the various types of institutions regulated by the FCA.
To reaffirm, by formal FCA Board Action, the continuing validity of the policy statement which requires Farm Credit
Banks and associations to include as a part of their official name their statutory or regulatory designation or the
appropriate acronym, the FCA Board has reaffirmed its policy statement on Farm Credit Institution Names adopted
by the FCA Board and stated in the preamble to the 

Federal Register

 notice of final rule published December 15, 1988 at 53 FR 50387-50388.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The text of the Board's policy statement concerning official names of Farm Credit System institutions is set forth
below in its entirety: 



FCA Board Action on Policy Statement Concerning, Official Names of Farm Credit System Institutions, BM-13-Oct-94-02,
FCA-PS-63. 



Effective Date:

 October 13, 1994. 



Effect on Previous Action:

 Reaffirmation of the Policy Statement on Farm Credit Institution Names adopted by the FCA Board and stated in the preamble
to the 

Federal Register

 notice of final rule December 15, 1988 at 53 FR 50387-50388. 



Source of Authority:

 Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, sections 1.3(b), 2.0(b)(8), 2.10(c), 3.0, 5.17(a)(2)(A), 7.0, 7.6(a), 7.8(a);
12 CFR part 611. 

The FCA Board hereby reaffirms the policy statement on Farm Credit Institution names adopted by the FCA Board and stated
in the preamble to the 

Federal Register

 Notice of final rule published December 15, 1988 at 53 FR 50387-50388. 



Purpose:

 To ensure that the public can identify the name of the Farm Credit institution as belonging to one of the various types
of institutions regulated by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA). To allow the maximum flexibility possible for
Farm Credit Banks and associations in proposing official names for their institutions. To ensure that the various
types of institutions can be easily identified by the FCA for regulation and examination purposes. 



Objective:

 To reaffirm, by formal FCA Board Action, the continuing validity of the policy statement which was first adopted in
1988 and which requires Farm Credit Banks and associations to include as a part of their official name their statutory
or regulatory designation or the appropriate acronym. Also, to ensure that the official names recorded in all charters
and charter amendments that are requested by the Farm Credit Banks and associations and issued by the FCA follow the
policy specifications. 



Operating Principles:

 With the exception of the provisions of section 413 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (1987 Act) regarding the
National Bank for Cooperatives, the 1987 Act and the Farm Credit Act of 1971 as amended (the Act), do not expressly require
any of the various types of banks and associations to use a specific name in its official title. However, prior to the
1987 Act, the Act referred to each of the different banks and associations by using specific names such as ``production
credit association,'' ``Federal land bank association,'' and ``bank for cooperatives.'' Based on these statutory
references, the FCA, in granting charters to institutions, has required that the official names of institutions
include the appropriate name used in the statute. Thus, for instance, associations chartered under title II of the
Act were required to use ``production credit association'' as part of their official name.

Enactment of the 1987 Act, particularly the provisions authorizing the merger of unlike banks and associations,
has caused the FCA to reevaluate its policies regarding the official names of institutions. The FCA Board has concluded
that institutions should have the maximum flexibility possible in proposing official names for their institutions.
At the same time, the official name of an institution should always be one that can be readily identified as belonging
to one of the various types of institutions regulated by the FCA. For instance, one must be able to know whether a bank
can lend to cooperatives, like a bank for cooperatives, or whether an association can only make short-term loans,
like a PCA. 

The FCA Board has now determined that it will issue charters for institutions which contain the statutorily sanctioned
names ``production credit association,'' Federal land bank association,'' ``bank for cooperatives,'' and ``Farm
Credit Bank.'' If an institution requests an official name that does not incorporate one of those terms, the official
name must include the acronym for the appropriate term after the name. For instance, the Production Credit Association
of North Central Jersey could request a change in its name to ``Farm Credit Services of North Central Jersey, PCA.''
The FCA Board will also issue charters for institutions that contain the name ``agricultural credit association,''
for an association formed by the merger of a production credit association and a Federal land bank association, the
name ``Federal land credit association,'' for a Federal land bank association that has direct lending authority,
and the name ``agricultural credit bank,'' for a bank formed by the merger of a Farm Credit Bank and a bank for cooperatives.
If such an institution requests an official name that does not include the appropriate term, the name must be followed
by the acronym ``ACA,'' ``FLCA,'' or ``ACB.'' For instance, a Federal land bank association that has acquired direct
lending authority could use names such as ``Farm Credit of Central City, FLCA,'' or ``Federal Land Bank Association
of Central City, FLCA.'' 



Delegation of Authority:

 Any delegation of authority relative to approval of or changes to Farm Credit institution names will be covered under
FCA Board Policy Statement on Rules for the Transaction of Business and Operational Responsibilities of the FCA Board,
No. FCA-PS-58 as adopted 07-FEB-94 and as it may be amended. 



Reporting Requirements:

 The Corporate Affairs Division (CAD) will provide to the Office of the Board a copy of any approved charter amendment
request. The CAD will also summarize all charter amendments and charter issuances in its quarterly 

Corporate Restructuring

 report.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 





Background



On June 15, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delegated to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (Board) its approval authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as per 5 CFR 1320.9, to approve of
and assign OMB control numbers to collection of information requests and requirements conducted or sponsored by
the Board under conditions set forth in 5 CFR 1320.9. Board-approved collections of information will be incorporated
into the official OMB inventory of currently approved collections of information. A copy of the OMB 83I and supporting
statement and the approved collection of information instrument(s) will be placed into OMB's public docket files.
The following forms, which are being handled under this delegated authority, have received initial Board approval
and are hereby published for comment. At the end of the comment period, the proposed information collection, along
with an analysis of comments and recommendations received, will be submitted to the Board for final approval under
OMB delegated authority.

Abstract:

 The Federal Reserve proposes to reduce the reporting frequency from once a month to once a year, and to eliminate nine
of the thirteen items on the report. The panel selection criterion for future panel additions would change from the
100 most active issuers to those whose acceptances outstanding exceed $50 million on their quarterly condition reports.
The proposed revisions would reduce the annual reporting burden for this report by 97 percent.

employment. The notice is a compliance vehicle for rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and for related
securities and banking laws. It is also a source document for updating information on an interagency computer system
of records. The proposed revisions involve changing the phrasing of one item on the FR MSD-4.

held at U.S. offices of depository institutions, converted to U.S. dollars and included in the FR 2900 (OMB No. 7100-0087),
the principal deposits report that is used for the calculation of required reserves and for construction of the monetary
and reserves aggregates. Foreign currency deposits are subject to reserve requirements and, therefore, are included
in the FR 2900. However, foreign currency deposits are not included in the monetary aggregates. The FR 2915 data are
used to back foreign currency deposits out of the FR 2900 data for construction of the monetary aggregates. The FR 2915
data also are used to monitor the volume of foreign-currency deposits. 
The Federal Reserve proposes to reduce the reporting frequency for current monthly reporters to quarterly. The proposed
revision would reduce the annual reporting burden for this report by 66 percent.

General description of report:

 This information collection is mandatory to obtain or retain a benefit [12 U.S.C. 1844(b) and (c)] and is given confidential
treatment [5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)]. 



Abstract: 

This report is filed by bank holding companies that have received the Board's approval by Order to engage in limited
underwriting and dealing in securities of a type which a bank may not underwrite or deal in directly. The report consists
of a balance sheet, statement of income, supporting schedules for securities owned, and a statement of changes in
stockholders' equity. In addition, there are several memoranda items which collect information on intercompany
liabilities and off-balance sheet items, and information that is needed for an alternative measure of indexed-revenue.
The proposed minor change, to become effective as of December 31, 1994, involves the addition of memoranda items on
the income statement to collect year-to-date gross income, total expenses, and net income. 



By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 20, 1994.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given of initial approval, and public comment is requested, by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the Board) under delegated authority from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as per 5 CFR 1320.9
(OMB Regulations on Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public), to the revision of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C; OMB No. 7100-0128); the extension, with revision, of
the Annual Report of Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-6; OMB No. 7100-0124), the Combined Financial Statements
of Nonbank Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-11Q; OMB No. 7100-0244) and the Annual Report
of Selected Financial Data for Nonbank Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-11I; OMB No. 7100-0218);
and the elimination of the Combined Financial Statements of Nonbank Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies, by Type
of Nonbank Subsidiary (FR Y-11AS; OMB No. 7100-0244). Following review of public comments, the Board
will take final action. The proposed reporting changes, summarized in this notice, will be effective for the FR Y-9C,
FR Y-11Q, and FR Y-11AS with the March 31, 1995 reporting date and effective for the FR Y-11I for the
December 31, 1995 reporting date. The Federal Reserve anticipates making the proposed reporting changes to the FR
Y-6 effective December 1994 unless significant objections from the public are received during the comment
period. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
General Information 


Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, the Board is responsible for the supervision and regulation
of all bank holding companies. The FR Y-9 and FR Y-11 series of reports historically have been, and continue
to be, the primary source of financial information on bank holding companies and their nonbanking activities between
on-site inspections. Financial information, as well as ratios developed from the Y series reports, are used to detect
emerging financial problems, to review performance for pre-inspection analysis, to evaluate bank holding company
mergers and acquisitions, and to analyze a holding company's overall financial condition and performance as part
of the Federal Reserve System's overall analytical effort. The FR Y-6 report is the Federal Reserve's principal
source of internally generated and independently audited financial data on individual bank holding companies and
their banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. The report enables the Federal Reserve to monitor bank holding company
operations and to ensure that the operations are conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with the provisions
of the Bank holding Company Act and Regulation Y. 





Proposal to approve under OMB delegated authority the revision of: 
Report Title:

 Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies 


Agency Form Number: 

FR Y-9C 


OMB Docket Number:

 7100-0128 


Frequency:

 Quarterly 


Reporters:

 Bank Holding Companies 


Annual Reporting Hours:

 172,720 


Estimated Average Hours per Response:

 Range from 5 to 1,250 hours 

Number of Respondents:

Small businesses are affected. 



The information collection is mandatory [12 U.S.C. 1844(b) and (c)]. Confidential treatment is not routinely given
to the data in these reports. However, confidential treatment for the reporting information, in whole or in part,
can be requested in accordance with the instructions to the form. 
The Legal Division has also determined that on the FR Y-9C, Schedule HC-H, Column A, requiring information on
``assets past due 30 through 89 days and still accruing'' and memoranda item 2 are confidential pursuant to Section
(b)(8) of the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)].

The FR Y-9C consolidated financial statements are currently filed by top-tier bank holding companies with
total consolidated assets of $150 million or more and by lower-tier bank holding companies that have total consolidated
assets of $1 billion or more. In addition, all multibank bank holding companies with debt outstanding to the general
public or engaged in certain nonbank activities, regardless of size, must file the FR Y-9C. The following bank
holding companies are exempt from filing the FR Y-9C, unless the Board specifically requires an exempt company
to file the report: bank holding companies that are subsidiaries of another bank holding company and have total consolidated
assets of less than $1 billion; bank holding companies that have been granted a hardship exemption by the Board under
section 4(d) of the Bank Holding Company Act; and foreign banking organizations as defined by section 211.23(b) of
Regulation K. 

The report includes a balance sheet, income statement, and statement of changes in equity capital with supporting
schedules providing information on securities, loans, risk-based capital, deposits, interest sensitivity, average
balances, off-balance sheet activities, past due loans, and loan charge-offs and recoveries. 

The Federal Reserve proposes the following revisions to the FR Y-9C. Most of the proposed new items are needed
to maintain consistency with comparable items recently proposed or previously added to the commercial bank Reports
of Condition and Income (Call Report). 

A. Revisions related to consistent reporting with the Call 
Report: 



Schedule HC-A, Securities 



(1) Report separately as memoranda items the amortized cost and fair value of any high-risk mortgage securities and
any structured notes. 

(2) Modify the reporting instructions for the category labeled ``mortgage-backed securities'' to capture more
securities of this nature. In addition, the caption for the existing item of collateralized mortgage obligations
(CMOs) and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association
(FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) would be modified to explicitly refer to the REMICs
that the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) has recently begun to issue. 



Schedule HC-F, Off-Balance Sheet Items



Revise Part 2 to collect more comprehensive information on derivative instruments, including further breakdowns
of notional contract amounts by instrument type, by risk exposure underlying the contract, and by whether the contract
is traded on the exchange or over the counter and total notional amount and gross positive and gross negative fair values
of contracts held for trading purposes and for purposes other than trading. 



Schedule HI, Income Statement 



Add memoranda items to collect trading revenue that reflects the combined revenues from cash and derivative instruments,
with a breakdown by underlying risk exposure, and information on the effect on earnings of derivatives held for purposes
other than trading. 



Schedules HC-I and HC-J, Risk-Based Capital 



(1) Add an item to collect the net credit exposure of all derivative contracts taking into consideration netting arrangements
permissible under the risk-based capital standards. 

(2) Expand the risk-based capital ``notional principal value, maturity and replacement cost matrix'' for derivatives
to include an additional remaining maturity time band and four additional categories of derivative contracts (gold,
other precious metals, other commodity and equity contracts). 



Schedule HI-B, Charge-offs and Recoveries and Changes in Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 



Delete Memoranda, Part 2, Column B, the reconciliation of the allocated transfer risk reserve. 



Schedule of Trading Account Assets and Liabilities 



Add a schedule for the reporting of trading account assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with the schedule
currently included in the Call Report. This schedule would be completed only by bank holding companies with total
consolidated assets of $1 billion or more, or with $2 billion or more in par/notional amounts of interest rate, foreign
exchange rate and other commodity and equity contracts. 



Mutual Funds and Annuities Information

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-2-00062 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Add line items to collect quarterly gross sales of mutual funds (by type of fund) and annuities, including sales of
proprietary mutual funds and annuities, and the fee income generated from the sale and servicing of mutual funds and
annuities in domestic offices. 



Gross Redemptions of Mutual Funds and Annuities 



Add a line item to collect the total amount of gross redemptions of mutual funds and annuities during the quarter. 

B. Minor clarifications to the existing report forms and instructions: 

Revise the wording of Schedule HC-J, Part 3, line item 3 to conform with the intent of the existing instructions.
The current wording of this line item ``unsecured commitments,'' will be revised to read as ``unutilized commitments.''
In addition, minor instructional clarifications will be implemented based on comments received from the industry
and Reserve Banks.

 


Proposal to approve under OMB delegated authority the extension, with revision, of the following reports: 

1. Report Title:

 Annual Report of Bank Holding Companies 


Agency Form Number:

 FR Y-6 


OMB Docket Number:

 7100-0124 


Frequency:

 Annual 


Reporters:

 Bank Holding Companies 


Annual Reporting Hours:

 21,972 


Estimated Average Hours per Response:

 Range from 1.3 to 101 hours per response 


Number of Respondents:

 5,493 


Small businesses are affected.






The information collection is mandatory [12 U.S.C. 1844(b) and (c)] and 12 CFR 225.5 of Regulation Y. Confidential
treatment is not routinely given to the information in these reports. However, confidential treatment for the report
information can be requested, in whole or part, in accordance with the instructions to the form. 

The FR Y-6 is an annual report filed by the top-tier bank holding companies. Foreign banking organizations as
defined by section 211.23(b) of Regulation K are not required to file this form. 

The FR Y-6 consists of consolidated and parent company financial statements in the company's own format. Additionally,
financial statements for the nonbank subsidiaries of the holding company and information on the identity, percentage
ownership, and business interests of principal shareholders, directors, and executive officers are included in
the report. Amendments to the organizational documents, information on insider loans, and an organization chart
are also currently required. 

The Federal Reserve proposes the following revisions to the FR Y-6: 

(1) Eliminate the requirement to submit consolidated and parent company financial statements.

(2) Revise the requirement for audited financial statements to include only holding companies with assets of $500
million or more.

(3) Eliminate the requirement to submit nonbank subsidiary financial statements. Incorporate this information
into an expanded standardized FR Y-11 report as discussed below.

(4) Eliminate the requirement to submit certified copies of amendments to organizational documents.

(5) Eliminate the collection of information on insiders loans.

(6) Eliminate the confirmation of changes in investments and activities.

Small businesses are affected.






The information collection is mandatory [12 U.S.C. 1844(b) and (c)] and 12 CFR 225.5(b). Confidential treatment
is not routinely given to the data in these reports. However, confidential treatment for the report information,
in whole or in part, can be requested in accordance with the instructions to the form.

The FR Y-11Q is filed by all bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more, regardless
of whether or not the bank holding companies own any nonbank subsidiaries and by all bank holding companies with total
assets of $150 million or more but less than $1 billion that meet one or more of the following conditions: (a) the assets
of the holding company's nonbank subsidiaries constitute 5 percent or more of the holding company's total consolidated
assets; or (b) the net income of the holding company's nonbank subsidiaries make up 5 percent or more of the holding
company's total consolidated net income; or (c) the holding company's investment in and/or loans and advances to
nonbank subsidiaries exceed 5 percent of the holding company's total consolidated equity capital.

The report collects basic financial information on nonbank subsidiaries and consists of a balance sheet, income
statement, and a memoranda section.

The Federal Reserve proposes the following revisions to the FR Y-11Q:

(1) Expand the report to collect more detailed financial information, comparable to items collected on the FR Y-9C.
The proposed comprehensive financial statements include a balance sheet, off-balance sheet items, a memoranda
section, an income statement, and a statement of changes in equity capital.

(2) Revise the reporting criteria for bank holding companies with assets of $150 or more to collect information on
an individual basis from each nonbank subsidiary viewed as having a significant effect on the condition of the bank
holding company. All bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $150 million or more would file a report
for each individual nonbank subsidiary with total assets equal to 5 percent or more of the bank holding company's consolidated
Tier 1 capital, or where the subsidiary's total operating revenue equals 5 percent or more of the bank holding company's
consolidated total operating revenue.

directly or indirectly owned. Combined and consolidated reporting is permitted in some instances. Foreign banking
organizations are not required to file the report.

The report consists of ten summary financial items and two items providing consolidation information.

The Federal Reserve proposes the following revisions to the FR Y-11I:

(1) Expand the report to collect more detailed financial information, comparable to items proposed for the FR Y-11Q
but with certain detail reported only as summary items. The proposed financial statements will include a balance
sheet, income statement, off-balance sheet, and a statement on changes in equity capital. The FR Y-11I will
also include a loan schedule to be submitted only by respondents engaged in credit extending activities.

(2) Revise the reporting criteria to collect information on an individual basis annually from each nonbank subsidiary
not required to file the proposed FR Y-11Q.






Proposal to approve under OMB delegated authority the elimination of:

Report Title: 

Combined Financial Statements of Nonbank Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies, by Type of Nonbank Subsidiary

The information collection is mandatory [12 U.S.C. 1844(b) and (c)] and 12 CFR 225.5(b). Confidential treatment
is not routinely given to the data in these reports. However, confidential treatment for the report information,
in whole or in part, can be requested in accordance with the instructions to the form.

The FR Y-11AS is filed by all bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more, regardless
of whether or not the bank holding companies own any nonbank subsidiaries and by all bank holding companies with total
assets of $150 million or more but less than $1 billion that meet one or more of the following conditions: (a) The assets
of the holding company's nonbank subsidiaries constitute 5 percent or more of the holding company's total consolidated
assets; or (b) the net income of the holding company's nonbank subsidiaries make up 5 percent or more of the holding
company's total consolidated net income; or (c) the holding company's investment in and/or loans and advances to
nonbank subsidiaries exceed 5 percent of the holding company's total consolidated equity capital.

The report collects the same report items as the FR Y-11Q by type of nonbank activity and consists of a balance
sheet, income statement, and a memoranda section. The Federal Reserve proposes to eliminate this report.



Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis



The Board certifies that the above bank holding company reporting requirements are not expected to have a significant
economic impact on small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The
reporting requirements for the small companies require significantly fewer items of data to be submitted than the
amount of information required of large bank holding companies.

The information that is collected on the reports is essential for the detection of emerging financial problems, the
assessment of a holding company's financial condition and capital adequacy, the performance of pre-inspection
reviews, and the evaluation of expansion activities through mergers and acquisitions. The imposition of the reporting
requirements is essential for the Board's supervision of bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act.

ACTION: 

Notice.







This notice invites comments on proposed clauses that will implement industrial funding of the Federal Supply Service,
Federal Supply Schedule Program. As directed by the House of Representatives' Committee on Appropriations, the
Federal Supply Service of GSA has examined a number of alternatives for reimbursable funding of several of its programs
for which it currently receives appropriations. The Federal Supply Schedule Program was identified as appropriate
for conversion to an industrially funded operation. It has been determined that the most viable method of reimbursable
funding of schedule program would be through adjusting the schedule contract prices upward by 1%.

Under this concept, schedule pricelists would show the adjusted price. Agencies would order from the contractor
at the adjusted price; the contractor would invoice GSA at the award price; GSA would bill agencies the adjusted price
and retain the difference to fund the program. This method of funding is consistent with a National Performance Review
recommendation that GSA service operations be paid for through customer revenues. Under this concept, agencies
would continue to submit purchase/delivery orders directly to the contractor; however, contractor invoices would
be sent to GSA for payment.



</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background



The Federal Supply Schedule Program is a major contracting program used by the Federal Supply Service (FSS) to provide
a variety of commercial supplies and services to Federal Government agencies. The program accounts for over $2.8
billion in sales annually, and provides lucrative contracting opportunities for over 5,000 commercial contractors,
most of which are small business entities.

During the fiscal year 1994 budget process, Congress directed FSS to review its appropriated activities for conversion
to reimbursable funding. Based upon that review, the schedules program was identified as one of the programs suitable
for reimbursable funding. The GSA fiscal year 1995 budget, therefore, reflected a $7.8 million reduction in operating
expenses for the schedules program. The remaining appropriated monies will be eliminated over the next two fiscal
years. The cost of providing supplies and services through this program must therefore be included in the cost of those
supplies and services. FSS will accomplish this by adjusting each schedule contract award price upwards by 1%. For
example, a retail price for an item is $100.00. GSA negotiates a discount of 10 percent resulting in an award price of
$90.00. The schedule pricelist will reflect an adjusted price of $90.90. The contractor delivers the goods to the
agency and invoices GSA in the amount of $90.90 (the award price). GSA bills the agency the adjusted schedule pricelist
amount of $90.90. GSA retains the $.90 adjustment as it cost recovery allowance charge, thereby funding the program.

Currently, schedule contractors must submit invoices to multiple agencies' payment offices. FSS proposes to establish
the GSA Kansas City Finance office as the single payment point for all schedule contractors' invoices. Implementation
of industrial funding for the schedules program will have minimal impact on the basic principles of the program. Schedule
offers will continue to be evaluated and negotiated by GSA. The Government's pricing goal will continue to be most
favored customer status.

Agencies will continue to place orders directly with the schedule contractors. Agencies will also continue to use
Activity Address Codes (AAC) and Fund codes that they are using in the current supply systems. Agencies without AAC's
can obtain them by following the simple instructions in the GSA FEDSTRIP Operating Guide, or they can contact the FSS
System, Inventory, & Operations Management Center, (703) 305-7083. Fund codes are assigned within each
individual agency.

All contract administration matters relating to agencies' orders remain the responsibility of the agencies placing
the orders. As envisioned, the only change in the process will be in the area of payment. Instead of invoicing the individual
agencies, contractors will submit their invoices to GSA for payment.

GSA has planned a 3-year implementation period for converting all schedules to a full cost recovery program; however,
the implementation plan may be expedited contingent and consistent with changes in GSA's appropriations.

For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the proposed notice would impose no new reporting or record keeping requirements.

Subject: Industrial Funding of Federal Supply Schedule Program.


1. 

Purpose. 

To provide guidance for industrial funding of the Federal Supply Schedule program in order to recover associated
procurement and administrative costs incurred by the Federal Supply Service (FSS) for contracting through the schedules
program.
2. 

Background. 

During the fiscal 1994 budget process, Congress directed FSS to review its appropriated activities for conversion
to reimbursable funding. Based upon that review, the schedules program was identified as one of the programs suitable
for reimbursable funding. The GSA fiscal year 1995 budget, therefore, reflected a $7.8 million reduction in operating
expenses for the schedules program. The remaining appropriated monies for the program will be eliminated over the
next two fiscal years. The cost of providing supplies and services through this program must therefore be included
in the cost of those supplies and services.
The Federal Supply Schedule Program is FSS' largest supply support program, accounting for over $2.8 billion in sales
annually. The program benefits the customer agencies, as well as the contractors who participate in the program.
Federal agencies benefit from the schedules program because it provides an expedited means for acquiring quality
commercial products, including latest technology, at reasonable prices based on the Government's aggregate buying
power. Contractors benefit from the program because it provides them a low cost entry into the Federal market. By obtaining
a schedule contract with GSA, contractors avoid the administrative cost of responding to multiple solicitations
from many different agencies.
In order to better serve our customers and suppliers, FSS is implementing a single payment office, GSA, to handle schedule
invoices. Agencies will continue to forward delivery/purchase orders directly to the schedule contractors, who
will in turn deliver requisitioned items directly to the agencies. However, instead of invoicing the agencies, the
contractors will submit their invoices (for both supplies and services) to the GSA Office of Finance for payment.
GSA will bill the agencies. (See attached Outline of Payment/Billing Steps.)
The new payment arrangement eliminates the agencies' responsibilities related to processing and paying thousands
of invoices. Government payment offices will be billed twice a month by GSA. Based on the above, agencies should enjoy
substantial administrative savings.
GSA, as the single paying office, will be able to maximize timely payments, thus, avoiding interest charges and earning
prompt payment discounts.
Schedule contractors will benefit by not having to deal with numerous agency accounts payable offices. Further,
they will no longer have to cope with a variety of different accounts payable procedures, since they will only be subject
to GSA's procedures. As the single payment office, GSA's commendable record for timely payment of invoices will result
in contractors being paid much quicker than many are now experiencing from some schedule users.
GSA will recover the costs associated with contracting, billing, and payment of schedule purchases by adjusting
the awarded price upward by one percent. This adjusted price will be the price printed in the schedule contract pricelist.


GSA's negotiation objectives will include consideration of the new simplified payment terms and conditions and
will seek discount concessions recognizing the benefits to contractors of streamlined payment procedures. Contractors
will bill GSA at the negotiated contract prices. GSA's billings to ordering activities will be at the printed schedule
pricelist amounts.
The present strategy calls for a 3-year implementation beginning in fiscal year 1995. As current schedules expire,
new basic solicitations will include the new clauses which will provide for funding of the program. At the completion
of the 3-year implementation period, any existing contracts that do not contain the new clauses will be modified to
incorporate these provisions. The implementation schedule may be expedited contingent and consistent with changes
in GSA's appropriations.
3. 

Effective Date.

 This Acquisition Letter becomes effective two weeks after its signature date.
4. 

Expiration Date.

 This Acquisition Letter expires one year from the effective date, or upon inclusion in the Supply Operations Handbook,
FSS P 2901.2A, whichever occurs earlier.

5. 

Applicability. 

All Federal Supply Service schedule contracting activities must implement the provisions of this acquisition letter.
All basic schedule solicitations issued on or after the effective date of this letter must contain the new clause and
notice shown in the attachment. Schedule solicitations that have been issued, but not opened/closed, must be amended
to include the new schedule payment and billing procedures. Appropriate solicitation extensions should be provided
to allow offerors sufficient time to consider the new provisions. In addition, multiple award solicitations which
have closed, but have no awards against them yet, should be amended to incorporate the new provisions. Offerors should
be requested to acknowledge, in writing, their acceptance of the new provisions within the terms of their offer, prior
to the award of a contract. If an offeror is unwilling to accept the new single payment arrangements, he/she will be
allowed to withdraw his/her offer.

6. 

Reference to Regulations. 

HB, Supply Operations ch. 38, (FSS P 2901.2A.)

7. 

Instructions/procedures.

a. Promoting the advantages of a ``one-stop'' payment office will be the responsibility of all persons involved with
schedule contracting. Benefits are realized by customer agencies, schedule contractors, GSA, and the taxpayers.
Every effort should be made to inform contractors and agencies of the advantages of designating GSA as the single payment
point. Equally important is the need to encourage both agencies and contractors to maximize their use of Electronic
Data Interchange (EDI) to transmit purchase/delivery orders and invoices. Contractors may also receive Electronic
Fund Transfer (EFT) payments, whether they submit paper or electronic invoices.

b. In order to facilitate the payment and billing process by Finance, agencies will be required to include the Activity
Address Code (AAC) to be billed, and a two digit Fund Code to be charged on each purchase/delivery order submitted to
contractors. These codes will expedite GSA's process for billing the agencies for reimbursement of monies paid by
GSA to the contractors. Inclusion of the AAC and Fund code on all purchase/delivery orders is required before invoicing
GSA.

c. (1) The Catalogs and/or Pricelists clauses will be revised to instruct schedule contractors to adjust the awarded
schedule prices upward by 1%. Purchase/delivery orders will show this adjusted price. Contractors, on the other
hand will invoice GSA at the awarded (unadjusted) prices.) For example:






(2) Contractors will also be instructed to include a statement substantially as follows on the cover page, or in order
instructions on the pricelist: ``Agencies are reminded to include the Activity Address Code (AAC) to be billed and
the Fund code to be charged on each purchase/delivery order. These codes are needed to expedite payment of invoices
and billings by GSA to agencies.'' Contractors may also include a sample order form for informational purposes to
assist agencies in including all pertinent information.

d. In addition to the AAC and Fund code and other standard information included on the purchase/delivery order, agencies
should provide the following with each order:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-2-00073 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-2-00051 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. Two agency contact points (including commercial phone number): one from the ordering office, and, one from the
office to receive the billing from GSA. 

2. Cite GSA as the office to be invoiced for payment. 

e. During the initial phase of this changeover to a single payment office, contracting officers may receive inquiries
from agencies and schedule contractors regarding the billing AAC and Fund code. The six-digit AAC is a code assigned
to an agency in order to establish an account with GSA. The AAC identifies the agency to GSA. Agencies may obtain AAC
numbers by writing to: GSA/FSS, Inventory and Requisition Management Division (FCSI), Washington, DC 20406, or
calling (703) 305-6978. Fund codes are not assigned by GSA but by each individual agency. 

f. In addition to submitting purchase/delivery orders directly to the contractor via hard copy or EDI, agencies may
also obtain schedule items by placing requisitions through MUFFIN (Multi-Use File for Inter-Agency News), or normal
FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP ordering procedures. 

g. Agencies shall forward an original and one copy of paper purchase/delivery orders to schedule contractors. Any
oral order placed against a schedule contract must be confirmed with either an electronic (EDI) or hard copy purchase/delivery
order. 

h. The Office of Finance, Kansas City, will be the payment office for all schedule invoices. For paper invoices containing
prompt payment discount terms, the address is: General Services Administration, PO Box 419399, Kansas City, MO 64141-6399.
All other paper invoices should be sent to General Services Administration, PO Box 419029, Kansas City, MO 64141-6029.
Initial invoices for each purchase/delivery order must be accompanied with a copy of the customer paper or EDI order.
Contractor EDI submissions of order data and invoices must be in accordance with Federal implementation conventions
for EDI. 

i. As is the current practice, ordering activities will resolve any discrepancies concerning purchase/delivery
orders and/or items delivered against such orders directly with the schedule contractors. The GSA contracting officer
may need to intervene in order to settle unresolved issues between an ordering activity, a contractor and/or the Office
of Finance. Any setoffs for collection of monies owed the Government must be handled in accordance with FAR Subpart
32.6. 

j. The contractor represents by submission of an invoice that the supplies have been delivered or services performed
satisfactorily. GSA reserves the right to require proof of shipment or evidence of delivery/performance prior to
payment. 

k. Pursuant to the clause, Examination of Records by GSA (552.215-70) and FAR, Subpart 4.7, contractors are
required to retain files, records, and information relevant to this contract, including records to support shipments
and deliveries for up to 3 years after final payment, or as specified in Subpart 4.705 through 4.705-3, whichever
of these periods expire first. 

l. GSA, Office of Finance will implement a post payment statistically reliable system to validate agency receipt
of goods or services. 

m. The following clause and cover page notice must be included in all new basic Federal Supply Schedule solicitations:


1. Contract Payment Information (I-FSS-XXX) 

2. Single Payment Office (CP-FSS-XXX)

New Solicitation Clause


I-FSS-XXX (XXX 1994)


Contract Payment Information


a. The General Services Administration (GSA) will be the centralized billing/payment office for all purchases/invoices
issued against the schedule contracts. Paper invoices (with related purchase/delivery order copies) conforming
to the requirements of the Prompt Payment Clause (52.232-25) and the Invoice Requirements Clause (552.232-72)
should be submitted to either of the following mailing addresses:
1. For paper invoices (with related purchase/delivery order copies) containing prompt payment discounts: General
Services Administration, Office of Finance, P.O. Box 419399, Kansas City, MO 64141-6399.
2. For all other paper invoices (with related purchase/delivery order copies): General Services Administration,
Office of Finance, P.O. Box 419029, Kansas City, MO 64141-6029.
b. Inclusion of the Activity Address Code (AAC) and Fund code on all purchase/delivery orders is required before invoicing
GSA. EDI transactions must be submitted in accordance with Federal implementation conventions.
c. Contractors shall submit invoices and copies of the agencies' purchase/delivery orders either by Electronic
Data Interchange (EDI), or mail for non-/EDI transactions. Submission of invoices by EDI is preferred because it
is the most economic and efficient method for the contractor and the Government.
d. Agencies will submit purchase/delivery orders to contractors in an original and one copy. A copy of the customer
agency EDI or paper purchase/delivery order must accompany each initial invoice submitted to GSA for payment. In
the case of ongoing service arrangements like rental or leasing, this means the contractor must include a copy of the
purchase/delivery order for such arrangements with the initial EDI or paper invoice submitted for payment. It will
not be necessary to submit subsequent copies of the same order unless requested by GSA for a particular case.
e. Proper invoices will be paid within the prompt payment discount terms included in the contract or 30 day payment
cycle.
f. Electronic submissions must conform to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12 standard and the
Federal implementation conventions. Request for these conventions and questions regarding registration in the
Government Electronic Commerce system should be addressed to 1-800-EDI-3414. Registration is
done via your value added network and includes acceptance of the Government Trading Partner Agreement (TPA).
g. Initial invoices (both paper and EDI) cannot be processed for payment without submission of a copy of the corresponding
agency purchase/delivery order. Any data the ordering activity requests for inclusion on the invoice must be included
on the invoice sent to GSA. Include applicable Special Item Numbers (SIN's) and/or part numbers if not referenced
in the customer's order. Pursuant to the Prompt Payment Act, improper invoices will be returned to the contractor.

h. Ordering activities may purchase open market items on the same purchase/delivery order form used to order items
from the schedule contract if the acquisition is made at the lowest overall cost. The invoiced amount may include allowable
nonschedule items. (However, the invoiced amount for any nonschedule item will also be subject to a 1 percent charge
to the ordering agency.) 
i. All questions concerning invoices shall be addressed to the GSA Office of Finance (816) 926-7356. Questions
concerning purchase/delivery orders shall be directed to the agency placing the order. Questions regarding GSA
billings shall be directed to the GSA Office of Finance at (816) 926-7037. 
j. In order to facilitate processing of invoices, contractors are requested to include on the invoice the name and
phone number of a person to contract should questions arise regarding the invoice. 
k. The contractor's submission of an invoice constitutes a representation that the supplies have been delivered
to a post office, common carrier, or point of first receipt by the Government; and the contractor agrees to replace,
repair, or correct supplies not received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to the purchase/delivery
order. In the case of services, submission of the invoice means that required services have been satisfactorily performed.
GSA and the ordering activities reserve the right to require proof of shipment or evidence of delivery/performance
prior to payment. GSA, Office of Finance will implement a post payment satistically reliable system to validate agency
receipt of goods or services. 
l. Ordering activities will continue to resolve delivery and other performance problems concerning their schedule
orders directly with the contractors. When resolution of disputes remains unresolved, ordering activities may
charge back billings to GSA. GSA will offset claims from future payments to suppliers after notification. Disputes
will continue to be resolved by the applicable GSA Contracting officer. 
m. Pursuant to the clause, Examination of Records by GSA (552.215-70) and FAR, Subpart 4.7, contractors are
required to retain files, records, and information relevant to this contract, including records to support/confirm
shipments, deliveries, invoices, and to verify agencies' purchase/delivery orders, for up to 3 years after final
payment, or as specified in Subpart 4.705 through 4.705-3, whichever periods expire first. 


Cover Page Notice
Single Payment Office


The General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service is pleased to announce the establishment of a single
payment office for receipt and payment of schedule invoices. Invoices submitted for payment for all orders issued
under this Federal Supply Schedule will no longer be paid by the individual ordering activities. Instead, GSA will
be the single payment office for all invoices submitted against contracts under this schedule. This new single payment
procedure relieves contractors of the burden of invoicing numerous billing offices, resulting in a reduction in
administrative costs for contractors. See Clause I-FSS-    , Contract
Payment Information.

The following is a brief outline of the steps for paying and billing by the GSA Kansas City Finance Office:

1. Invoices with copies of purchase/delivery orders will be accepted by GSA either through Electronic Data Interchange
(EDI) or paper.

2. Proper invoices, with accompanying purchase/delivery orders will be entered into the Finance Information Network
(FINET) data base.

3. GSA will pay proper invoices (check or electronic fund transfer (EFT), at negotiated contract terms in accordance
with the Prompt Payment Act.

4. GSA will bill customer agencies for reimbursement. The amount billed will be the contractor's published schedule
price shown on the customer purchase/delivery order. The price published in the schedule pricelist is based on adjusting
the negotiated award price upward by 1 percent (of the awarded price.) This adjustment is accomplished by multiplying
the schedule contract price by 1.01. (See attached example).

5. Some data captured by GSA will be available to contractors and ordering activities via a bulletin board. such data
will include paying and billing data plus a scanned image of any paper invoice and order in the system. It will also facilitate
communication with the GSA Finance employees via electronic mail box or telephone for any other assistance needed.
Access to the system will require identification of the user by vendor Tax Identification Number (TIN), or ordering
activity paying office Activity Address Code (AAC), and a unique password.

6. Ordering offices will continue to resolve delivery problems directly with the contractors. When resolution of
disputes is not forthcoming, customers may charge back billings to GSA. GSA will offset claims from future payments
to suppliers after notification. Dispute will continue to be resolved by the applicable GSA contracting officers.



Example



The agency's purchase/delivery order reflected the adjusted schedule price. The contractor's invoice reflects
the negotiated award price.

Revised routine use.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11); 552a(r)), we are notifying the public of our intent
to alter an existing routine use of information maintained in four systems of records: The Claims Folder System, HHS/SSA/OP,
09-60-0089 (routine use number 24); the Earnings Recording and Self-Employment Income System, HHS/SSA/OSR,
09-60-0059 (routine use number 15); the Master Beneficiary Record, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09-60-0090
(routine use number 12); and the Master Files of Social Security Number (SSN) Holders and SSN Applications, HHS/SSA/OSR,
09-60-0058 (routine use number 19). The routine use in question presently contains identical text in
all four systems of records and the proposed modification is also identical in all four systems. A notice pertaining
to the Earnings Recording and Self-Employment Income System was last published in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 62407, December 5, 1994. A notice pertaining to the other three systems identified above was last published
in the 

Federal Register

 at 54 FR 52308, 52309 on October 17, 1994.



We invite public comments on this publication.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion



A. Background of the Proposed Routine Use



Over the past 15 years, the United States (U.S.) has established a network of bilateral Social Security agreements
that coordinate the U.S. retirement, survivors and disability insurance (RSDI) program with the comparable programs
of other countries. The agreements, commonly known in the U.S. as ``totalization'' agreements, are authorized by
section 233 of the Social Security Act. Currently, the U.S. has totalization agreements in force with 17 countries,
including Canada and virtually all of Western Europe.

One of the main purposes of the agreements is to help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their
careers between the U.S. and another country. Such workers may fail to qualify for Social Security benefits from one
or both countries because they have not worked long enough to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Under an agreement,
these workers may qualify for partial U.S. or foreign benefits based on ``totalized'' (i.e., combined) credits from
both countries.

Implementing the totalization agreements has required SSA to share certain personal information in its files with
counterpart social security agencies in the other countries. Generally, this sharing has been limited to personal
information needed to adjudicate claims for benefits under the agreements.

The present wording of the four routine uses permits disclosure of personal Social Security records for totalization
purposes, which, as discussed above, involves adjudication of claims. Consistent with section 233 of the Social
Security Act, the contemplated revision would expand the field of allowable disclosures by permitting disclosure
of personal information in SSA's files to a foreign Social Security agency essentially for all SSA and foreign program-related
activities in the U.S. or abroad. This will, in addition to the adjudication of claims, include those instances in
which SSA and a foreign country have entered into mutual assistance arrangements under a totalization agreement.
Under a mutual assistance arrangement, the foreign country would assist SSA generally in the administration of its
programs and SSA would provide reciprocal services for the foreign country. This would include post-entitlement
reviews and redeterminations, applications for Social Security numbers, program and operational studies, integrity
reviews and evaluations, research and statistical studies, and the like. It will also include situations where information
from SSA's records is needed by a foreign Social Security agency to implement a provision of an agreement other than
adjudicating a claim for benefits. For example, a foreign agency may need information from SSA's records to determine
if, under the provisions of an agreement, a person has the right to make voluntary contributions to its Social Security
system.

The proposed revised routine use provides for disclosure:

``To the Social Security agency of a foreign country, to carry out the purpose of an international Social Security
agreement entered into between the United States and the other country, pursuant to section 233 of the Social Security
Act.''

B. Compatibility of the Proposed Routine Use



The Privacy Act permits us to disclose information about individuals without their consent for a routine use, i.e.,
when the information will be used for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which we collected the information.
The proposed routine use, as modified, will be compatible with the purposes for which SSA initially collected the
information to be disclosed, since, by the nature of the totalization agreements the social security agency in the
other country will be administering a program comparable to the social security program of the U.S.; the totalization
agreements will continue to require that the foreign agencies use the information only for compatible, program-related
purposes. 



C. Effect of the Proposed Alteration on the Privacy of Individuals



Whenever the U.S. enters into a totalization agreement with a foreign country, SSA always requires the other country's
assurance that appropriate laws of that country protect the confidentiality of personal data. SSA always considers
how compatible the other country's privacy laws are with those of the U.S.

Unless the other country's laws allow disclosure, the information which SSA furnishes to a foreign country's social
security agency under a totalization agreement must be kept confidential and, to the extent possible, used exclusively
for implementing the agreement (Social Security Ruling 80-15 and 20 CFR 404.1930). 

SSA uses information in these four systems for the purposes of determining age and other evidentiary requirements
of individuals applying for Social Security benefits or Social Security numbers. We will continue to adhere to all
provisions of the Privacy Act, Social Security Act, and other applicable laws in our maintenance and use of the information.
Thus, we do not anticipate that any unwarranted effects on the privacy of individuals will result from the routine
use alteration proposed in this notice.

Notice of document availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a technical/agency
draft recovery plan: the second revision of the Florida manatee (

Trichechus manatus latirostris

) Recovery Plan.



The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background




Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort
the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery
Plans describe actions necessary for the conservation of the species, establish criteria for the recovery levels
for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice, and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comments period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

The Florida Manatee, a subspecies of the West Indian manatee, was originally listed under the Endangered Species
Act on March 11, 1967. The Service developed an initial recovery plan for manatees in 1980. The 1980 plan focused primarily,
but not exclusively, on manatees in Florida. In 1986 the Service adopted a separate Recovery Plan for manatees in Puerto
Rico. To reflect new information and planning needs for manatees in Florida, the Service revised the original plan
in 1989 focusing exclusively on Florida's manatees. The revised plan covered a five-year planning period ending
in Fiscal Year 1994. In view of progress since 1989 and planning needs beyond 1994, the Service is once again updating
and revising the plan.


West Indian manatees are also protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1461


et seq.

). This Act establishes the objective of continued maintenance of the health and stability of marine ecosystems,
and whenever consistent with this primary objective, obtaining and maintaining optimum sustainable populations
of marine mammals. It also establishes a moratorium, with certain exceptions, on harassing, hunting, capturing,
killing, or attempting to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal. Section 115(b) requires that conservation
plans be developed for marine mammals, including West Indian manatees, considered ``depleted'' under the Act. The
purpose of conservation plans is to identify actions needed to restore species or populations to optimum sustainable
population levels as defined under the Act. The revised recovery plan meets this planning requirement.

The Florida manatee is found primarily in coastal areas of Florida and southeast Georgia, although individuals range
seasonally westward into Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana on the Gulf coast and north through the Carolinas,
into Virginia and Chesapeake Bay along the east coast.

Manatees are large aquatic herbivores that feed opportunistically on a wide variety of submerged, floating, and
emergent vegetation in marine and freshwater habitats. This includes seagrasses, emergent vascular plants, benthic
algae, and various floating plants. Shallow grass beds with ready access to deep channels are preferred feeding areas.
Manatees frequent canals, creeks, embayments, and lagoons, particularly near the mouths of coastal rivers and sloughs,
for feeding, resting, cavorting, mating, and calving.

When ambient water temperatures drop below 20 
 C (68 
 F) in autumn and winter, manatees aggregate at natural or artificial warm water refuges or move to southern Florida.
Most artificial refuges are created by warm water outfalls at power plants or paper mills. Large winter aggregations
of 50 or more animals occur at these sites in central and southern Florida, and several smaller aggregations with 15
or fewer animals in northern Florida and southern Georgia on the east coast. The northernmost refuge used regularly
on the west coast is at Crystal River. Most manatees utilize the same warm water refuges each year. Some individuals
use different refuges from year to year while others use two or more refuges during the same winter.

During summer months, manatees may be found almost anywhere in Florida where water depths are greater than 1-2
meters. They normally occur alone or in pairs, although interacting groups of five to ten animals are not unusual (in
mating herd situations, for example).

Efforts have been made to develop a reliable estimate of manatee abundance in Florida. When conditions are favorable
a statewide aerial count of manatees at significant aggregation sites is conducted following winter cold fronts,
to assure the greatest likelihood that as many individual manatees as possible will be at these sites. The highest
single-day count of manatees from a statewide aerial survey is 1,856 animals in January 1992.

The long-term survival of manatees in Florida is uncertain. Known mortality, which averaged over 170 animals per
year between 1988 and 1992, is more than double what it was in the late 1970s. Because of current population size estimates
and the species' relatively low reproductive rate (manatees produce only a single calf every 2.5-5 years per
mature female), present mortality may exceed the populations' ability to produce new animals. The major threats
to Florida manatees are collisions with watercraft, which account for about 25 percent of known manatee deaths in
Florida annually, and destruction and degradation of habitat caused by widespread development throughout much
of the species' Florida range.

Data on manatee mortality in the Southeastern U.S. has been collected since 1974 and indicates a clear increase in
manatee deaths over the last 15 years. Although both natural and human-related causes are significant components
of manatee mortality, most of the increase in mortality can be attributed to increases in watercraft-related deaths
and perinatal deaths.

A prominent cause of natural mortality in some years in cold stress. Following a severe winter cold spell in 1989, 46
manatee carcasses whose death was attributed to cold stress were recovered. Significant mortality from exposure
to cold also occurred in the winters of 1977, 1981, and 1984.

The revised plan is based on recommendations of the Florida Manatee Recovery Team.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the revised recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Richard J. Smith (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit
pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned Permit Number PRT-787880.
The requested permit, which is for a period of 5 years, would authorize the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked
warbler (

Dendroica chrysoparia

). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction of a single family residence at Lot 37, Section 4, Block
D, Jester Point 2, Travis County, Texas. 



The Service has prepared an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take
application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made
before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the
Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``taking'' of endangered species such as the golden-cheeked warbler. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species incidental to,
and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at
50 CFR 17.22.


Richard J. Smith plans to construct a single family residence at Lot 37, Section 4, Block D, Jester Point 2 Subdivision,
Travis County, Texas. This action will eliminate one half acre of, and indirectly impact one additional acre of golden-cheeked
warbler habitat. The applicant proposes to compensate for this incidental take of golden-cheeked warbler habitat
by placing $2,000 into the City of Austin Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Fund to acquire/manage lands for the
conservation of the golden-cheeked warbler.
Alternatives to this action were rejected because selling or not developing the subject property with federally
listed species present was not economically feasible.

Controlled Substances: Established Revised 1994 Aggregate Production Quota 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice. 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a final revised aggregate production quota for 1994. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The interim notice (59 FR 54629, November 1, 1994) which established a revised 1994 aggregate production quota for
morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance, as required under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 826),
is adopted without change. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate
production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated
to the Administrator of the DEA pursuant to Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator,
in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994). 



On November 1, 1994, an interim notice establishing a revised 1994 aggregate production quota for morphine was published
in the Federal Register (59 FR 54629). All interested persons were invited to comment on or object to this proposed
aggregate production quota on or before December 1, 1994. No comments or objections were received. The interim notice
is adopted without change. 

The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual
aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international
treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers, their
impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has determined
that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 

Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
orders that the 1994 revised aggregate production quota for morphine, expressed in grams of anhydrous base, be established
as follows:

Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Kingstree, SC; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration 

 

On December 7, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published in the 

Federal Register

. 

 Investigation findings show decreased sales and production of gloves and tray products in the first six months of
1994 compared to the same period in 1993. 

 Findings on reconsideration, show increased company imports of gloves from Malaysia and tray products from Mexico
in 1994. 

 Other findings on reconsideration show that substantial workers separations occurred in 1994. 

 

Conclusion 

 

After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that Baxter Healthcare
Corporation workers in Kingstree, South Carolina were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like
or directly competitive with the surgical gloves and medical trays produced at Baxter Healthcare Corporation in
Kingstree, South Carolina. 

 ``All workers of Baxter Healthcare Corporation in Kingstree, South Carolina who became totally or partially separated
from employment on or after May 9, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade
Act of 1974.''

Investigations Regarding Certifications of Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance





Petitions have been filed with the Secretary of Labor under Section 221(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Act'') and
are identified in the Appendix to this notice. Upon receipt of these petitions, the Director of the Office of Trade
Adjustment Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, has instituted investigations pursuant to Section
221(a) of the Act.


The purpose of each of the investigations is to determine whether the workers are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Title II, Chapter 2, of the Act. The investigations will further relate, as appropriate, to the determination
of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.



The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing, provided such request is filed in writing with the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, at the address show below, not later than January 6, 1995.



Interested persons are invited to submit written comments regarding the subject matter of the investigations to
the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than January 6, 1995.



The petitions filed in this case are available for inspection at the Office of the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20210.

<DOCTITLE>Linmar Petroleum Company; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On November 13, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's
Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at
the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on November 3, 1994 and published in the Federal
Register

 on November 16, 1994 (59 FR 59253).

New findings show that Linmar operated crude oil drilling wells before it sold its operations to Coastal Oil and Gas
Corporation.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on August 11, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm engaged in employment related to the production of helicopters. 

The certification notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 25, 1994 (59 FR 43867). The certification was amended on October 3, 1994 to include leased workers from Rashkin,
C.D.I., I.T.S., E.T.S., P.D.S., Ciber and MDTS. 

At the request of the State Agency the Department is again amending the certification to include additional leased
workers engaged in the production of helicopters. The leased workers were from the Butler Service Group, Data-Tech,
Kirk-Meyer, Inc., and Tad Technical Services in Temple, Arizona; P.D.I. Corporation and Manpower Temporary Services
in Phoenix, Arizona and B & M Associates in Garden Grove, California.

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers at McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems (MDHS)
who were adversely affected by increased imports of helicopters. 

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,556 is hereby issued as follows: 

``All workers of McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems (MDHS) Mesa, Arizona and leased workers from Rashkin, C.D.I.,
Butler Service Group, Data-Tech, Kirk-Meyer, Inc., and Tad Technical Services in Tempe, Arizona; I.T.S. and E.T.S.,
Scottsdale, Arizona; P.D.S., Ciber, P.D.I. and Manpower Temporary Services in Phoenix, Arizona; MDTS in Long Beach
California and B & M Associates in Garden Grove, California, engaged in the production of helicopters at MDHS

<DOCTITLE>Philips Lighting; Richmond, KY; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



By applications dated November 21, 1994 and November 23, 1994, the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration
of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). The notice of negative determination was issued on
November 14, 1994 and will soon be published in the 

Federal Register

.

The petitioners claim that Philips Lighting is importing miniature and halogen lamps.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

<DOCTITLE>Weldotron Corporation; Piscataway, NJ; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On September 28, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. The notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 7, 1994 (59 FR 51211).

The company submitted additional information showing that it sells to dealers not end users and that it has lost market
share.

Investigation findings show declines in sales, production and employment in fiscal year (FY) 1994 compared to FY
1993.

Other investigation findings show that U.S. imports of packaging machinery increased absolutely and relative to
domestic shipments in 1993 compared to 1992 and in 1994 compared to 1993.

Other findings show that the workers were previously determined to be adversely impacted by imports and certified
under petition TA-W-26,423 which expired on November 25, 1993.

Findings on reconsideration show that Weldotron lost market share for its automatic sealer packaging machines to
imported automatic sealer packaging machines in 1994 compared to 1993.

Other findings on reconsideration show that several of the dealers surveyed indicated increased purchases of automatic
sealer machinery while reducing their purchases from Weldotron in the relevant periods.



Conclusion



After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the workers at Weldotron
Corporation in Piscataway, New Jersey were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly
competitive with the packaging equipment produced at Weldotron Corporation in Piscataway, New Jersey.

``All workers of Weldotron Corporation in Piscataway, New Jersey who became totally or partially separated from
employment on or after November 25, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade
Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Scab Rock Feeders, Incorporated; Othello, WA; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration </DOCTITLE>



On December 7, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance for former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published
in the 

Federal Register

. 

Investigation findings show that Scab Rock Feeders, Inc., ceased operations in August 1994, when all workers were
laid off. 

The workers were previously certified for trade adjustment assistance (TAA) on July 28, 1989 under petition TA-W-23,045
which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 22, 1989 (54 FR 34834). 

On reconsideration, it was found that the workers were negatively impacted by imported Canadian cattle. The Canadian
government subsidizes their cattle industry. 

New findings on reconsideration show that a major declining customer decreased its business with the subject firm
because of increased import purchases of Canadian cattle. 



Conclusion 



After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the workers at Scab
Rock Feeders, Othello, Washington were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive
with that produced at Scab Rock Feeders in Othello, Washington. 

In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following revised certification for the Scab Rock Feeders,
Inc., workers in Othello, Washington. 

``All workers of Scab Rock Feeders, Inc., Othello, Washington who became totally or partially separated from employment
on or after December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company; Haddam Neck Plant; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-61, issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO, the licensee), for operation
of the Haddam Neck Plant, located in Middlesex County, Connecticut.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of the Proposed Action



The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications (TS) 3.4.1.1, ``Reactor Coolant Loops and Coolant
Circular,'' TS 3.7.1.1., ``Safety Valves_Self Actuation Function,'' Table 3.7-1, ``Steam Line Safety Valves
Per Loop,'' and their associated Bases sections. In addition, the TS change will add a new TS 3.7.1.1.2, ``Safety Valves_Remote
Actuation Function,'' with an associated Bases change. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's
amendment request dated May 4, 1993, as supplemented August 9 and 18, 1993, January 25, April 11, and June 22, 1994.



The Need for the Proposed Action



By letter dated May 4, 1993, CYAPCO informed the staff that during the Cycle 17 refueling outage, four main steam safety
valves (MSSVs) (one per steam line) were replaced with valves that would provide remote manual operation. These valves
have dual capability, as MSSVs (self-actuating function) and as atmospheric dump valves (ADV) (remote-actuation
function). These valves will significantly increase the remote manual atmospheric steam dump capability of the
Haddam Neck Plant. To assure the remote manual operation of the new MSSVs, the licensee has proposed adding the remote
function of the MSSVs to the TS. The licensee is also removing the loop isolation valves from the TS. In addition, the
appropriate Bases sections will be modified to include a discussion of the remote actuation capability of the MSSVs
and remove the discussion regarding the use of the loop isolation valves for mitigation of a steam generator tube rupture
(SGTR) event.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The TS changes, hardware modifications, and the associated analysis will change the licensing basis for mitigating
a SGTR event at the Haddam Neck Plant. The new MSSVs can be operated remotely from the main control room, as well as locally
(self-actuating) for steam generator overpressure protection. This modification provides the plant the ability
to rapidly cool down and depressurize without reliance on the main condensor or other nonsafety-related balance
of plant equipment. The plant will now mitigate a SGTR event with the use of the MSSVs as remote ADV rather than the loop
isolation valves. The use of ADVs to limit break flow for a SGTR event is consistent with most other Westinghouse PWR
plants. The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed TS changes and concludes that the new MSSVs still
meet the original design (self-actuating function) and can also be used as atmospheric steam dump valves (remote-actuation
function). The proposed TS changes will provide assurance of the operability of both functions. The removal of the
loop isolation valves are acceptable because the licensee has demonstrated that SGTR events will now be mitigated
with the use of the MSSVs as ADVs rather than the loop isolation valves. The Updated Final Safety Analysis Report will
be revised to reflect the change in the licensing basis associated with the mitigation of a SGTR event.

The proposed TS change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in
the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual
or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed TS amendment.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment involves features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed amendment.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed amendment,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the amendment would be to deny the amendment request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Haddam Neck Plant.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the Connecticut State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed amendment.

For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated May 4, 1993, as supplemented
August 9, and 18, 1993, January 25, April 11, and June 22, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Company, et al.; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3; Receipt of Petition
for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that by petition dated November 14, 1994, Florida Energy Consultants, Inc. (FEC) and Linda
E. Mitchell (petitioners), in a petition signed by Mr. Thomas J. Saporito, Jr., request that they be granted (1) an
administrative public hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
(Board) and (2) leave to intervene in such a hearing. The petitioners also request that the NRC (3) issue a confirmatory
order requiring the Arizona Public Service Company, et al. (licensee) to immediately bring all three units at the
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station to 0 percent power until such time as the licensee can demonstrate corrective
actions obviating any inference of a hostile work environment and (4) issue a demand for information (DFI) to the licensee
seeking an explanation as to why the NRC can have confidence that the licensee will ensure that an environment exists
free of harassment, intimidation, and discrimination, both in general throughout its organization and in particular
with respect to certain named individuals. In addition, with respect to these individuals, the NRC interprets the
petition as also requesting that the NRC require the licensee to provide (5) a description of these individuals' current
employment duties and responsibilities, (6) an explanation as to why the NRC can have confidence that these individuals
will comply with NRC requirements, (7) information as to why the Commission should not take action to prohibit these
individuals from being involved in NRC-licensed activities, (8) information as to why the NRC should have reasonable
assurance that these individuals will abide by NRC regulations that protect individuals who engage in protected
activities, and (9) any other information the licensee believes to be relevant to the Commission's decision in this
matter.
The petitioners assert as a basis for their requests that the licensee has been the subject of numerous complaints
filed under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 and adjudicated by the Department of Labor under the employee protection
provisions found in 29 CFR part 24. In addition, the petitioners assert that a hostile work environment is pervasive
and encompasses all three units at Palo Verde, as well as being condoned and fostered by license management to dissuade
employees at Palo Verde from identifying safety concerns internally or directly to NRC representatives. The petitioners
also assert that they are subject to physical harm and the loss of personal property should Palo Verde experience a
nuclear accident as a direct or indirect result of the hostile work environment at this facility.

The petitioners' current requests are similar to those in a petition dated May 12, 1993, as supplemented on May 28,
1993, in which Mr. Saporito requested that the NRC institute a proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 to modify, suspend,
or revoke the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station operating licenses; initiate actions to immediately shut down
the three nuclear reactors at Palo Verde; take escalated enforcement action against the licensee and/or licensee
management personnel; and take immediate actions to cause an exhaustive survey of licensee employees at Palo Verde
to ascertain the scope and breadth of any chilling effect that may exist at the nuclear station and to discover if licensee
management actions, if any, were effective in limiting any chilling effect at the nuclear station. In addition, the
bases for the petitioners' current requests are similar to those in Mr. Saporito's request of May 12, 1993. Mr. Saporito
asserted as bases for his prior requests, in part, that the licensee had violated 10 CFR 50.7, ``Employee Protection'';
alleged that the licensee had a reputation for leading the nation in whistleblower complaints; pointed to the Department
of Labor discrimination cases involving licensee employees, Linda Mitchell and Sarah Thomas, and the resulting
issuance by the NRC of a notice of violation and proposed imposition of civil penalties on September 20, 1992; and asserted
continuing discrimination by the licensee against the petitioner in denying him employment at the Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station. Since the requests of May 12, 1993, and November 14, 1994, are similar, the staff is addressing
the current petition together with the petition of May 12, 1993, as supplemented, for purposes of preparing a director's
decision. The petition has been referred to the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206. As provided
by Section 2.206, appropriate action will be taken with regard to the specific issues raised by the petition in a reasonable
time.

Copies of the petition are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and local public document room at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix,
Arizona 85004.

<DOCTITLE>Rosemount Nuclear Instruments, Incorporated; Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>


The Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, has taken action with respect to two related Petitions filed
by Paul M. Blanch. Notice is hereby given that by letter dated December 31, 1992, Mr. Blanch requested that the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (Commission) impose immediate enforcement action against Rosemount Nuclear Instruments,
Incorporated for a knowing and intentional failure to submit, as required by 10 CFR Part 21, a notice to the Commission
that ``basic components supplied'' to its customers ``contained defects,'' as defined by 10 CFR  21.3. In a
second letter dated March 28, 1994, the Petitioner requested the Commission to inform all users of Rosemount 1150-series
pressure transmitters and trip units of ``significant safety problems'' identified in Commission Inspection Report
99900271/93-01, and that the Commission take ``prompt and vigorous'' enforcement action against Rosemount
for careless disregard of the reporting requirements of 10 CFR Part 21.
The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) has granted these Petitions in part and denied them
in part. The reasons for the Director's actions are set forth in the ``Director's Decision under 10 CFR  2.206''
(DD-94-12), which is available for public inspection in the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120

Appendix A to This Document_Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206


I. Introduction


On December 31, 1992, Mr. Paul M. Blanch (the Petitioner) filed a Petition with the Executive Director for Operations,
pursuant to Section 2.206 of Title 10 of the 

Code of Federal Regulations

 (10 CFR 2.206), in which he requested that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) impose immediate enforcement
action against Rosemount for a knowing and intentional failure to submit, as required by 10 CFR Part 21, a notice to
the Commission that ``basic components supplied'' to its customers ``contained defects,'' as defined by 10 CFR 21.3.
On March 2, 1993, the Petitioner sent a letter to the NRC in which he stated, in part, that he ``was requesting enforcement
action against Rosemount for failing to report defects as required by 10 CFR 21,'' and making ``a simple request that
[the NRC] investigate a potential cover-up and a failure to report a defect in accordance with the requirements of
10 CFR 21.'' On March 28, 1994, the Petitioner filed a second Petition in which he requested that the NRC inform all users
of Rosemount 1150-series pressure transmitters and series 510 and 710 DU trip devices of ``significant safety problems''
identified in NRC Inspection Report 99900271/93-01 (which addressed principally the NRC staff inspection
of Rosemount's 10 CFR Part 21 and Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 50 established programs), and that the NRC take ``prompt and
vigorous'' enforcement action against Rosemount for careless disregard of the reporting requirements of 10 CFR
Part 21. In a letter dated May 2, 1994, the Petitioner reiterated his request that the NRC take action to inform all users
of Rosemount 1150-series pressure transmitters and series 510 and 710 DU trip devices of the ``significant safety
problems'' identified in NRC Inspection Report 99900271/93-01,
By letters dated February 2 and April 7, 1993, in response to the Petition of December 31, 1992, and letter of March 2,
1993, the NRC staff stated that the request for immediate action was denied because the actions it had already taken
to address the problems with Rosemount transmitters were sufficient to ensure that the problems did not constitute
an immediate safety concern for any nuclear power plant. The NRC staff also stated in those letters that, as provided
by 10 CFR 2.206, action would be taken on the Petition within reasonable time. By letters dated April 25 and June 3, 1994,
in response to the Petitioner's letters of March 28 and May 2, 1994, the NRC staff stated that the NRC inspection report
was included in the April 1994 publication of NUREG-0040,
 ``which is sent to all nuclear power plant licensees,''
 and that none of the identified issues were considered significant enough to warrant immediate notification of the
nuclear industry.





In regard to the Petitioner's second request,``to take prompt and vigorous enforcement action against Rosemount
for careless disregard of 10 CFR Part 21 requirements,'' the Petitioner was informed in the April 25, 1994, letter,
that ``[t]he NRC will make its determination as to enforcement action, [against Rosemount] should such enforcement
action be warranted, following the enforcement conference.''
The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) has granted these Petitions in part. Specifically,
pursuant to the ``General Statement of Policy and Procedure for NRC Enforcement Actions'' (Enforcement Policy),
10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C, a Severity Level II notice of violation was issued to Rosemount on November 15, 1994. On the
basis of the conclusions and findings in NRC Office of Investigations (OI) Investigation Report 4-90-009,
dated November 12, 1993, in NRC Inspection Report 99900271/93-01, and NRC staff deliberations on a Rosemount
presentation of its relevant information regarding the Rosemount pressure transmitter sensor cell oil-loss problem
during the enforcement conference on June 23, 1994, the NRC staff concluded that Rosemount acted in careless disregard
of 10 CFR Part 21 requirements and its own procedures by failing to adequately evaluate or to inform its customers of
the potential for degraded transmitter operation as a result of the oil-loss problem.

Additionally, on October 11, 1994, the NRC staff received an unsolicited letter from Rosemount, dated September
28, 1994. In this letter, Rosemount stated that it agreed with the NRC ``views'' expressed at the June 23, 1994, enforcement
conference on the importance of 10 CFR Part 21. However, Rosemount stated that it could not concur in the view that Rosemount
acted in careless disregard of NRC requirements by failing to adequately identify and report potential defects in
its Model 1153 pressure transmitters prior to December 1988. Rosemount attached a 40 page enclosure to its letter
that takes exception to a number of statements and conclusions delineated in the NRC inspection report. These exceptions
included Rosemount's position that early (1984) transmitter failure mechanisms were never established as resulting
from oil loss, and the oil loss problem could have resulted from other factors unrelated to transmitter design. Rosemount
additionally disagreed with the position in the inspection report that early non-nuclear grade Model 1151 transmitter
failures should have made Rosemount aware of a potentially generic problem affecting its nuclear grade transmitters.
 Further, Rosemount disagreed with the portion of the inspection report that identifies the time that Rosemount began
to track field returns of failed transmitters.





The staff reviewed the information in the Rosemount letter and determined that the letter did not provide new information
or arguments that would cause any change in the staff's position. The inspection report and the OI investigation identified
numerous instances where problems with transmitters implicating the transmitter design, manufacturing or test
processes were brought to Rosemount's attention but were not properly addressed by Rosemount for their generic or
common-mode failure implications. The staff concluded that Rosemount failed to address these generic or common-mode
failure implications, initially because it improperly dispositioned the failures as random rather than using available
information to identify deviations that clearly, in the staff's view, represented a common mode failure potential.
Despite having, as the OI investigation identified multiple examples of transmitter failures and several members
of the Rosemount staff convinced that the failures were a result of manufacturing problems common to all the transmitter
sensor cells, Rosemount failed to inform NRC licensees of the deviation.
 The staff concluded that Rosemount's knowledge of this deviation, coupled with its failure to inform licensees,
constituted careless disregard for the requirements of 10 CFR Part 21.





II. Background



Since the mid-1980s, the NRC staff had been aware of several potential problems with Rosemount Models 1152, 1153,
and 1154 transmitters (1150-series transmitters). In 1987, the NRC conducted an inspection at Rosemount because
of a potential generic problem concerning degraded transmitter operation associated with contaminants in sensor
cell oil, a condition referred to as ``latch-up'' identified in the early 1980s. During the same period that Rosemount
was trying to resolve the latch-up problem, another sensor cell related problem was identified that also caused degraded
transmitter operation. The second problem involved transmitter sensor cell oil-loss, which was not readily detectable
because the sensor cell was sealed inside the transmitter. Rosemount pressure transmitter sensor cell oil-loss
problems in nuclear applications occurred in a number of instances and at varying frequencies from 1984 on, indicating
a potential generic problem with the transmitters. Rosemount nevertheless treated each licensee or Rosemount-identified
oil-loss problem as an isolated occurrence, and handled the problems essentially on an individual basis as they arose.
Although Rosemount indicated to the NRC staff and licensees that the failures resulting from oil loss appeared to
be random and unrelated to any generic problem with Rosemount 1150-series transmitters, the staff nevertheless
issued NRC Information Notice 89-42, ``

Failure of Rosemount Models 1153 and 1154 Transmitters,''

 on April 21, 1989, to alert licensees to this potentially generic problem. On May 10, 1989, Rosemount issued the first
of four technical bulletins in which it discussed loss of oil in its pressure transmitters. The NRC staff continued
to monitor the oil-loss problem and discuss the potentially generic problem with Rosemount and the industry.

The NRC staff remained concerned that the transmitter oil-loss problem did not appear to be isolated, as Rosemount
had been informing licensees. Therefore, on March 9, 1990, it issued Bulletin 90-01, 

``Loss of Fill-Oil in Transmitters Manufactured by Rosemount,''

 to ensure that all licensees were adequately informed about the problem and would take appropriate corrective action.
After obtaining additional information, the staff issued 

Supplement 1 to Bulletin 90-01

 on December 22, 1992.

In February and March 1993, NRC staff performed an inspection at Rosemount. On March 4, 1994, the staff issued Inspection
Report 99900271/93-01, in which it identified an apparent violation of 10 CFR Part 21 regarding the transmitted
oil-loss problem and asked Rosemount to participate in an enforcement conference on the matter. In the report, the
staff also identified several other violations of 10 CFR Part 21 and several nonconformances regarding Appendix
B to 10 CFR Part 50. On June 23, 1994, an enforcement conference was held at NRC headquarters in Rockville, Maryland.

III. Discussion



On the basis of the evidence developed during the investigation, OI determined that two allegations were partially
substantiated. Regarding the first partially substantiated allegation, OI determined that Rosemount presented
incomplete and inaccurate information to the NRC during a public meeting on April 13, 1989. However, the evidence
developed during OI's investigation did not substantiate that this presentation of incomplete and inaccurate information
was deliberate. Although the NRC staff recognized that the inaccurate and incomplete statements made to the NRC during
the public meeting on April 13, 1989, were not deliberate, it had substantial concerns about this matter and emphasized
to Rosemount in the letter of November 15, 1994, that the submittal of inaccurate or incomplete information to the
NRC is unacceptable and that the NRC expects all licensee and vendor communications to be complete and accurate and
to properly reflect situations that could have implications for public health and safety.

Regarding the second partially substantiated allegation, OI determined that Rosemount acted with careless disregard
when, in violation of 10 CFR Part 21, it failed to adequately identify and report a deviation regarding sensor cell
oil-loss that was known to Rosemount staff and to inform its customers of the problem.

This violation was of concern because Rosemount did not fulfill its basic 10 CFR 21.21 responsibility of ``informing
the licensee or purchaser of the [transmitter oil-loss] deviation in order that the licensee or purchaser may cause
the deviation to be evaluated unless the deviation has been corrected.'' Rosemount was aware that its manufacturing
processes and testing were causing and allowing slow leaking sensor cells to be used in nuclear transmitters, but
Rosemount did not apprise NRC licensees of those circumstances. Although the different causes of the oil-loss problem
were known to the Rosemount staff, that information was not accurately or completely transmitted to individual licensees
for their use in performing an evaluation pursuant to Part 21. As a result, the licensee Part 21 evaluations that were
performed with the information which was provided to them by Rosemount did not encompass all of the known circumstances
surrounding the oil-loss problem. The objective evidence indicated that Rosemount field service staff became concerned
after the discovery of several transmitters with degraded operation that exhibited oil-loss at one NRC-licensed
facility in 1984. Additional instances of oil-loss in the nuclear transmitters continued to be documented by Rosemount
between 1984 and 1988. It appeared to the NRC staff that Rosemount's emphasis was on correcting the manufacturing
and testing weaknesses which allowed degraded transmitter operation due to oil-loss without much consideration
of candidly informing NRC licensees of the potential for degraded operation of Rosemount transmitters installed
in safety-related applications at NRC licensed operating nuclear power plants. Between 1984 and 1988, Rosemount
received many of the failed units from its nuclear customers, performed failure analyses, and determined that the
degraded operation of these units was caused from sensor cell oil-loss. Despite these numerous indications of potential
problems with the Rosemount Models 1152, 1153 and 1154 transmitters, Rosemount failed to comply with 10 CFR Part 21
requirements and its own internal policy and procedure and inform its customers of the potential problem in a timely
fashion. The NRC inspectors concluded, partly on the basis of Rosemount internal memoranda, discussions with past
and present Rosemount staff and correspondence between Rosemount and licensees, that weaknesses in Rosemount's
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, quality assurance (QA) program and the reluctance of Rosemount managers to be candid in
their communications with customers contributed to Rosemount's failure to promptly inform customers of the oil-loss
problem. If Rosemount had established effective measures to ensure that conditions adverse to quality, such as failures,
malfunctions, deficiencies, deviations and nonconformances, were promptly identified and corrected, Rosemount
management could have seen the developing trend of degraded transmitter response caused by inadequate or inconsistent
controls over the sensor cell manufacturing process. Rosemount did not begin to inform its nuclear power plant customers,
as required by 10 CFR Part 21 and its own procedures, of the deviation regarding the oil-loss problem until December
1988. The NRC staff believes that Rosemount's failure to take action between 1984 and 1988_as a result of its failure
to avail itself of the multiple opportunities to recognize the generic implications of sensor cell oil-loss in its
1150-series transmitters, repeated failure to recognize the problems identified by experienced Rosemount personnel,
and the reluctance of Rosemount personnel to allow candid communications with customers of the circumstances surrounding
the deviations_reflects careless disregard of the requirements of 10 CFR Part 21.

In summary, the NRC staff concluded that the failure of Rosemount to provide timely and complete notification of NRC
licensees in the more than four years that the company was aware, or should have been aware, of the problem indicates
a careless disregard of the reporting requirements of 10 CFR Part 21. In accordance with the Enforcement Policy, Supplement
VII, Section C.5, the failure either to perform an adequate Part 21 review or to inform Rosemount customers about the
problem would be classified as a Severity Level III violation. However, in accordance with Section IV.C of the Enforcement
Policy, the severity level was increased to Severity Level II because of the careless disregard of 10 CFR Part 21 by
the Rosemount nuclear department management between 1984 and 1988. No civil penalty was proposed because the staff
had not found that the requirements of 10 CFR 21.61 for issuance of a civil penalty_that a director or other responsible
officer knowingly and consciously failed to provide the notice required by 10 CFR 21.21_have been met in this case.



IV. Conclusions



The Petitioner's requests were granted, in part, and denied, in part, as discussed herein. As provided in 10 CFR 2.206(c),
a copy of this Decision will be filed with the Secretary of the Commission for the Commission's review.

<DOCTITLE>Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation; (Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1); Exemption</DOCTITLE>


I


Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NMPC or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR-63,
which authorizes operation of Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 (the facility or NMP1), at a steady-state
reactor power level not in excess of 1850 megawatts thermal. The facility is a boiling water reactor located at the
licensee's site in Oswego County, New York. The license provides among other things, that it is subject to all rules,
regulations, and Orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC) now or hereafter in effect.


II


Section III.D.1.(a) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires the performance of three Type A containment leakage rate
tests, at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period of the primary containment. The third
test of each set shall be conducted when the plant is shutdown for the 10-year inservice inspection of the primary containment.


III


By letter dated August 26, 1994, NMPC requested temporary relief from the requirement to perform a set of three Type
A tests at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period of the primary containment. The requested
exemption would permit a one-time extension of the second 10-year service period of approximately 24 months (from
the 1995 refueling outage, currently scheduled to begin in February 1995, to the 1997 refueling outage). The requested
temporary relief would permit the third test of the containment's second 10-year inservice inspection period to
correspond with the end of the current American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME
Code) inservice inspection interval.


IV


Section III.D.1.(a) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 states that a set of three Type A leakage rate tests shall be performed
at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period.
The requirement to perform a set of three Type A leakage rate tests at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year
containment service period provides assurance that the containment is leak tight. Type A leakage rate tests were
performed as required by Appendix J during the first 10-year containment service period (1974-1984). The second
10-year containment service period is scheduled to end in December 1994.
Due to a lengthy outage for the replacement of reactor recirculation piping, the first ASME Code required Inservice
Inspection (ISI) 10-year interval was extended to June 1986. An extended refueling outage (January 1987 to July 1990)
resulted in the second 10-year ISI interval being extended to December 1998. These extensions were made in accordance
with the provisions of Section XI of the ASME Code and have resulted in the ISI intervals being decoupled from the Type
A leakage test intervals since Appendix J does not contain any provisions for adjusting the 10-year intervals as does
the ASME Code for extended outages.
Two Type A tests have already been performed (May 1990 and April 1993) during the second 10-year containment service
interval. Since this second interval is scheduled to end in December 1994, the third test would be required during
the next refueling outage (February 1995). However, in an attempt to recouple the schedule for the Type A tests with
the ISI schedule and to avoid performing an additional Type A test, the license has proposed to extend the third Type
A test of the second interval until the 1997 refueling outage and to perform the final tests of the second ISI interval
at that time. This action would eliminate the need to perform an extra Type A test which could otherwise be required
(one test in 1995 and another in 1997) while recoupling the Type A test schedule with the ISI schedule.


V


The Commission has determined that pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(1) this exemption is authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. The Commission
further determines that special circumstances, as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), are present justifying the
exemption; namely, that application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve
the underlying purpose of the rule. The underlying purpose of Section III.D.1.(a) of the Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50
is to provide an interval short enough to prevent serious deterioration from occurring between tests and long enough
to permit testing to be performed during regular plant outages.
The last Type A test was performed in April 1993. Performance of another Type A test in February 1995 would result in
a test interval of only 22 months. Whereas if the 10-year interval was equally divided into three intervals, each test
interval would be 40 months. Delaying the next Type A test until the 1997 refueling outage would result in a test interval
of approximately 46 months since NMP1 is currently operating on a 24-month fuel cycle. The 46-month test interval
would be consistent with the NRC staff's current position (as reflected in the NRC's Standard Technical Specifications)
that Type A test intervals should be 40 

#

 10 months. Furthermore, the licensee has presented the following information which gives a high degree of confidence
that the containment will not degrade to an unacceptable extent while this exemption is in effect:
1. The two most recent Type A test data show that the ``as left'' leakage rates (0.463% wt/day and 0.4634% wt/day, respectively)
were well within the acceptance limit of 0.75 Lt (0.892% wt/day).
2. There have been no permanent or temporary modifications to the containment structure, liner, or penetrations
since the last Type A test that could adversely affect the Type A test results.
3. No modifications that require a Type A test are planned prior to the 1997 refueling outage.
4. There have been no pressure or temperature excursions in the containment which could have adversely affected containment
integrity.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting this Exemption will not have a significant impact
on the environment (59 FR 62752).
This Exemption is effective upon issuance and shall expire at the completion of the 1997 refueling outage.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc., National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
and New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Rule Changes Relating to the Exchanges' and Association's
Rules Regarding Shareholder Voting Rights


December 19, 1994.



I. Introduction



On June 2, August 5 and 10, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), and the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''), respectively,
 submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 proposed rule changes that would amend their rules governing the voting rights of shareholders of common stock listed
on the NYSE or Amex, or in the case of the NASD, included in the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation (``Nasdaq'') System, in order to establish a minimum voting rights policy (``Policy'').







In addition, on July 11, 1994, and August 8, 1994, the NYSE filed with the Commission Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, to its proposed
rule change. Amendment No. 1 modifies the NYSE provision regarding the issuance of non-voting stock and is discussed
in more detail below.
 Amendment No. 2 is largely technical, and resulted in minor changes in the text of its new rule.






The proposed rule changes were published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34518 (August 11, 1994),
59 FR 42614 (August 18, 1994) (``Proposing Release'').


II. Background


In 1988, the Commission adopted Rule 19c-4, the Shareholder Disenfranchisement Rule, in response to concerns
that had been raised regarding the practice by some companies of restricting the voting rights of existing shareholders
through the issuance of shares with multiple, low or no voting rights.
 Generally, Rule 19c-4 prohibited self regulatory organizations (``SROs'') from listing on an exchange or
quoting on an interdealer quotation system an issuer's securities if the issuer had issued securities or taken other
corporate action that had the effect of nullifying, restricting, or disparately reducing the voting rights of existing
common shareholders. Rule 19c-4 also specified certain transactions that were deemed non-disenfranchising
to existing shareholders. In 1990, in 

Business Roundtable 

v. 

SEC,

 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the Commission's rule on grounds that the basis on which the Commission
had adopted the rule was beyond the scope of the Commission's regulatory authority.
 The court, however, did not address other statutory provisions on which the Commission had not relied, but that might
provide a basis for promulgating similar regulation.







Since 

Business Roundtable,

 market participants, the Commission, and Congress have encouraged the exchanges and the NASD to formulate their
own listing standards regarding shareholder voting rights. Most recently, Commission Chairman Levitt encouraged
establishment of a minimum voting rights policy. The NYSE, NASD, and Amex have developed such a Policy and now seek
Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. Although based upon the similar in many respects to former
SEC Rule 19c-4, the Policy is more flexible and seeks to accommodate shareholder protection concerns with the
needs and changing circumstances of capital markets and issuers.

III. Description



A. The Policy



The SROs are proposing to adopt a minimum voting rights rule that would prohibit continued listing on the NYSE or Amex,
or inclusion in the Nasdaq System, of companies that disenfranchise shareholders of public common stock.
 The proposed rule states that:







Voting rights of existing shareholders of publicly traded common stock registered under Section 12 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 cannot be disparately reduced or restricted through any corporate action or issuance of stock.
Examples of such corporate action or issuance include, but are not limited to, the adoption of time-phased voting
plans, the adoption of capped voting rights plans, the issuance of super voting stock, or the issuance of stock with
voting rights less than the per share voting rights of the common stock through an exchange offer.





The Policy also contains additional guidelines as well as extensive interpretive language to supplement and clarify
the application of the Policy to, among other things, (1) issuers with existing dual class structures; (2) review
of past voting rights activities; and (3) foreign issuers.

The Policy specifies that the restriction against the issuance of super voting stock is primarily intended to apply
to the issuance of a new class of super voting stock. Companies with existing dual class capital structures generally
will be permitted to issue additional shares of a class of existing super voting stock consistent with the Policy.




In addition, under the Policy, the SROs will continue to permit corporate actions or issuances that would have been
permitted under former Rule 19c-4. In evaluating other forms of actions or issuances, the SROs will consider,
among other things, the economics of the transaction and the voting rights being granted. The SROs intend to be flexible
in their interpretations under the Policy.

Further, the Policy encourages issuers to consult with their respective SROs prior to engaging in any action or committing
to take any action that may be inconsistent with the Policy. While the Policy will continue to permit actions previously
permitted under former Rule 19c-4, issuers are urged not to assume, without first discussing the matter with
their respective SRO staff, that a particular issuance of common or preferred stock or the taking of some other corporate
action necessarily will be consistent with the Policy. The SROs also suggest that copies of preliminary proxy or other
material concerning matters subject to the Policy be furnished to the appropriate SRO for review prior to formal filing.

Additionaly, the Policy provides for a review procedure for companies that apply to list on the NYSE or Amex, or to be
included in the Nasdaq System. Under the procedure, the applicable SRO will review the issuer's past voting rights
actions to determine whether another SRO has (1) found any of the issuer's actions to have been a violation or evasion
of that SRO's voting rights policy, or (2) been approached by the issuer for a ruling or interpretation regarding the
application of that SRO's voting rights policy with respect to a proposed transaction. Based on the above, the SRO
may take any action it findings appropriate in assessing the issuer's listing application.
 Moreover, it will consider any such prior interpretations issued by other SROs in response to any request by the issuer
on the same or similar transaction in making its own determination.





Finally, the Policy exempts issuances or actions by non-U.S. companies. Specifically, the SROs will accept any action
or issuance relating to the voting rights structure of a foreign company that is either (1) in compliance with the SRO's
requirements for domestic companies, or (2) not prohibited by the company's home country law. This is consistent
with past SRO action acknowledging the need for separate treatment of foreign issuers under their qualitative listing
standards.

B. Interpretation of the Policy: Presumptively Permitted Transactions



Former Rule 19c-4 enumerated certain corporate actions that presumptively were not disenfranchising, but
nevertheless affected shareholder voting rights.
 Actions presumptively permitted under former Rule 19c-4 will continue to be presumptively permitted under
the Policy. In addition to these specific provisions of former Rule 19c-4, in the release adopting Rule 19c-4
the Commission specified that the rule would not apply in certain circumstances. As discussed below, these actions
also will be permitted under the Policy.





1. Initial Public Offerings



Under the Policy, companies can issue dual classes of stock with unequal voting rights in an initial public offering
and thereafter issue additional shares of those classes.
 In this regard, the issuance of disparate voting rights stock pursuant to an IPO is not a disenfranchising action because
there are no existing public shareholders that are being affected by the transaction. For example, a company could
offer Class 

A

, lower voting stock, and Class 

B

, higher voting stock, to the public in an initial public offering. Under the Policy, additional issuances of Class


B

, super voting stock, could be issued in the future because the dual class structure resulted from the IPO. The issuances
could be made without additional issuances of Class 

A

 stock. In contrast, if a company offers only Class 

A

 stock to the public in an initial public offering it could not subsequently issue a new Class 

B

 super voting stock.





2. Lower Voting Stock



Under the Policy, a company that already has gone public may issue a new class of lower voting rights stock.
 Although former Rule 19c-4 permitted new lower vote issuances, the Policy will provide an issuer with additional
flexibility to issue ``regular vote'' stock following the issuance of lower voting stock. Specifically, the Policy
will permit such issuances because shareholders purchasing a new issue of lower voting stock are fully aware of the
limits on their voting power, both individually and collectively, at the time of purchase. Similarly, existing shareholders
of lower voting stock are cognizant of the possibility that their voting power may decrease through subsequent issuances
of regular or lower voting stock. By restricting subsequent offerings to equal or lesser voting stock,
 no existing individual or class of shareholder is disenfranchised by this form of capitalization. Thus, under the
Policy, an issuer may continue to issue new classes of lower voting stock (

e.g.

, stock with 1/2 vote per share followed by 1/4 vote per share, and so on).






The Policy, however, will clearly prohibit the issuance of a new class of stock with voting rights greater than the
outstanding existing classes. For example, a company with a one vote class and 1/2 vote class could not later issue
a new class of super voting stock with votes higher than the one vote class. There are certain limited situations, however,
where a company with multiple classes may be able to issue a new class of stock with voting rights higher than one of the
existing classes. For example, a company with classes of one vote and 1/4 vote stock outstanding may be able to issue
a new class with 1/2 vote stock even if it was not part of its original capital structure. The SROs should analyze such
issuances on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the information disclosed to shareholders in the creation
of the existing outstanding classes, the purposes and economics of the issuance of the new class of stock, and the disenfranchising
effect on each outstanding class.

Notwithstanding the above, there are certain issuances of lower voting stock that would clearly violate the Policy
because they are constructed in a manner to disenfranchise shareholders. For example, if a company issued lower voting
stock with a divided sweetener in exchange for stock of an outstanding class with higher votes but lower dividends,
this exchange offering would be violative of the Policy. Thus, the SROs will review issuances of new classes of lower
voting stock to determine if they are consistent with the Policy.

3. Bona Fide Mergers and Acquisitions



The issuance of lower voting rights stock in connection with a business combination to effect a bona fide merger or
acquisition, in which the voting rights of the securities issued would not be greater than the voting rights of any
existing class of common stock, will be presumed to be accepted under the Policy. For example, when the lower voting
rights stock is structured so that dividends or other substantive rights (

e.g.

, election of directors) are based on the assets or performance of the acquired company, such a recapitalization generally
should be considered bona fide and consistent with the purposes of the Policy.






4. Application of the Policy to Control Share Acquisition Statutes and Other Takeover Defenses



The Policy will not apply to corporate action taken pursuant to state law requiring a state's domestic corporation
to condition the voting rights of a beneficial or record holder of a specified threshold percentage of the corporation's
voting stock on the approval of the corporation's independent shareholders. These statutes generally are referred
to as state ``control share acquisition statutes.'' They are designed to prevent unwanted acquisitions of the corporations
by limiting the voting rights of large shareholders, unless specifically approved by the disinterested shareholders
or unless the corporation amends its articles of incorporation or by-laws to opt out of the statute.

In addition, the Policy will continue to permit issuers to take corporate action pursuant to other shareholder rights
plans such as ``poison pills''
 and ``lock-ups.''
 Shareholder rights plans usually are adopted by corporations to discourage tender offers, or to encourage the development
of an auction for the company resulting in shareholders receiving a higher price for their stock. They are not adopted
to disenfranchise an existing class or classes of shareholders.







Similarly, lock-up options or agreements generally are utilized by a corporation as a defensive tactic and entered
into with a friendly potential acquirer often referred to as a ``white knight.'' Nevertheless, lock-up effected
by the sale of a new class of super voting preferred stock generally would be prohibited under the Policy because they
would involve an issuance of a new class of super voting stock. Accordingly, the SROs will have the flexibility to analyze
the facts of each lock-up option or poison pill on a case-by-case basis for consistency with the Policy.







C. Interpretation of the Policy: Other Issues



1. Prior Interpretations



Following the initial adoption of former Rule 19c-4, the SROs issued a number of policy interpretations regarding
corporate actions that they believed were permitted under the rule. These interpretations will continue to apply
under the Policy with respect to the specific corporations for which the interpretations were issued. In addition,
they will be available as guidance to other corporations seeking authorization, from the SRO that issued the interpretation,
to engage in similar corporate activity. With respect to the specific company for which the interpretation was issued,
this provision is a reassurance that its action will not be re-evaluated under the Policy. With respect to other corporations
seeking to implement similar transactions, this provision grants the interpretation some precedential value to
be used when discussing the potential transaction with the SRO.



2. Adoption of New Voting Rights Structures



In certain circumstances, the Policy also will provide greater flexibility than Rule 19c-4 for companies initially
adopting a new voting rights structure or altering their existing capital structure in such a fashion that might otherwise
be prohibited under the Policy. For example, if a company is in financial distress, the company might issue preferred
stock with heightened voting protection necessary to protect the interests of the preferred stock purchasers. The
SROs will evaluate the application of the Policy to such transactions on a case-by-case basis. In other situations,
issuances of preferred stock that have special voting rights attached would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to
determine if they are consistent with the Policy. In this regard, traditional varieties of preferred stock would
be permitted under the Policy. In contrast, blank-check preferred stock with unlimited voting rights generally
would be viewed as creating a new class of super voting rights and impermissible under the Policy.

<TEXT>
 

3. Issuers With Existing Dual Class Structures


A number of companies currently have multiple class structures. In addition, after the approval of the Policy, additional
companies may adopt multiple class structures consistent with the Policy. For example, a company could have a dual
class structure that it implemented prior to adoption of the Policy, or could have a permissible dual class structure
resulting from an initial public offering or the issuance of lower voting stock. Under former Rule 19c-4, such
a company generally was prohibited from issuing additional amounts of the higher voting stock unless such issuance
did not further disenfranchise existing shareholders. In effect, a company's existing dual class capital structure
was permitted only as to securities previously issued that were then outstanding in the market.
Under the Policy, there will be no restrictions on the ability of a dual class company to issue additional shares of
an existing class of higher voting stock in a capital-raising transaction, via a stock dividend, through the issuance
of stock options, or in a stock split. Such a company would not be permitted, however, to adopt a different capital structure
that reduces or restricts voting rights, such as a time-phased voting plan, or the issuance of a third class of stock
with greater voting rights than shares of any existing class.


4. Grandfather Provision


Under the Policy, the SROs will ``grandfather'' all companies listed on the NYSE or Amex or included in the Nasdaq System
that have taken action inconsistent with the Policy prior to its approval by the Commission.
 This will cover NYSE, Amex, or Nasdaq companies that either have (1) issued securities that would have violated the
new Policy, or (2) taken all corporate action necessary to authorize such an issuance. Such corporate action includes
the required shareholder approval as mandated by the state of incorporation, the corporation's by-laws or articles
of incorporation, or the home market. In addition, as noted above, contrary to former Rule 19c-4, which grandfathered
only existing securities, the Policy will in effect grandfather a company's dual class capital structure in its entirety.
 Finally, the NYSE proposal also specifically states that it will grandfather all NYSE companies that have taken action
inconsistent with former Rule 19c-4 since that rule was vacated.







D. Implementation of the Policy


1. Interaction With Other Markets


SRO interpretations under the Policy will be flexible, recognizing that both the capital markets and the circumstances
and needs of listed and Nasdaq issuers change over time. At the same time, the Policy will give the SROs broad discretion
in reviewing past voting rights actions by companies seeking to list on the Exchanges, or qualify for inclusion in
the Nasdaq System. Subject to the foregoing, the SROs will apply the following procedures in providing interpretations
under the Policy:
 An issuer seeking to list its securities on an Exchange, or qualify for inclusion in the Nasdaq System, may seek
advice from the respective SRO with respect to a proposed transaction. In such a case, the SRO would not provide advice
under the Policy if the issuer already had sought and received advice from its home market on the transaction. In that
instance, the SRO would honor the home market's interpretation.
 If an SRO delists or deregisters an issuer's securities for violation of the Policy, the other SROs would not
subsequently list or include in Nasdaq the issuer's securities.
 The SROs will publish their interpretations under the Policy.
These procedures essentially ensure that each SRO will have primary jurisdiction to provide advice to issuers in
its own market.


2. SRO Review of Past Issuances


The SROs will have flexibility in reviewing the circumstances of the original issuance of any class of stock, including
non-voting stock, in determining whether to list such stock or permit its inclusion in the Nasdaq System. For example,
if a company issues stock shortly before seeking to list or qualify for inclusion, and such an issuance would have been
a violation of the Policy had the issuer been listed on the Exchange or included in the Nasdaq System, the Exchanges
generally would not list the stock and the NASD would not include the stock in the Nasdaq System. Similarly, if the issuer
voluntarily delisted from an Exchange or withdrew from the Nasdaq System in order to effect such an issuance, the SROs
also generally would not list the stock or include it in the Nasdaq System.
There are other situations, however, in which such a prior issuance would not necessarily be a bar to listing on the
Exchanges or inclusion in the Nasdaq System. For example, a company whose stock is traded over-the-counter but not
included in the Nasdaq System, such as on the NASD's Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, might effect such an issuance
well before the issuer contemplated listing on an Exchange or seeking to be qualified for inclusion in the Nasdaq System.
Under certain circumstances, it may be appropriate for the SRO to permit the listing or inclusion of such stock. To
maintain necessary flexibility, this area will be left open to the SROs for application to the particular facts and
circumstances of each case.

IV. Summary of Comments


The Commission received two comment letters regarding the proposed uniform voting rights policy: one in favor of
the Policy
 and one against the Policy because it was not sufficiently restrictive.
 In addition to generally supporting the Policy and favoring the flexibility accorded to SROs in interpreting the
new Policy, the ABA letter urges regular, periodic, fully informed, and generally consistent interpretations by
the SROs. Further, it favors prompt publication of any meaningful distinctions in interpretation by the SROs. The
HFRRF letter principally opposes the ability under the Policy for corporations with dual class structures to an unlimited
right to issue additional shares of super voting stock. The HFRRF letter believes this aspect of the Policy will permit
further disenfranchisement of lower vote shareholders. It recommended that the SROs adopt certain structural safeguards
for those limited instances where multiple capitalization is permitted.







In addition, the NYSE previously solicited comments on an earlier version of the proposed rule change before it submitted
the proposal to its board of directors. The NYSE received 93 letters supporting, 39 opposing, and 14 taking a neutral
position towards the Policy.
 According to the NYSE, the negative comment letters generally opposed the proposal for the following reasons: The
NYSE does not have jurisdiction in this area; the Policy is too restrictive and should permit any shareholder voting
policy that shareholders ratify; the Policy is too flexible and the NYSE should revert to a strict ``one-share, one-vote''
standard; and the Policy lacked specificity, thus not providing sufficient guidance as to what voting rights structures
the Policy would permit. The letters in favor of the Policy supported its adoption primarily for the following reasons:
the Policy protects the interests of shareholders; the Policy allows issuers responsible flexibility in the issuance
of lower voting stock; the Policy provides greater certainty in the U.S. capital markets; the Policy provides publicly
traded companies flexibility with respect to formulating their capital structures; and the Policy and its application
will result in uniformity among the markets, while providing the SROs needed flexibility in certain circumstances
to conduct a case-by-case analysis. The NYSE circulated a revised draft to various of its advisory committees to address
some of these concerns and received 12 written comments_eight in support, four offering various technical suggestions.




Finally, the Commission notes that several commenters to the NYSE draft proposal expressed concern that it could
conflict with the 

Business Roundtable

 decision, although no commenters raised this concern directly to the Commission. The Commission believes such concerns
are misplaced. Each of the three SROs is adopting the Policy into its own rules, whereas former Rule 19c-4 was
adopted by the Commission. The 

Business Roundtable

 court merely rejected the basis offered by the Commission in adopting the Rule pursuant to Section 19(c) of the Act,
holding that the Commission's justification had exceeded its statutory authority thereunder. Although the substance
of former Rule 19c-4 is similar to the Policy, this has no bearing on the validity of SRO action taken pursuant
to Section 19(b) of the Act. In fact, the court in the 

Business Roundtable

 decision specifically noted that exchanges and securities associations have the authority to propose rules, including
listing standards, pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act, even through in its opinion the Commission may not itself
impose similar rules under Section 19(c) of the Act.

V. Discussion



The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities association and national securities exchanges
and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 6 and 15A of the Act. Specifically, the Commission believes that,
consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act, the Policy does not unfairly discriminate among issuers
and will foster investor confidence in the markets thereby protecting investors and the public interest. In addition,
the Commission believes that the Policy and the procedures for its implementation further the maintenance of a fair
and orderly market. Finally, for the reasons set forth below, the Commission finds that, consistent with Sections
6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9) of the Act, the proposal does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the Act.




A. Shareholder Protection and the Public Interest



The Commission believes that the issue of shareholder voting rights has far-reaching implications for shareholder
protection and the public interest, and that an SRO rule ensuring a minimum level of shareholder protection from disenfranchising
actions is appropriate and consistent with the Act. More specifically, it is reasonable for the SROs, in providing
a market to trade securities, to ensure that shareholders in that market are treated fairly. Widespread occurrences
of shareholder disenfranchisement could undermine investor confidence in the market and diminish investor participation.
As discussed below, the Policy, which was independently proposed by the NYSE, Amex, and NASD, and which will operate
through their respective listing standards, is drafted to provide public shareholders as much protection as possible
from disenfranchisement, while minimizing intrusion into traditional areas of state regulation and not unduly
interfering with the ability of public corporations to set their own capital structures.

The Commission believes that the minimum standard for voting rights contained in the Policy will help prevent abusive
disenfranchisement of public shareholders and provide guidance to issuers that either currently have other than
a standard one-share, one-vote capital structure or that are contemplating a capital reorganization that may come
under the scrutiny of the Policy. The SROs have identified as narrowly as possible those corporate actions or issuances
that would disenfranchise shareholder voting rights.

For example, as discussed above, the new Policy is similar, in part, to former Rule 19c-4, which was designed
to discourage issuers from engaging in activity involving corporate issuances or other corporate actions that nullified,
restricted, or disparately reduced the voting rights of existing shareholders of common stock and would continue
to permit transactions permitted under that standard. Based on the SROs' experience in applying former Rule 19c-4,
and in light of feedback they have received from various groups, the SROs have designed the Policy to be more flexible
than Rule 19c-4, especially in addressing certain business or economic situations which would warrant a corporation
to issue disparate voting rights stock.

As a result, the Policy, in addition to permitting transactions that had been permitted under former Rule 19c-4,
generally will permit corporate actions or issuances that are consistent with the corporation's existing capital
structure in addition to allowing the SROs more flexibility in evaluating new issuances on a case-by-case basis.
The Commission believes that by assuring the continued permissibility of those corporate actions permitted under
former Rule 19c-4 release and under the interpretations issued pursuant to that rule, the SROs have provided
consistency for issuers.
 On the other hand, the Commission believes that the Policy will provide the SROs useful flexibility in evaluating
transactions on a case-by-case basis and permitting issuers to adopt certain new voting rights structures consistent
with the Policy.

<PARENT> FR941227-2-00087 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, the Commission believes that the SROs' decision to ``grandfather'' the capital structure
 of all listed (or qualified for inclusion in the Nasdaq System) companies that have taken action inconsistent with
the new Policy is reasonable and, for the reasons discussed herein, consistent with the purposes of the Act. First,
the Commission believes that it would be unduly burdensome upon issuers to require them to go back in time and unwind
transactions in order to come into compliance with the Policy. Second, the Commission believes that the Policy is
a forward looking proposal to prevent disenfranchising transactions and that it would not be equitable to force issuers
to try to undo transactions previously effected. Finally, the Commission believes that the grandfather provision
of the Policy is necessary to avoid unfair discrimination between issuers, in that issuers will not be required to
change their capital structures in order to come into compliance with rules to which they were not subject when creating
such a capital structure.




B. Statutory Requirements Applicable to Securities Exchanges and Associations


As noted above, the Commission has reviewed the proposed rule changes to ensure that they ``are not designed to permit
unfair discrimination between * * * issuers'' pursuant to Sections 6(b)(5) and 15(A)(6) of the Act
and ``do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of [the Act]''
pursuant to Sections 6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9).
 In addition, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are appropriate in the public interest, and necessary
for the protection of investors. For several reasons, the Commission believes that the Policy fulfills these requirements.




First, the Policy is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among issuers. As noted above, the Policy will be
applicable to all Section 12 registered securities listed or quoted on the respective markets. On Nasdaq this includes
both Nasdaq NMS and Nasdq Small Cap companies and on Amex this includes EM listed companies. In addition, although
an issuer participating in a violative transaction may no longer be listed on any of the three markets, this is not the
result of unfair discrimination. The nature of a listing or eligibility requirements is to set standards with which
all issuers must comply in order to have ready access to the market. Indeed, the Act recognizes that U.S. securities
markets will develop their own eligibility standards for securities traded on their markets and duelist those companies
which do not comply. Thus, the Commission believes that the adoption of the Policy as a listing or eligibility standard
for the respective Eros does not unfairly discriminate among issuers and thus is consistent with the provisions of
Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act.
Second, the Commission believes that the Policy will enhance the ability of the Exchanges and the NASA to fulfill their
responsibilities under Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act. In particular, the Commission believes that the
Policy is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practice, and to promote just and equitable principles
of trade. Moreover, the Policy is designed to protect investors and the public interest.
 As discussed above, the Policy protects investors from disparate voting rights plans that result in disenfranchisement,
which eliminates a shareholder's right to have any effect on future corporate decisions through transactions that
are not fully subject to market discipline. At the same time, however, the Policy is crafted to permit disparate voting
rights plans that do not disenfranchise existing shareholders and assure that the creation of shares with lesser
voting rights are subject to market discipline. This avoids unduly rights are subject to market discipline. This
avoids unduly burdening issuers and allows for flexibility in devising a corporation's capital structure.




Third, the Commission also believes the Policy will not pose an inappropriate burden on competition among markets
because the Policy only sets a minimum threshold standard common to all three SROs. Each SRO is free to adopt a stricter
standard in competing for listings, if it chooses to do so. Further, the Policy still permits the SROs to compete for
listings based upon a variety of other factors such as the quality of their markets, services offered, and fees charged.
Finally, in regard to competition among issuers, the Policy only restricts issuers to the extent that they act to disenfranchise
shareholders but allows them to adopt a panopoly of non-disenfranchising structures.

<TEXT>
 

C. Implementation Provisions and Commission Oversight



As discussed above, the SROs intend to adopt consistent procedures on providing advice under the Policy to prevent
inconsistent interpretations that might invite abuse. In this regard, the SROs intend to publish their respective
interpretations and honor each other's interpretations, with the home market having primary jurisdiction over
transactions proposed by its issuers. Generally, if the NYSE or AMEX delist or the NASD deregisters an issuer's securities
for violation of the Policy, the issuer will not be accepted subsequently for listing on the NYSE or Amex or qualify
for inclusion in the Nasdaq System. In addition, during a new listing application process, each SRO will review past
corporate action regarding voting rights, including action undertaken shortly prior to applying for listing or
inclusion, in an attempt to flag such activity entered into solely in order to circumvent the Policy.






The Commission believes that these consistent interpretative procedures are necessary to prevent degradation
of the Policy and provide consistency and predictability for issuers.
 The SROs would not be able to proffer issuers an open, flexible voting rights standard and at the same time retain a meaningful
voting rights Policy if they were open to unlimited issuer pressure to eviscerate the Policy. The SROs recognize that,
with the implementation provisions, there is less likelihood that issuer pressure could create a ``loophole'' that
will defeat the purpose of the Policy of each SRO. The Commission agrees that the SROs' action is necessary here to prevent
abuse.





Further, without the implementation procedures, the erosion of the minimum standard, with the consequent occurrences
of shareholder disenfranchisement, could reduce investor confidence and participation in these markets. On the
other hand, consistent interpretation of the Policy will increase investor confidence in the quality and reliability
of the securities traded in these markets. Thus, the provisions of the Policy regarding implementation and interaction
with other markets, including the proposed procedures to honor interpretations under the Policy, are an integral
and necessary means of assuring meaningful implementation of the Policy.

In addition, the Commission's extensive oversight over the enforcement of all SRO rules, including listing standards,
will help to ensure that the Policy is not implemented in an anticompetitive or discriminatory manner. For example,
the Commission inspects SROs for, among other things, compliance with SRO rules, and is authorized to bring enforcement
action against an SRO for failure to comply with its own rules (including listing standards).
 Accordingly, any action by an SRO to apply and enforce the Policy unfairly or in an anticompetitive manner could subject
the SRO to an enforcement action by the Commission.





Finally, the Commission's authority in approving delistings and in reviewing appeals by issuers whose securities
are delisted from an Exchange or terminated from inclusion in the Nasdaq System should further ensure fair application
of the Policy. For example, before a security can be delisted by an Exchange under Section 12 of the Act, the Commission
must enter an order granting the application to delist,
 and may order a hearing to determine whether such application has been made in accordance with the rules of the Exchange.
 Moreover, under Section 19(d)(2) of the Act, the Commission is authorized to review any SRO action that prohibits
or limits any person in respect to access to services offered by the SRO.
 In summary, the Commission's pervasive oversight over the implementation of SRO listing standards, in addition
to the right of any issuer delisted, terminated from quotation, or denied listing as a result of an interpretation
under the Policy to have the action reviewed by the Commission, will help to ensure that the Policy will not be implemented
in an anti-competitive or discriminatory manner.

VI. Conclusion





The Commission believes that the NYSE's, Amex's, and NASD's proposals to adopt the Policy as set forth above is an important
step toward increasing shareholder protection, thereby enhancing investor confidence in the U.S. securities markets.
The Commission continues to encourage the adoption of such standards by the remaining SROs, and remains confident
that such a voting rights listing standard is a beneficial step toward strengthing the U.S. securities markets.




The Commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Sections 6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9)
 of the Act, which provide that an SRO's rules must not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Commission recognizes that, under the Policy, issuers with capital
structures that do not conform to the requirements of the Policy will not be permitted to list or include their securities
on three major U.S. markets. Nevertheless, the Commission is persuaded by the SROs' stated objectives_to enhance
investor protections
; and to provide investors with the protections the Policy affords and the benefit of knowing that issuers cannot avoid
the effects of a market's voting rights policy by seeking an interpretation in another market
_that the Policy and procedures for interpretations under the Policy do not place an undue burden on competition and
that any burden on competition that may result from the Policy is appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the
Act.










Similarly, as discussed in this order, the Commission believes the proposed rule changes do not violate Sections
6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act,
 which provide, among other things, that the rules of an SRO may not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between
issuers, among others.






For the reasons stated above, as well as the analysis contained in this order, the Commission believes that the protections
afforded shareholders by the adoption of SRO proposals that will prohibit certain disparate voting rights plans
that disenfranchise existing shareholders is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder pertaining to a national securities association and to national securities exchanges.



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule changes (SR-NYSE-94-20, SR-Amex-94-29, and SR-NASD-94-95)
are approved.



By the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Boston Stock Exchange, Inc; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change and
Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to the
Boston-Montreal Linkage</DOCTITLE>



December 19, 1994.



I. Introduction



On February 7, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to establish a northbound trading linkage with the Montreal Exchange (``ME''). On November
7, 1994, the BSE submitted amendment no. 1 to the rule filing.








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34456 (July 28, 1994), 59
FR 39802 (August 4, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.



II. Background 



In 1984, the Commission approved the first phase of a southbound linkage between the BSE and the ME for the routing of
orders for the purchase and sale of securities listed on the BSE.
 The initial phase of the linkage permitted ME members to direct to the BSE marketable limit orders in approximately
forty U.S.-listed Canadian national stocks available for trading on the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
In 1985, phase two of the linkage was approved permitting the BSE to expand the list of securities eligible to be traded
on the linkage to include most ITS securities traded on the BSE.







In 1989, the Commission approved a Linkage Plan that allowed the BSE to connect the southbound linkage with the BSE's
automated communications order-routing network (``BEACON'') system.
 The Commission also approved at that time a generic linkage rule that allows the Exchange to establish trading linkages,
provided that the BSE submits a Linkage Plan for each new proposed linkage to the Commission for its approval.







III. Description of the Proposal



The proposed rule change establishes a trading linkage for the transmission of orders in certain Canadian securities
from the BSE to the ME (``northbound linkage''). The linkage will be administered pursuant to the Linkage Plan agreement
between the BSE and ME. The Linkage Plan contains provisions relating to management of the linkage, resolution of
trade disputes, comparison and settlement of trades, and surveillance of transactions.






As a result of the northbound linkage, BSE members will be able to route orders for dually traded Canadian securities
 directly to the ME for execution. The broker-dealers may enter orders for Canadian securities into their in-house
electronic systems, which are linked to the BSE's BEACON system. BEACON receives and records the details of each order
 before routing them directly to the ME's automated order-routing and execution system.
 The ME system then logs each order and directs it to the ME specialist's electronic book.

<TEXT>
 


Upon the execution of a U.S. customer's order on the ME, a customer report is sent from the ME specialist's book through
the ME system to the BEACON system, with both systems logging in the details of the report. BEACON then sends the report
to the U.S. broker-dealer's in-house system. The trades are cleared in Canada pursuant to the BSE member's agreement
with a Canadian correspondent to clear and settle trades at the Canadian Depository for Securities (``CDS'') on its
behalf.
 





IV. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5), which requires that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.





The Commission generally views agreements between the United States and foreign securities exchanges as positive
developments that reflect and contribute to the increasing internationalization of the world's securities markets.
 Linkages, in particular, facilitate the flow of capital and financial services across borders. Currently, when
a BSE member has customer orders for Canadian securities to be traded on the ME, it must make arrangements with a Canadian
broker-dealer (ME member) to place the orders on the ME for execution. The linkage proposed by the BSE will establish
an order routing mechanism for the transmission of orders from BSE members to the ME involving Canadian securities
traded on the ME and also registered under Section 12(b) of the Act. As a result, the linkage should improve the efficient
handling of such orders routed by BSE members on behalf of their customers to the ME.





The Commission notes that the northbound linkage is not intended to create a single market or to ``link'' the BSE and
ME marketmaking functions for dually listed securities.
 Although the northbound trading linkage uses the BSE's BEACON system to communicate orders to the ME, trading between
the ME and BSE specialists will not be coordinated, nor will a BSE specialist be allowed to interact with U.S. customer
orders entered by broker-dealers into the northbound linkage for routing to the ME. Nevertheless, agency duties
will require BSE members to route orders to the market that will provide the best execution.
 Accordingly, customers should not be disadvantaged by a BSE member's decision to route their orders to a particular
market.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission has reviewed the Linkage Plan for the northbound linkage between the BSE and ME to ensure that it will
provide U.S. investors with protection against fraudulent and manipulative acts. The Commission believes that
a surveillance sharing agreement between markets proposing to develop linkages for order routing purposes is an
essential element to any Linkage Plan. Such agreements ensure the quality of information necessary to detect or deter
potential manipulation and other trading abuses. In this regard, the BSE is a member and the ME is an affiliate members
of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), which provides for the exchange of necessary surveillance information.
ISG coordinates surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets.
 The Commission believes that this structure should enhance the level of cooperation between the BSE and ME surveillance
departments with regard to transactions executed through the northbound linkage. 




In addition, the Commission notes that each northbound trade will be entered into the ME's electronic book, and will
therefore be subject to the ME's on-line stock trading monitoring system (``SECMA'').
 Furthermore, the BSE and ME have developed a trade execution monitoring program for the surveillance of orders directed
to the ME from the BSE's BEACON system. These surveillance procedures should also help to detect as well as deter any
potential manipulation. 




In summary, the Commission believes that the BSE has set forth a reasonable proposal. In particular, by limiting the
northbound linkage to securities that are traded on the BSE and registered under Section 12(b) of the Act, the linkage
will provide customers with access to executions on the ME, while ensuring that such customers continue to receive
the protection of the federal securities laws and the rules thereunder. 
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication
of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 restricts the securities that may be traded through the northbound linkage
to securities that are registered under Section 12(b) of the Act
 and therefore limits the scope of the rule change as originally proposed. The broader proposed rule change was published
in the 

Federal Register

 for the full statutory period and no comments were received.
 






V. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning amendment No. 1. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the BSE. All submssions should refer to File No. SR-BSE-94-01
and should be submitted by January 17, 1995. 



VI. Conclusion 



It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-BSE-94-01) is approved. 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; the Midwest Securities Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Proposed Rule Change Deferring Its Next Annual Meeting</DOCTITLE>



December 19, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on November 4, 1994, the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSTC-94-15) as
described in Items I and II below, which items have been prepared primarily by MSTC. The Commission is publishing this
notice and order to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons and to grant accelerated
approval of the proposed rule change.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



MSTC proposes to defer its next annual meeting until the regularly scheduled meeting in April 1995.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Commission recently approved certain changes to MSTC's Rules and By-laws relating to the election of MSTC's Board
of Directors.
 MSTC's 1994 annual meeting was originally postponed because of the pending rule filing. Pursuant to the Commission's
order approving the filing, the size of the MSTC Board was expanded to thirty-one, the same size as the Board of its parent,
the Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX''). The filing also amended MSTC's By-laws to make the members of the MSTC Board
and nominating committee the same as those of the CHX.





The CHX/MSTC nominating committee imminently will be commencing deliberations for its slate of candidate for the
1995 annual meetings, of CHX, MCC, and MSTC to be held in April 1995. Because of this, MSTC and its shareholder CHX do
not believe that it is in the best interests of MSTC to have a 1994 annual meeting in such close proximity to the 1995 annual
meeting. To do so will not only make the nominating committee's work extremely difficult (

i.e.,

 preparing for two meetings at once) but also could confuse participants of MSTC. Thus the purpose of the proposal is
to avoid the confusion and burden of holding a 1994 annual meeting within a few months of the scheduled date of the 1995
annual meeting.

The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17(A)(b)(3)(F) of the Act in that it fosters cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements on Burden on Competition.



MSTC believes that no burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



MSTC neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of the clearing agency foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
 The proposal to not hold the 1994 annual meeting so close to the regularly scheduled 1995 annual meeting should avoid
confusion among the participants arising from having to consider two director elections within a few months. (

I.e., 

directors elected in 1994 would only serve for the few months prior to the 1995 election held during the 1995 Board meeting.)
In addition, the limited term of a few months for a Board elected at this time could create confusion for participants.





The proposal to not hold the 1994 annual meeting also should avoid the financial burden of holding two annual meetings
within such a short period of time. The Commission agrees with MSTC that the burden and costs of holding a 1994 annual
meeting at this time would be greatly in excess of its usefulness.

Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires that the rules of the clearing agency assure fair representation of its shareholders
and participant in the selection of its directors.
 Because the current Board was elected pursuant to MSTC rules designed to assure such fair representation, the Commission
believes that retaining the current Board for a few additional months until the successor Board can be elected in an
orderly fashion is consistent with the fair representation requirements under the Act.




MSTC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule because in order to hold their 1995 annual meeting in April, MSTC must begin preparations now.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings also will be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of MSTC. All submissions should refer to the File No. SR-MSTC-94-15
and should be submitted by January 17, 1995.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSTC-94-15)
is hereby approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of Proposed Rule Change Making Technical Modifications to Procedures Relating to the Consolidated Trade Summary</DOCTITLE>



December 19, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on November 16, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



NSCC proposes to amend language in NSCC's Procedures to conform with recent changes regarding NSCC's Consolidated
Trade Summary.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The primary purpose of the proposed rule change is to change all references to the Continuous Net Settlement (``CNS'')
and Non-CNS Compared Trade Summaries contained in NSCC's Procedures Section II(D), governing the Trade Comparison
Service for debt securities, Section II(E), governing the Trade Comparison Service for when-issued securities,
and Section V(C), governing net balance orders, to references to the Consolidated Trade Summary. The proposed rule
is necessary because such changes were inadvertently omitted from NSCC's recently approved rule change regarding
the Consolidated Trade Summary.

The proposed rule corrects and conforms NSCC's procedures regarding the Consolidated Trade Summary. The proposed
rule change, therefore, is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act
 and the rules and regulations thereunder because it will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions.





(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact on or impose a burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



NSCC has not solicited or received comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19 (b)(3)(A)(i)
 of the Act and pursuant to Rule 19b-4(e)(1)
 promulgated thereunder because the proposal constitutes a stated policy or interpretation with respect to the meaning
or administration of an existing rule. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change does not adversely affect
the rights of persons using the services of NSCC. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such rule change, the
Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes
of the Act.






IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of NSCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NSCC-94-20
and should be submitted by January 17, 1995.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Providing for the Execution of Cross Transactions on the PSE Equities Floor</DOCTITLE>


December 19, 1994.


On August 18, 1994 the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')

1

 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,

2

 a proposed rule change to facilitate the execution of large agency cross transactions on the Exchange equities floors.
On October 13, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 1.

3








The proposed rule change, as amended, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34849 (October
18, 1994), 59 FR 53695 (October 25, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
The proposed rule change adopts Commentary .05 to PSE Rule 5.14(b), which governs the execution of stock cross transactions,
to facilitate the execution of large agency crosses. The proposed Commentary is designed to permit the execution
of ``clean'' agency crosses of 25,000 shares or more at or within the prevailing quotation without regard to the priority
of existing bids or offers where both the buy and sell orders are for accounts other than that of a member or member organization
or non-member broker dealer. The proposal, however, would allow the cross to be broken up at a price that is better than
the proposed cross price for one side or the other, but in doing so the member must satisfy all other existing bids and
offers at that price.
The Commission notes that similar rules are in place at the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'')

4

 and at the American Stock Exchange (``Amex'')

5

. The NYSE and Amex rules, like the PSE proposal, restrict clean crosses to agency orders, of 25,000 shares or more,
and permit such crosses to be broken up only if price improvement will result therefrom and all other bids and offers
at that price are satisfied.





The clean cross proposal should facilitate the ability of PSE members to execute block agency cross transactions
on the PSE by giving such orders priority over orders at or within the prevailing quotation. At the same time, the proposal
preserves the auction market principle of price improvement by permitting the cross transaction to be broken up at
a better price. The proposal also preserves the principle of priority by requiring that a member who breaks up a cross
by providing a better price must first satisfy all existing market interest having priority at that better price before
trading with any part of the cross.
The Commission recognizes that approval of the clean cross proposal could disadvantage orders on the book, or in the
trading crowd, at the same price as the cross transaction. This is the only aspect of the proposal that really represents
a departure from existing auction market principles. Thus, under the proposal, a clean cross could be executed while
a public investor's limit order on the book remains unexecuted. For example, if a public customer left a limit order
on the specialist's book at 10 a.m., bidding for 500 shares of XYZ at 40, a so-called clean cross could be executed at
10:10 at a price of 40 without satisfying the public customer order.
As previously noted in the approval of the NYSE and Amex proposal, the Commission still believes that a preferable
approach would be to establish a means of intermarket price protection for all limit orders in all market centers.
However, with no means of intermarket price protection for public limit order, and given Commission approval of the
NYSE's and Amex's identical clean cross proposals, as well as other regional exchange proposals designed to minimize
interference with cross transactions, it could be unfair to preclude the PSE from adapting to the present competitive
environment by facilitating the execution of agency block cross transactions on the Exchange. Thus, the Commission
believes that it is not unreasonable or inconsistent with the Act for the PSE to react to competitive pressures for
block business by permitting large agency crosses to occur at or within the bid or offer price. In this regard, the proposed
rule change should further competition among exchanges and other competing market centers and increase opportunities
for the more efficient execution of block-sized agency cross transactions.
The Commission believes that the proposal restricts sufficiently the circumstances in which members may execute
clean cross transactions on the Exchange. In particular, the Commission believes that the share size threshold of
25,000 shares or more should help to ensure that the clean cross proposal will apply primarily to large block-sized
orders where the depth of the prevailing bid or offer may be less likely to satisfy either side of the clean cross. In
addition, because the proposal is limited to agency orders only, the proposal should assist public customers in effecting
cross transactions on the Exchange and should not give any special advantage to members, member organizations, and
non-member broker dealers in their proprietary trading.
In summary, the Commission believes that the clean cross proposal should allow the Exchange to compete with other
exchanges for block-sized orders more fairly while upholding the auction market principle of price improvement.
In this context, while the proposed Commentary allows market interest of any size to break up a cross transaction,
the Commentary also requires that a member breaking up a cross must provide a better price than the cross price to one
side of the cross and he or she must satisfy in their entirety any bids or offers that have priority at that better price
before taking any part of the cross.

For the above reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with
the requirements of Sections 6(b) and 11A.
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public; the Section 6(b)(8) requirement that the rules of an exchange
do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act; and the Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii)
mandate for fair competition among exchange markets.




It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PSE-94-22) is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Depository Trust Company and Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia;
Order Approving Proposed Rule Changes to Amend By-Laws Regarding the Composition of the Respective Boards of Directors
and Nominating Committees</DOCTITLE>



December 19, 1994.



On July 12, 1994, the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (``PHILADEP'') and the Stock Clearing Corporation of
Philadelphia (``SCCP'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') proposed rule changes
(File Nos. SR-PHILADEP-94-01 and SR-SCCP-94-03) under Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 to amend their By-Laws governing the composition of their boards of directors and their nominating committees. On
July 14, 1994, PHILADEP and SCCP amended their respective rule filings.
 Notice of the proposals was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 4, 1994.
 No comment letters were received regarding the proposed rule changes. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission
is approving the proposed rule changes.







I. Description



PHILADEP and SCCP are amending Article IV, Section 2 of their respective By-Laws to remove the requirement that the
two vice chairmen of the board of governors of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'') serve as ex-officio
members of their boards of directors. The amendments install the chief operating officer of the PHLX both as an ex-officio
member of both of the boards of directors and also as the vice chairman of the boards. The amendments reduce the requisite
number of PHLX governors who must serve on the PHILADEP and SCCP boards of directors from a majority of the fifteen to
seventeen directors to six of the directors. The amendments also change the term of office for the boards of directors
to synchronize the term of office for the chairman of the PHLX's board of governors with his terms of office on the PHILADEP
and SCCP boards. 

PHILADEP and SCCP also are amending Article III, Section 4(a) of their By-Laws which currently require that each nominating
committee consist of five ex-officio members of the board of directors and two other persons appointed by the chairman
of the board. Under the amended rules, each nominating committee will consist of four ex-officio members of the board
of directors and three other persons appointed by the chairman of the boards.

The PHILADEP and SCCP Boards of Directors will continue to provide the PHLX, as the sole shareholder of both PHILADEP
and SCCP, with adequate representation. The PHLX will be represented by both senior exchange staff personnel and
by members of the PHLX board of governors, who typically also represent PHILADEP and SCCP participant firms. In accordance
with PHILADEP's and SCCP's amendment processes delineated in By-Law Article XI, the Chairman of the PHLX board of
governors, as agent for the sole shareholder and parent corporation, has signed a unanimous consent in lieu of a special
meeting to effectuate the foregoing changes. 



II. Discussion



The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Section 17A of the Act and specifically
with Section 17A(b)(3)(C).
 Section 17A(b)(3)(C) requires that a clearing agency assure fair representation of its shareholders or members
and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. As stated above, the proposed
rule changes provide the PHLX with continued fair and adequate representation in its capacity as the sole shareholder
of both PHILADEP and SCCP. The proposed rule changes also afford fair representation to the participants by continuing
to require their representation on the boards of directors and nominating committees of both PHILADEP and SCCP. 





III. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements
of the Act, and in particular with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.




It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-PHILADEP-94-01
and SCCP-94-03) be, and hereby are, approved. 




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>PaineWebber Incorporated; Temporary Order and Notice of Application for Permanent Order</DOCTITLE>



December 19, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary order and notice of application for permanent order of exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940
(the ``Act'').





APPLICANT:

 PaineWebber Incorporated (``PaineWebber'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTION:

 Exemption from section 9(a) under section 9(c).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicant has been granted a conditional temporary order, and has requested a conditional permanent order, under
section 9(c) exempting applicant from section 9(a) to the extent necessary to permit applicant to employ an individual
who is subject to a securities related injunction. The temporary order will expire on the earlier of ninety days from
the entry of the temporary order, the date on which the SEC sets PaineWebber's application for permanent relief for
a hearing, or the date on which the SEC takes final action on the application. The notice gives interested persons until
January 12, 1995 to request a hearing on PaineWebber's request for a permanent order.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. PaineWebber, a Delaware corporation, is a registered broker-dealer and registered investment adviser. PaineWebber
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Paine Webber Group Inc. (``PWG''). PaineWebber serves as the investment adviser and
principal underwriter of registered investment companies and proposes to act as investment adviser and principal
underwriter to additional investment companies in the future. A wholly owned subsidiary of PaineWebber, Mitchell
Hutchins Asset Management Inc. (``Mitchell Hutchins'') serves as sub-advisor and sub-administrator to the registered
investment companies underwritten and advised by PaineWebber. In addition, Mitchell Hutchins is the investment
adviser and principal underwriter for a number of open-end and closed-end registered investment companies, and
anticipates serving in similar capacities with regard to additional registered investment companies in the future.
PaineWebber is also the sole depositor, or a co-depositor, and/or underwriter of numerous unit investment trusts.

2. General Electric Company (``GE''), the parent company of Kidder, Peabody & Co. Incorporated (``Kidder''),
and Kidder have entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated October 17, 1994, with PWG. The asset purchase agreement
provides for the purchase by PWG and certain of its subsidiaries of certain assets of Kidder and its subsidiaries,
and contemplates the employment by PaineWebber of Kidder employees.

3. PaineWebber currently is not disqualified from acting in any of the capacities specified in section 9(a) of the
Act.
 Subject to receiving the requested exemption, however, PaineWebber proposes to employ Stanley S. Trotman, Jr. (``Mr.
Trotman'') in the health sciences group within its investment banking department. Mr. Trotman is subject to a securities
related injunction. Absent relief, Mr. Trotman's employment would cause PaineWebber to become disqualified under
section 9(a) of the Act from acting in any of the capacities specified in that section. Accordingly, PaineWebber seeks
the requested relief so that applicant, and any affiliated person of applicant, will not be disqualified from acting
in any of the capacities specified in section 9(a) by reason of employing Mr. Trotman.





4. Mr. Trotman currently co-heads the health care group within the investment banking department of Kidder. Prior
to holding this position, Mr. Trotman was a director of Charter Medical Corporation, T2 Medical, Inc., and Salick,
Healthcare, Inc. Until February 16, 1990, when Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, the parent of Drexel Burnham Lambert,
Incorporated (``Drexel''), filed for bankruptcy protection, Mr. Trotman was a managing director of Drexel in charge
of the health care group in its corporate finance department.

<TEXT>
 

5. On or about December 19, 1985, Drexel and Mr. Trotman consented to the entry of a final judgment and order of permanent
injunction (the ``Injunction'') in an action commenced by the SEC. Civil Action No. 85-9855 (United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York). The activities forming the basis for the Injunction took place
from approximately November 1981 to June 14, 1982, during which time Drexel acted as co-lead manager for two public
offerings of securities issued by Flight Transportation Corporation (``Flight''). The SEC's complaint alleged
that Drexel and Mr. Trotman violated sections 17(a) (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with Drexel's
due diligence investigation for the underwriting of approximately $25.6 million of securities issued by Flight
in June 1982. The complaint alleged that the registration statement Flight filed with the SEC for these securities
contained materially false and misleading statements relating to the group charter business, including among other
things, the statement that Flight's $23 million group charter business comprised approximately one-third of Flight's
revenues, when, in fact, the group charter business did not and never had existed. The complaint alleged that Drexel
and Mr. Trotman placed undue reliance on the statements of Flight's management and failed to verify independently
the existence of Flight's group charger business by not contacting the customers or suppliers of the group charter
business. The terms of the Injunction required Mr. Trotman to submit his due diligence work for review by Drexel's
underwriting assistance committee for a period of four months and for Drexel to submit its written due diligence procedures
for review by outside counsel for an opinion as to the adequacy of the procedures.

6. On December 20, 1985, the SEC issued a temporary order under section 9(c) of the Act which exempted Drexel from section
9(a) with respect to the Injunction. On February 24, 1986, the SEC granted Drexel a permanent order under section 9(c)
of the Act.






7. In 1990, Kidder proposed to hire Mr. Trotman as co-head of its health care group. On May 24, 1990, the SEC issued a temporary
order under section 9(c) granting Kidder relief from the prohibitions of section 9(a) resulting from the Injunction.
On June 20, 1990, the SEC granted Kidder a permanent order under section 9(c).






8. In the capacity of his employment with PaineWebber, Mr. Trotman would be expected to advise and assist PaineWebber's
corporate clients with their corporate financing, acquisition, and disposition needs. Together with a team of investment
banking specialists, Mr. Trotman would solicit investment banking clients, perform due diligence investments
of corporation in connection with proposed underwritings, acquisitions, or dispositions, work with counsel to
prepare underwriting documents, solicit prospective investors in connection with securities offerings, and structure,
price, and otherwise negotiate the terms of securities offerings.

9. PaineWebber requests: (a) a temporary order exempting it from the provisions of section 9(a) for a period of up to
90 days following the date of the order to relieve it from any ineligibility under section 9(a) by reason of the employment
by applicant of Mr. Trotman; and (b) a permanent order granting the request relief.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 9(a)(2) of the Act, in pertinent part, disqualifies any person from acting in the capacity of employee,
officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor for any registered investment
company, or principal underwriter for any registered open-end company, registered unit investment trust, or registered
face-amount certificate company, if such person is, by reason of any misconduct, permanently or temporarily enjoined
from acting as an underwriter, broker, dealer, or investment adviser, or from engaging in or continuing any conduct
or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. A company
with an employee or other affiliated person ineligible to serve in any of these capacities under section 9(a)(2) is
similarly ineligible by reason of section 9(a)(3).

2. Section 9(c) of the Act provides that, upon application, the SEC shall grant an exemption from the disqualification
provisions of section 9(a), either unconditionally or on an appropriate temporary or other conditional basis, if
it is established that the prohibitions of section 9(a), as applied to the applicant, are unduly or disproportionately
severe or that the conduct of such person has been such as not to make it against the public interest or protection of
investors to grant such application.

3. In support of its position that the SEC should grant the requested exemptions from the prohibitions of section 9(a),
PaineWebber asserts that:

(a) Neither PaineWebber nor any affiliated person of PaineWebber was the subject of the Injunction, and the facts
and circumstances to which the Injunction relate do not involve any activities of PaineWebber or its affiliates.

(b) None of the PaineWebber investment companies were in any way involved in any of the circumstances referred to in
the Injunction.

(c) As an employee in PaineWebber's investment banking department, Mr. Trotman will have no involvement with, or
responsibilities for, the PaineWebber investment companies.

(d) The allegations in the Commission's complaint against Mr. Trotman and the terms of the Injunction and the circumstances
to which they relate in no way involve any activities of an investment company. During Mr. Trotman's tenure with Kidder
and Drexel, he was not involved with the activities of any of Kidder's or Drexel's investment companies.

(e) Since the entry of the Injunction, Mr. Trotman has not been subject to any similar actions, or sanctioned in any
way by the SEC, any self-regulatory organization, or any state securities commission, nor are there any customer
complaints, lawsuits, or regulatory actions pending against Mr. Trotman.

(f) The prohibitions of section 9(a) deprive Mr. Trotman of the opportunity to serve as an employee of any company,
such as PaineWebber, that serves as an investment adviser, principle underwriter, or depositor of investment companies,
in circumstances in which he would have no involvement in investment company operations.

(g) The prohibitions of section 9(a) would be unduly and disproportionately severe as applied to applicant because
they would deprive PaineWebber of Mr. Trotman's services in an area totally unrelated to the activities of an investment
company.

(h) Because the Commission has previously considered and granted, to both Drexel and Kidder, temporary and permanent
exemptions from the provisions of section 9(a) operative as a result of the Injunction, it is appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the Act that the temporary exemption be granted.

(i) The temporary exemption is appropriate as it would: (i) permit Mr. Trotman to commence his employment with PaineWebber
and thus avoid loss of income which could occur if he were forced to forego this employment pending the final disposition
of the application; (ii) permit PaineWebber to provide investment banking services to former clients of Kidder that
wish to continue to utilize Mr. Trotman's services as an employee of PaineWebber; (iii) provide continuity of services
for such clients; and (iv) allow PaineWebber to provide continuity of service to its investment company clients.

4. In making the application, PaineWebber acknowledges, understands, and agrees that the application and any exemption
issued by the SEC to applicant shall be without prejudice to, and shall not limit, the SEC's rights in any manner with
respect to any SEC investigation or enforcement action under the federal securities laws, or the consideration by
the SEC of any application for exemption from statutory requirements, including, without limitation, the consideration
of the instant application for a permanent exemption pursuant to section 9(c) from the provisions of section 9(a)
of the Act or the revocation or removal of any exemption granted in connection with the application.



Applicant's Condition



As a condition of the requested relief, neither PaineWebber, nor any affiliated person of PaineWebber relying upon
relief granted pursuant to the application, will employ Mr. Trotman in any capacity related directly to the provision
of investment advisory services to, or acting as a depositor for, any registered investment company or to acting as
a principal underwriter for any registered open-end investment company, unit investment trust or registered face
amount certificate company without first making further application to the SEC.



Temporary Order



The Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority, has considered the matter and finds that,
under the standards of section 9(c) of the Act applicable to this matter, applicant has made the showing necessary
to justify granting a temporary exemption. Accordingly,

It is ordered, under section 9(c) of the Act, that applicant is hereby temporarily exempted from the provisions of
section 9(a) of the Act, for a period to expire on the earlier of ninety days from the entry of the temporary order, the
date on which the SEC sets PaineWebber's application for permanent relief for a hearing, or the date on which the SEC
takes final action on the application for an order granting applicant a permanent exemption from the provisions of
section 9(a).

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').





APPLICANTS: 

SunAmerica Inc., Anchor National Life Insurance Company (``Anchor National''), Variable Separate Account (``Separate
Account'') and SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. (collectively, ``Applicants'').



RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting an exemption from Section 22(d) thereof.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to the extent necessary to permit Anchor National or any other insurance company controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with, Anchor National (collectively, ``Affiliated Insurers'') to waive,
in certain circumstances, the contingent deferred sales load that otherwise would be imposed on certain individual
and group flexible payment deferred variable annuity contracts (``Contracts'') issued and to be issued by Anchor
National or the other Affiliated Insurers.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the SEC.


Applicants' Representations


1. Anchor National, a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of California, is an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of SunAmerica Inc., a financial services company.
2. Anchor National established the Separate Account on June 25, 1981, to fund variable annuity contracts. The Separate
Account is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust.
3. SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. (``SEC''), the principal underwriter for certain of the existing Contracts,
is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. SCS also is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SunAmerica Inc.
4. The Contracts are or will be issued by Anchor National or other Affiliated Insurers and offered through the Separate
Account or any other separate account (as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act) of the issuing Affiliated Insurer
that is registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act (collectively, ``Eligible Account(s)''). The Contracts
will provide for accumulation of contract values and payment of benefits on a variable basis. Fixed accumulation
and/or payment options also may be available under the Contracts. (In the case of group Contracts, the term ``Contract,''
as used herein, will include a certificate issued to a participant in the group; the term ``Contract owner'' will include
such a participant.)
5. Various fees and charges may be deducted from contract values or the assets of an Eligible Account to pay for expenses
incurred in connection with administering and selling the Contract and for assuming certain risks thereunder. All
such charges will be permitted either pursuant to rules adopted under the 1940 Act or by order of the Commission, and
will be fully disclosed in the prospectuses for the Contracts.
6. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') may be imposed upon certain withdrawals from the Contracts. The
CDSC may vary in amount, according to a schedule contained in the applicable Contract and described in its prospectus,
depending upon the contribution year of the purchase payment being withdrawn. Purchase payments withdrawn after
a specified period of time will not be subject to the CDSC and may be withdrawn free of such charge. The applicable Contracts
prescribe the circumstances in which the CDSC may be reduced or waived, including in connection with the ``Confinement
Waiver benefit'' described below.

7. Under a Contract to which the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' applies, the CDSC will be waived upon the Contract
owner's request for full or partial surrender of the Contract value prior to the annuity date. This ``Confinement
Waiver benefit'' will be available if:
 The Contract owner is confined to an eligible nursing home and/or hospital for at least 60 consecutive days
while the Contract is in force;
 A surrender or partial withdrawal request and adequate proof of confinement are received by the Affiliated
Insurer either while the Contract owner is confined or within 90 days of the Contract owner's discharge from the nursing
home or hospital; and
 Confinement in the nursing home and/or hospital is prescribed by a physician and is medically necessary.

8. The ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' may not be exercised before the expiration of 90 days from the date the Contract
is issued.

9. A new 60 day confinement period must be satisfied each time the Contract owner becomes newly confined (whether for
the same unrelated causes), if services by an eligible nursing home and/or hospital have not been provided for a period
of at least six months. A new 60 day confinement need not be satisfied, however, if services for related causes were
provided within six months of current receipt of services.

10. Anchor National and SunAmerica Inc. have determined that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' is a desirable feature,
and beneficial to variable annuity contract owners. Accordingly, they wish to have the flexibility to incorporate
such a feature in both existing and new Contracts, in jurisdictions where permitted.

11. In jurisdictions where permitted, Affiliated Insurers will make the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' available
to all new owners of affected Contracts. The Affiliated Insurers reserve the right not to make the ``Confinement Waiver
benefit'' available to certain of their existing Contracts. Alternatively, an Affiliated Insurer may make the ``Confinement
Waiver benefit'' available to existing Contracts subject to the satisfaction of eligibility requirements uniformly
applied to owners of such Contracts_

e.g., 

the making of an additional purchase payment under the Contract within a specified period of time, and in a prescribed
amount (which may vary depending on whether the Contract is held in connection with a tax-qualified plan).



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, the Commission may, by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally
exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from
any provision or provisions of the 1940 Act or from any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such
exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Section 6(c), the Applicants
request that the Commission issue an order to provide the exemptive relief set forth below.

2. Applicants submit that granting the requested relief not only to variable annuity contracts issued by Anchor National
and funded in the Separate Account, but also to variable annuity contracts funded in other separate accounts that
Anchor National has or may establish, will eliminate the necessity for filing multiple applications for relief under
circumstances where no new issues would be presented by the subsequent applications. Similar reasoning applies
to extending the relief to apply to Contracts issued by other Affiliated Insurers as well.

3. Section 22(d) of the 1940 Act provides that no registered investment company shall sell any redeemable security
issued by it to any person except either to or through a principal underwriter for distribution, or at a current public
offering price described in the prospectus. Applicants recognize that the proposed waiver of the withdrawal charge
in connection with the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' described above could be viewed as causing the Contracts to
be sold at other than a uniform offering price.

4. Under certain prescribed conditions, Rule 22d-1 under the 1940 Act provides an exemption from Section 22(d)
to the extent necessary to permit the sale of redeemable securities issued by a registered investment company at prices
that reflect scheduled variations in, or elimination of, the sales load to particular classes of investors or transactions.
However, to the extent that it has been interpreted by the Commission as granting relief only for scheduled variations
in front-end sales loads_not deferred sales loads such as the CDSC_Rule 22d-1 is not directly applicable to
Applicants' proposed waiver of the withdrawal charge in connection with the ``Confinement Waiver benefit.'' Applicants
nevertheless submit that by adopting Rule 22d-1, the Commission has decided that variations in front-end sales
loads should be permitted universally, subject to the standards embodied in that Rule, and that similar considerations
should apply with at least the same force for the requested variation in deferred sales charges.

5. Rule 22d-2 under the 1940 Act exempts registered variable annuity accounts, their principal underwriters,
dealers and sponsoring insurance companies from Section 22(d) to the extent necessary to permit variations in the
sales load or in any administrative charge or other deductions from the purchase payments, provided that any such
variations reflect differences in costs or services, are not unfairly discriminatory, and are adequately described
in the prospectus. Applicants do not represent that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' reflects differences in
sales costs or services, however, and for that reason do not rely on Rule 22d-2 for the requested relief, even
assuming that Rule 22d-2 does apply to deferred sales loads.

6. Applicants note that while Rule 6c-8 under the 1940 Act permits variable annuity separate accounts to impose
a deferred sales charge, it neither imposes any conditions on the ability of an investment company to provide for variations
in the deferred sales charges nor provides an exemption from Section 22(d).

7. Applicants submit that the proposed waiver is consistent with the policies of Section 22(d) and the rules promulgated
thereunder. One of the purposes of Section 22(d) is to prevent an investment company from discriminating among investors
by charging different prices to different investors. Applicants represent that because the ``Confinement Waiver
benefit'' will be available prospectively to any new Contract owner who becomes confined to a hospital or nursing
home for 60 days or more (as is described more fully above), the benefit will not unfairly discriminate among Contract
owners in jurisdictions where it is permitted by state law. Applicants further represent that the benefit advantages
Contract owners by permitting them to surrender their Contracts without imposition of the withdrawal charge, upon
the occurrence of the contingency described above, and that the benefit will not result in dilution of the interests
of any other Contract owner. Applicants also represent that waiving the withdrawal charge under such circumstances
will not result in the occurrence of any of the abuses that Section 22(d) of the Act is designed to prevent.

8. Applicants represent that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit,'' if offered in connection with a particular Contract,
would comply with the substantive provisions set forth in Rule 22d-1 under the 1940 Act. More specifically represent
that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' will be: uniformly available to all Contract owners who are eligible therefor;
and adequately described in the applicable prospectus for the Contracts (or supplements thereto) before being made
available to Contract owners. If the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' is made available to existing Contracts, the
Affiliated Insurers will inform owners of the relevant Contracts of the availability of the benefit by transmitting
a copy of the endorsement or rider for attachment to their Contracts (as well as by supplementing the prospectus for
such Contracts), as soon as is reasonably practicable. If the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' is made available to
existing Contracts subject to the satisfaction of eligibility requirements, the Affiliated Insurers will inform
the owners of the relevant Contracts of the availability of the benefit and the relevant requirements by transmitting
a current prospectus or supplement thereto that adequately describes the benefit and the requirements.



Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, Applicants submit that the exemptive relief requested above is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

13 CFR 107.302 limits maximum annual Cost of Money (as defined in 13 CFR 107.3) that may be imposed upon a Small Concern
in connection with Financing by means of Loans or through the purchase of Debt Securities. The cited regulation incorporates
the term ``Debenture Rate'', which is defined elsewhere in 13 CFR 107.3 in terms that require SBA to publish, from time
to time, the rate charged on ten-year debentures sold by Licensees to the public.

Accordingly, Licensees are hereby notified that effective the date of publication of this Notice, and until further
notice, the Debenture Rate for computation of maximum cost of money pursuant to 13 CFR 107.302 is 8.50 percent per annum.

13 CFR 107.302 does not supersede or preempt any applicable law imposing an interest ceiling lower than the ceiling
imposed by its own terms. Attention is directed to Section 308(i) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended,
to that law's Federal override of State usury ceilings, and to its forfeiture and penalty provisions.

Approval of Noise Compatibility Program, Lake Tahoe Airport, South Lake Tahoe, CA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FFA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by the City South Lake Tahoe, California, under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement
Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description
of federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1989). On November 14, 1994 the FAA determined
that the noise exposure maps submitted by the City under Part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements.
On November 14, 1994, the Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Lake Tahoe Airport noise compatibility
program. Thirteen (13) of the proposed action elements were approved and four (4) elements were disapproved for purposes
of Part 150.








</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for the Lake Tahoe
Airport, effective November 14, 1994.



Under Section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map, may submit to the FAA, a noise compatibility
program which sets for the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users and FAA personnel.

Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program not a federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941227-2-00158 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941227-2-00104 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;


b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;


c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
type or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the federal government; and


d. Program measures relating to the use of light procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.


Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
FAR Part 150, Section 150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, request for project
grant must be submitted to the Airports District Office at the location identified in 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

clause above. The City of South Lake Tahoe submitted to the FAA on September 24, 1992, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions,
and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from January 1984 through
December 1991. The Lake Tahoe Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable
requirements on May 18, 1994. Notice of this determination was published in the 

Federal Register 

on June 8, 1994.


The Lake Tahoe Airport Study contains proposed noise compatibility program comprised on actions designed for phased
implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to (or beyond)
the year 2000. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as
described in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on November 14, 1994, and was required
by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180-days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-days period shall be deemed to be
an approval of such a program.


The submitted program contained seventeen (17) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The
FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150
have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Associate Administrator for Airports effective
November 14, 1994.


Outright approval was granted for thirteen (13) of the specific program elements. The approved elements included
existing noise abatement procedures, preferential runway use procedures, runup policies, request FAA advisories,
noise abatement program, noise monitoring system, rezoning, navigation easements, and property purchase options.
Four (4) program elements were disapproved for purposes of Part 150 pending submission of sufficient information.

These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports
on November 14, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the
submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the City of
South Lake Tahoe.


Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading,

Valuation of Collateral for Treasury Tax and Loan Depositaries 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Financial Management Service, Fiscal Service, Treasury. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice informs interested parties that the Department of the Treasury has directed its fiscal agent, the Federal
Reserve, to change the method of determining the value of collateral pledged by depositaries to secure Treasury Tax
and Loan (TT&L) deposits. Current regulations published in the Code of Federal Regulations provide that collateral
will be accepted at values assigned by the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs). This change in collateral valuation is being
implemented concurrently and in a manner consistent with the FRBs' new valuation methodology for collateral pledged
by financial institutions to secure borrowings from the Federal Reserve. The current FRB methodology for TT&L
and the discount window generally values securities at par value to which margins may be applied; the new methodology
will value collateral at market prices, where available, to which margins may be applied. In addition, the FRBs are
currently developing a uniform methodology to value definitive collateral for which no market prices are available.
These changes will assign more equitable values to collateral. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:

 The Financial Management Service (Service), acting through the Federal Reserve as fiscal agent of the United States,
designates Treasury Tax and Loan (TT&L) depositaries. Current regulations promulgated in the Code of Federal
Regulations provide that collateral will be accepted at values assigned by the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs). 31 CFR
203.14(d). Currently, the FRBs value pledged collateral at the outstanding principal balance or the outstanding
principal balance reduced by a margin. A margin, or haircut, is the deduction of a certain percentage of the value of
the collateral. 



This notice announces the FRBs' new methodology for valuing TT&L collateral. Under the new methodology, the
FRBs will 
value the collateral using market prices, where available, or determine a value based on risk characteristics. 

The resulting final collateral value assigned by the FRBs may be more or less than par value. This new valuation system
is intended to increase the accuracy of the value assigned to collateral in relation to the deposits at risk. 

The new valuation methodology will be implemented in phases, beginning January 1, 1995. Phase 1 will encompass definitive
securities for which reliable and active markets exist, and for which market pricing is available to the FRBs. Initially,
the margin applied in phase 1 will be the existing margins. These margins may be modified later. 

Phase 2, to be implemented later in 1995, will cover all remaining definitive collateral. The FRBs will value this
definitive collateral, for which a reliable and active market does not exist, using an enhanced valuation methodology.


Lastly, the FRBs will value collateral held in book-entry form at the FRBs using a market based methodology in approximately
2 years. 

The Service has sent to all TT&L depositaries, a 

Special Notice to Depositaries,

 which provided additional information on this change in the method of collateral valuation. In addition, the Federal
Reserve has provided depositaries a separate information package.

<DOCTITLE>Rehabilitation Research and Development Scientific Review and Evaluation Board Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee
for Cooperative Studies, and Health Services and Rehabilitation Research and Development; Meeting</DOCTITLE>


The Department of Veterans Affairs gives notice under Public Law 92-463 (Federal Advisory Committee Act) as
amended, by section 5(c) of Public Law 94-409 that a meeting of the Rehabilitation Research and Development
Scientific Review and Evaluation Board Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Cooperative Studies, and Health
Services and Rehabilitation Research and Development will be held at the Vista International Hotel, 1400 ``M'' Street
NW., Washington, DC, on January 10 through January 13, 1995.
The session on January 10, 1995, is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. and end at 9:30 p.m. The sessions on January 11, 12,
13, 1995, are scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. The purpose of the meeting is to review rehabilitation research
and development applications for scientific and technical merit and to make recommendations to the Director, Rehabilitation
Research and Development Services, regarding their funding.
The meeting will be open to the public up to the seating capacity of the room for the January 10 session for the discussion
of administrative matters, the general status of the program, and the administrative details of the review process.
On January 11-13, 1995 the meeting is closed during which the Board will be reviewing research and development
applications.
This review involves oral comments, discussion of site visits, staff, and consultant critiques of proposed research
protocols, and similar analytical documents that necessitate the consideration of the personal qualifications,
performance and competence of individual research investigators. Disclosure of such information would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Disclosure would also reveal research proposals and research
underway which could lead to the loss of these projects to third parties and thereby frustrate future agency research
efforts.
Thus, the closing is in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 522b(c)(6), and (c)(9)(B) and the determination of the Secretary
of the Department of Veterans Affairs under Sections 10(d) of Pub. L. 92-463 as amended by Section 5(c) of Pub.
L. 94-409.
Due to the limited seating capacity of the room, those who plan to attend the open session should write to Ms. Victoria
Mongiardo, Program Analyst, Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, Department of Veterans Affairs,
103 South Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202 (Phone: 410-962-2563) at least five days before the meeting.

UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNORS



Notice of Vote to Close Meeting



By telephone vote on December 21, 1994, a majority of the members contacted and voting, the Board of Governors of the
United States Postal Service voted to add to the agenda of its meeting closed to public observation on January 9, 1995,
in Washington, D.C. (see 59 FR 64014, December 12, 1994), consideration of a funding request for the Santa Barbara,
California, Processing & Distribution Center.

The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp,
Mackie, Pace and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary to the Board
Harris, and General Counsel Elcano.

The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(i) of
Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion of this matter is exempt from the open meeting requirement of
the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information, the premature
disclosure of which would significantly frustrate proposed procurement actions. The Board further determined
that the public interest does not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be open to the public.

In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal
Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting
may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code and
section 7.3(i) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.
 
Requests for information about the meeting should be addressed to the Secretary of the Board, David F. Harris, at (202)
268-4800.

No exceptions to the mailing and hand-delivery conditions set forth in this notice will be granted. Funding applications
not meeting the conditions set forth in this notice will not be accepted. 



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice provides instructions to applicants for Federal assistance under JTPA Title IV, Migrant and Seasonal
Farmworker Programs for PY 1995, and consists of: Part I_Introduction; and Part II_Solicitation for Grant Application
(SGA). Part II constitute invitations from the Department of Labor (DOL) for public agencies, and private nonprofit
organizations authorized by their Charters or Articles of Incorporation to provide training and employment and
other services described in this notice to submit funding applications for Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Programs
for PY 1995.



Part I_Introduction and Background



JTPA establishes programs to prepare youth and unskilled adults for entry into the labor force, and to afford job training
to those economically disadvantaged individuals and others facing serious barriers to employment who are in special
need of such training to obtain productive employment. In accordance with 29 U.S.C. 1501 

et seq

., regulations promulgated by DOL to implement JTPA are set forth at parts 626 through 638 and 1005 of Title 20, Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR). 
As stated at 20 CFR 633.102, it is the purpose of section 402 of JTPA, 29 U.S.C. 1672, to provide job training, employment
opportunities, and other services for those individuals who suffer chronic seasonal unemployment and underemployment
in the agriculture industry. These conditions have been substantially aggravated by continual advancements in
technology and mechanization resulting in displacement and contribute significantly to the Nation's rural employment
problem. These factors substantially affect the entire national economy. Because of the special nature of farmworker
employment and training problems, such programs are centrally administered at the national level. Programs and
activities supported under this section shall, in accordance with section 402(c)(3) of JTPA: 
(1) Enable farmworkers and their dependents to obtain or retain employment;
(2) Allow participation in other program activities leading to their eventual placement in unsubsidized agricultural
or nonagricultural employment;
(3) Allow activities leading to stabilization in agricultural employment; and 
(4) Include related assistance and supportive services. 
Regulations promulgated by DOL to implement the provisions of Title IV, section 402, of JTPA are set forth in 20 CFR
part 633 and part 636. In addition, State and local governments and Native American applicants must conform to Administrative
Requirements at 29 CFR part 97. Non-profit organizations must conform to Administrative Regulations at 29 CFR part
95. Migrant and other seasonally employed farmworker programs are also subject to 29 CFR parts 93 (New Restrictions
on Lobbying), 96 (Audit Requirements for Grants, Contracts and other agreements), and 98 (Disbarment, Suspension
and Drug-free Workplace requirements). 
Should the regulations at parts 633 and 636 conflict with regulations elsewhere in 20 CFR, the regulations at parts
633 and 636 shall control with respect to programs and activities governed by these Parts. 20 CFR 633.103(b). Further,
should any instructions in this notice conflict with JTPA regulations, the JTPA regulations shall control. Applicants
should consult and be familiar with 20 CFR part 633 in its entirety. 
Pursuant to 20 CFR 633.201, DOL will not consider any funding application when fraud or criminal activity has been
proven to exist within the applicant organization, or when efforts by the DOL to recover debts established by final
agency action have been unsuccessful. Prior to the final selection of an applicant as a potential grantee, DOL will
conduct a Responsibility Review of the available records to establish an organization's overall responsibility
to administer Federal funds in accordance with 20 CFR 633.204. Any applicant which is not considered or selected as
a potential grantee because of these provisions shall be advised of its appeal rights. 


Comments From the States


Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and the implementing regulations at
29 CFR part 17, are applicable to this program. Pursuant to these requirements, in States which have established a
consultation process expressly covering this program, applications shall be provided to the State for comment.
Since States also may participate as competitors for this program, applications shall be submitted to the State upon
the deadline for submission to DOL. 20 CFR 633.202(d). 
To strengthen the implementation of E.O. 12372, DOL specifies the following timeframe for its treatment of comments
from the State's Single Point of Contact (SPOC) on JTPA section 402 applications: 
1. As required by 29 CFR 17.8(a)(2), the SPOC must submit comments, if any, to DOL no later than 60 days after the deadline
date for applications;
2. DOL will forward those comments to the applicant within 10 days of their receipt from the SPOC;
3. The applicant must submit its response to the SPOC's comments, if any, to DOL no later than 10 days after the date of
receipt from DOL; and
4. DOL will notify the SPOC of its decision regarding the comments and response, but will not implement that decision
for at least 10 days after the SPOC has been notified.

State Planning Estimates 



State planning estimates are provided in an Appendix to this notice, solely for the purpose of developing the funding
applications. These estimates are the same as the PY 1994 allocations. Final allocation levels for PY 1995 will be
published at a later date. 



Part II_Solicitation for Grant Application 



Subpart (a). Preapplication 



Program Year 1995 section 402 funds are available for competition in all States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
with the exception of Alaska, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia. Pursuant to regulations at 20 CFR 633.105(b)(2),
DOL reserves the right not to allocate any funds for use in a State whose allocation according to the funding formula
is less than $120,000. 

Applications for Statewide programs are encouraged, but are not necessary. Applicants applying for grants shall
submit a preapplication consisting of: 

(1) A Standard Form 424 Facesheet found in OMB Circular No. A-102, and, as an attachment to this solicitation;


(2) An attachment identifying, by State or county, the proposed service area; and 

(3) For a private nonprofit organization, a recent (within the last six months) certification from a Certified Public
Accountant that its financial management system is capable of properly accounting for and safeguarding Federal
funds; or, for a public agency, a recent (within the last six months) certification by its Chief Fiscal Officer attesting
to the adequacy of the agency's accounting system to properly account for and safeguard Federal funds. 

The Preapplication for Federal Assistance shall be submitted as part of the application package and should also include
the following: 

(1) A statement indicating the legally constituted authority under which the organization functions. An applicant
which is a nonprofit organization shall submit a copy of its Charter or Articles of Incorporation to satisfy this requirement;


(2) An employer identification number from the Internal Revenue Service and, for nonprofit applicants, proof of
the organization's nonprofit status. 



Subpart (b). Applications for Funding 



DOL is soliciting applications for grants under the provisions of JTPA Title IV, section 402, to provide training,
employment opportunities, and other services to migrant and other seasonal farmworkers. 



Review of Funding Applications 



Applications will be reviewed and rated by a competitive review panel, using the specific review standards cited
at 20 CFR 633.203. Panel results are advisory in nature and are not binding on the Grant Officer. In addition, prior
to the final selection of an applicant as a potential grantee, DOL will conduct a Responsibility Review of the available
records pursuant to 20 CFR 633.204. This review is intended to establish overall responsibility to administer Federal
funds and is independent of the competitive process. Applicants failing to meet the requirements of that or other
sections of the regulations will not be selected as potential grantees irrespective of their standing in the competition.




Specific Rating Criteria 



The rating criteria and the weights assigned to each are described below: 

(i) 

An understanding of the problems of migrant and seasonal farmworkers. 

Range 0 to 20 points. This factor rates the applicant's analysis of the needs of the target group, including socio-economic
characteristics of the client population and the proposed program's potential to address those needs. Ratings are
based on a clear and concise narrative demonstrating this understanding; appropriateness of the proposed program
mix of training and supportive services meeting the identified needs; and responsiveness to JPTA goals of targeting
the hard-to-serve for training which leads to skills acquisition, long-term employability and increased earnings.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

A familiarity with the area to be served.

 Range 0 to 25 points. This factor rates the applicant's knowledge of the resources of the service area, and the proposed
linkages, coordination, and partnerships with different segments of the community within a designated service
delivery area_to further the training and placement of farmworkers into new and better jobs; 

i.e.,

 plans for involving appropriate area agencies and programs in the design and delivery of training and other services
proposed to meet the needs of participants. It includes a demonstrated knowledge of approximate size and location
within the State of the eligible client population, current and changing market place needs, including areas of emerging
technologies, and how the changing skill requirements will be reflected in the proposed program activities. Ratings
are based on a clear and concise narrative demonstrating this familiarity, and documented programmatic ties to appropriate
area agencies and programs. 

 (iii) 

A previously demonstrated capability to administer effectively a diversified employability development program.

 Range 0 to 30 points. This factor rates program experience, and capability to meet or exceed planned goals. Ratings
are based on a previously demonstrated capability to administer effectively a diversified employability development
program for migrant and seasonal farmworkers; documentation that planned performance goals were either met or exceeded
during the period of performance; and satisfactory description of the employment and training components and procedures
necessary to undertake the goals of this grant solicitations. 

 (iv) 

General administrative and financial management capability.

 Range 0 to 25 points. This factor rates the applicant's managerial experience, and the potential for efficient and
effective administration of the proposed program. In the case of applicants competing for two or more States or sub-State
areas, the application for each State or sub-State area should contain a statement describing the manner in which
the grant recipient will conduct monitoring and provide technical assistance and support to each of the States' operations
for which it achieves responsibility to the Department of Labor. Ratings are based on consideration of the administrative
expertise of present and proposed managerial and decision-making staff, and the extent to which the management plan
demonstrates the ability to capably and economically operate a multi-activity delivery system. Finally, the applicant
should expound on those cost benefits which will accrue to the Department of Labor through a multi-jurisdiction (State)
approach over that offered through the management of a single venue grant. 

 

Content and Format of Funding Application 

 

Exclusive of letters of support and commitment, the funding application should not exceed 50 pages of double-spaced
unreduced type. Detailed budgets and program planning estimates are not to be part of the funding application. These
will be negotiated later with applic
