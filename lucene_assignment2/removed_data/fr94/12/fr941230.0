OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT











Pay Under the General Schedule; Locality-Based Comparability Payments



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing final regulations that reflect the final determination of the President's
Pay Agent concerning the locality pay areas within which locality-based comparability payments will be paid beginning
in January 1995. The regulations remove four metropolitan areas from the ``Rest of U.S.'' locality pay area, establish
four new locality pay areas corresponding to these metropolitan areas, and move five pay localities that were established
as locality pay areas in 1994 into the ``Rest of U.S.'' locality pay area. In addition, the regulations remove San Francisco
as an interim geographic adjustment area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 18, 1994, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published proposed regulations (59 FR 52467) based
on a recommendation of the Federal Salary Council to remove six metropolitan areas from the ``Rest of U.S.'' locality
pay area and establish six new locality pay areas corresponding to these metropolitan areas. At the direction of the
President's Pay Agent (consisting of the Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
and the Director of OPM), the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted local salary surveys in 1993-94 in these six
areas, which were in addition to the 27 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA's) and Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical
Areas (CMSA's) within which the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducted salary surveys for the implementation
of locality pay in January 1994.




The Council recommended that any area in which the pay disparity is 2/10ths of a percentage point or more below the pay
disparity for ``Rest of U.S.'' should be dropped as a separate pay locality and combined with ``Rest of U.S.'' The data
needed to make the determination for the six proposed areas did not become available until after the proposed regulations
were published. Four of the proposed six metropolitan areas met the conditions recommended by the Council for removal
from the ``Rest of U.S.'' locality pay area and establishment as separate pay localities. These four new locality
pay areas are (1) Columbus, OH; (2) Miami-Fort Lauderdale, FL; (3) Portland-Salem, OR-WA; and (4) Richmond-Petersburg,
VA. Two of the six proposed areas, Albuquerque, NM, and New Orleans, LA, have pay disparities that are more than 2/10ths
of a percentage point below that for the ``Rest of U.S.'' area. Therefore, they will remain in the ``Rest of U.S.'' area.

There are also five areas that were established by the Pay Agent as locality pay areas for 1994 that are being dropped
as separate locality pay areas and combined with ``Rest of U.S.'' for 1995 because they have pay disparities that are
2/10ths of a percentage point or more below the ``Rest of U.S.'' These areas are (1) Memphis, TN-AR-MS; (2) Norfolk-Virginia
Beach-Newport News, VA-NC; (3) Oklahoma City, OK; (4) Salt Lake City-Ogden, UT; and (5) San Antonio, TX.

There are 27 locality pay areas for 1995. They consist of 26 areas corresponding to MSA's or CMSA's, including certain
``areas of application'' contiguous to 2 CMSA's, plus 1 area composed of the ``Rest of U.S.'' (i.e., those portions
of the 48 contiguous States not located within another locality pay area). MSA's and CMSA's are defined by OMB.

OPM received comments on locality pay areas from two members of Congress, one individual, one agency, and three organizations.
Section 5304(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, authorizes the President's Pay Agent to provide for such pay localities
as the Pay Agent considers appropriate. Comments on the proposed regulations were reviewed by the President's Pay
Agent. The Pay Agent decided to adopt the changes in locality pay areas that were recommended by the Federal Salary
Council. The final regulations list each of the locality pay areas for 1995 and are issued by OPM under the authority
in 5 U.S.C. 5304(i).

Areas of Application



Three commenters requested that certain areas in the ``Rest of U.S.'' locality pay area be added as ``areas of application''
to other locality pay areas. One requested that Hartford County, CT, be added as an area of application to the New York-Northern
New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA CMSA. Another requested that the Rhode Island cities of Providence, Pawtucket,
Cranston, Warwick, West Warwick, and Newport be added as areas of application to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence,
MA-NH-ME-CT CMSA. The third commenter requested that the Massachusetts counties of Barnstable, Dukes, and Nantucket
be added as areas of application to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA-NH-ME-CT CMSA. However, none of these locations
meet all of the criteria set forth by the Federal Salary Council for establishment as areas of application for locality
pay purposes.

The Federal Salary Council's criteria for making its recommendations on ``areas of application'' for the January
1995 locality payments, as outlined in an attachment to the Council's memorandum of September 20, 1994, provided
that to be considered for county-wide areas of application, the affected county must_

1. Be contiguous to a pay locality.

2. Contain at least 2,000 GS-GM employees.

3. Have a significant level of urbanization, based on 1990 Census data. A ``significant level of urbanization'' is
defined as a population density of more than 200 per square mile or at least 90 percent of the population in urbanized
areas.

4. Demonstrate some economic linkage with the pay locality, defined as commuting at a level of 5 percent or more into
or from the areas in question. The areas in question are the contiguous county under consideration and the central
counties (or in the case of New England, the central cores) identified by the Census Bureau for the process of defining
the CMSA's or MSA's involved.

In the case of Hartford County, criterion 4_that commuting into or from the central counties identified by the Census
Bureau for the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA CMSA be at a level of 5 percent_is not met.

With respect to the Rhode Island cities requested as areas of application, under established policies, areas of application
must comprise entire counties (except in cases where a Federal facility crosses pay area boundaries). Even if these
individual cities could be considered, they would not meet criterion 1_that an area of application be contiguous
to a pay locality. Also, they would not meet the 5-percent commuting standard under criterion 4.

In the case of the Massachusetts counties requested as areas of application, none of the counties meets criterion
2. Nantucket and Dukes Counties do not meet criterion 4. Also, Nantucket County fails to meet criterion 1, since it
is not adjacent to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA-NH-ME-CT CMSA.

An agency commented that inconsistent application of criteria for areas of application could lead to unwarranted
expansion of locality pay areas and agreed that it is in the best interest of the locality pay program to continue application
of the criteria developed by the Federal Salary Council in 1994.



Pay Administration



Locality pay rates to be implemented in January 1995 for the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, CA CMSA are greater than
interim geographic adjusted rates for 1995. Therefore, the San Francisco CMSA was deleted as an interim geographic
adjustment (IGA) area by Executive order and is being removed from the definition of 

interim geographic adjustment area

 in  531.101. A conforming change also is being made to ensure that an employee in San Francisco receiving a continued
rate of pay under  531.106 will not be adversely affected by the removal of San Francisco as an IGA area. This is
accomplished by providing an exception in the rules governing the termination of an adjusted rate of pay for an employee
receiving a continued rate in an area that was an IGA area when the continued rate first became applicable in January
1994. (See  531.103(f)(1).)

The definitions of 

scheduled annual rate of pay

 for purposes of computing interim geographic adjustments, special pay adjustments for law enforcement officers,
and locality-based comparability payments in   531.101, 531.301, and 531.602 have been revised to clarify
that a rate of pay resulting from any of these provisions may not be used as the basis for computing the adjusted rate
in question.



Comments Beyond the Scope of These Regulations



A professional association commented that locality payments in 1995 should be extended to Administrative Law Judges
and other senior positions that do not automatically receive locality pay. These determinations are not within the
purview of these regulations. However, on December 1, 1994, the Pay Agent informed heads of executive departments
and agencies that 1995 locality payments would be extended to administrative law judges and various other senior
positions.



Waiver of Delay in Effective Date



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists to make this rule effective in less than 30 days. The
final regulations are being made effective on January 1, 1995, to authorize locality-based comparability payments
in the locality pay areas established by the final regulations on the first day of the first pay period beginning on
or after January 1, 1995, as required by 5 U.S.C. 5304(d)(2) and as directed by the President's memorandum of November
30, 1994, to the President's Pay Agent (59 FR 62549, December 5, 1994).

Federal Employees Health Benefits Program: Procedures for Direct Payment of Premiums



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim regulations with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing interim regulations to eliminate the requirement for the use
of certified mail, return receipt requested, when notifying certain enrollees that their enrollment in the Federal
Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program will be terminated due to nonpayment of premiums unless the payment is received
within 15 days. The purpose of these interim regulations is to reduce the cost of administering the FEHB enrollments
of enrollees who make payments directly rather than through payroll or annuity deductions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Most individuals enrolled under the FEHB Program pay their share of the premiums through withholding from pay or annuity.
However, in some cases enrollees may make direct payments. These include: (1) certain annuitants and compensationers
(individuals who are entitled to compensation from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs based on a job-related
injury or disease) whose annuity or compensation has been waived or suspended; (2) former spouses whose enrollment
is based on a qualifying court order under subpart H of 5 CFR part 890 governing FEHB; and (3) former employees, former
spouses, and children enrolled under the Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) provisions.




The current regulations governing these direct pay situations require that if the employing office does not receive
the payment by the due date, it must notify the enrollee by certified mail, return receipt requested, that continuation
of coverage rests upon payment being made within 15 days after receipt of the notice. (The regulations affecting former
spouses with qualifying court orders and TCC enrollees allow 45 days for enrollees living overseas.) The TCC regulations
further provide that, if the return receipt is not received, termination occurs 60 days after the date of the notice
(90 days for overseas enrollees). All terminations are retroactive to the last day for which the enrollee made payment.
Enrollments terminated for nonpayment of premiums cannot be reinstated unless the enrollee shows that he or she was
prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the payment on time. 

The purpose of the return receipt was to make certain that the enrollee was aware that the employing office had not received
the payment and the consequences of nonpayment. Because of the high cost of certified mail, return receipt requested,
($2.29 per notice) OPM has reevaluated the need for this requirement and has determined that the value of the return
receipt does not justify the cost. The absence of subsequent payments during the 60- to 90-day delay before termination
of the enrollment makes it clear that the initial failure to make the payment was not a simple oversight or loss of the
payment in the mail. 

We believe that the interim regulations will be much more convenient for enrollees. Under current regulations someone
must sign for the notice. If no one is at home when the letter carrier arrives to deliver the return-receipt-requested
letter, the enrollee must go to the post office to sign for it. Under the interim regulations, the letter will be left
in the enrollee's mailbox and the enrollee will have the necessary information without making a trip to the post office.

Most enrollees who stop paying their premiums do so because they no longer need the coverage. In these cases, the current
regulations allow the agency to terminate the enrollment as early as 15 days after the enrollee received the nonreceipt
notice, but there is no real benefit to the enrollee, who no longer wants the coverage.
For other enrollees, a missed payment does not reflect an intent to stop paying the premiums. They may have overlooked
making the payment or their payment may have been lost in the mail. In these cases, the nonpayment notice serves as a
reminder or lets them know that their check was lost. If they do not receive the nonpayment notice, their intent to continue
their coverage will be shown when they make the following month's payment. In addition, there has been a high incidence
of late receipt of payment, with the result that nonreceipt notices cross in the mail with the incoming check. In these
cases, the return receipt notices serve neither as a benefit to the enrollee nor as a means of allowing prompt termination
of an enrollment.
Another group of enrollees stop making their payments because of the cost or out of neglect. Such enrollees generally
continue to miss payments until their enrollment terminates retroactively. Some of them then find they need medical
services, but they have no health coverage. Some continued to obtain medical services even though they were not paying
their premiums and their carriers are now asking for repayment of claims paid or payment for services rendered. When
this happens, the enrollee may ask to have their coverage reinstated. They may have their coverage reinstated if they
can show that they were prevented from paying their premiums on time due to a cause beyond their control.
Under current regulations, if the agency does not receive the signed return receipt, it must wait 60 to 90 days before
terminating the enrollment. Under the interim regulations, agencies must, in all cases, wait 60 to 90 days before
terminating the enrollment. This means that the enrollee must miss two or three more payments before the agency can
act to terminate. While it is possible that a single instance of nonreceipt of the payment represents a check lost in
the mail, it is unlikely that three or four consecutive payments would be similarly lost. Therefore, instead of allowing
termination based on a single instance of nonpayment, the interim regulations allow termination only if there is
a sequence of missing payments. A former enrollee who wants to have an enrollment reinstated after it has been terminated
for nonpayment must show that the nonpayment was due to a cause beyond his or her control. If the former enrollee did
not receive the notice and can show that the sequence of missing payments was due to a cause beyond his or her control,
the employing agency can allow the reinstatement upon payment of all premiums due. Causes beyond an enrollee's control
include physical or mental incapacity; disasters such as floods, hurricanes or fires; or circumstances causing
the enrollee to be out of contact with his or her home for an extended period. Each request for reinstatement must be
considered on its own merits.
If the agency's initial decision is to deny the request, the agency must offer the enrollee the right to reconsideration
of the initial decision at a higher level or by a different office than the one making the initial decision.
The Department of Agriculture's National Finance Center (NFC) administers the TCC accounts and accounts of former
spouses with qualifying court orders for most Federal agencies. NFC issues 2,500 to 3,000 nonpayment notices each
month. Therefore, these interim regulations will result in annual savings of $60,000 to $70,000 for the NFC accounts
alone.
The interim regulations eliminate the requirement for sending the nonpayment notice by certified mail, return receipt
requested. In addition, they clarify that there must be a delay of 60 days (90 days for overseas enrollees) before employing
offices take action to terminate enrollments for nonpayment of premiums. These interim regulations do not address
similar requirements in  890.502 related to employees on leave without pay and annuitants because that section
is being revised and published separately. The revision will include the elimination of the requirement for certified
mail, return receipt requested.

Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking


Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5 of the U.S. Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice
of rulemaking because these interim regulations will result in immediate cost savings without adversely affecting
FEHB enrollees.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they primarily affect individuals enrolled under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

each pay period he or she is covered in accordance with a schedule established by the employing office. If the employing

Relocation; APHIS Central Offices 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations in title 7, chapter III, and title 9, chapter I, to change the address of the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service's central offices. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's central offices
in the Federal Building at 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD, are relocating to 4700 River Road, Riverdale, MD,
in January 1995. This final rule is necessary to announce the relocation and inform the public of the new address. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background 


The regulations in 7 CFR, chapter III, and 9 CFR, chapter I, govern animal and plant health. Prior to the effective date
of this document, these regulations indicated that certain forms and other information were available from and could
be sent to central offices of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in Hyattsville, MD. We are revising
7 CFR, chapter III, and 9 CFR, chapter I, to reflect the relocation of the APHIS central offices from Hyattsville, MD,
to Riverdale, MD. 
We are removing all references to the Hyattsville, MD, address and replacing them with references to the Riverdale,
MD, address. In addition we are making nonsubstantive wording changes for consistency. 
This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rulemaking
and opportunity to comment are not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

. Further, since this rule relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order
12886. Finally, this action is not a rule as defined by Public Law 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and
thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act. 


Miscellaneous 


In addition to the changes set forth above, we are making several nonsubstantive editorial changes to correct typographical
errors and minor editorial inconsistencies. In addition, we are amending  97.2, Commuted Traveltime Allowances
table, to reflect service for Dulles International Airport in Virginia from the regional office in Annapolis, MD,
rather than from Hyattsville, MD. The service time will not change; therefore, this is a nonsubstantive change. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.). 



Accordingly, we are amending 7 CFR parts 301, 318, 319, 322, 340, 352, 354, 355, 360, 370, and 371 and 9 CFR parts 2, 11,
50, 51, 54, 71, 72, 75, 77, 78, 79, 82, 85, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98, 102, 113, 114, 124, 130, 145, 147, 151, 166 as follows:




Title 7_Agriculture

Table Grapes Grown in Southeastern California and Table Grapes Imported into the United States; Revision in Minimum
Grade Requirements 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends the minimum quality requirements currently in effect for table grapes grown in southeastern
California under Marketing Order No. 925 and for table grapes imported into the United States. This final rule will
allow for the handling of grapes which satisfy all the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade except for
bunch size tolerance. The objective of this rule is to help handlers and importers market grapes which do not meet the
U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade because of a greater variance in bunch size.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 925 [7 CFR Part 925], regulating the handling of grapes
grown in a designated area of southeastern California. The marketing agreement and order are authorized under the
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the
Act. 


This final rule is also issued pursuant to section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue
grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities imported into the United States that
are the same as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities under Federal marketing orders. Table
grapes were added to the list of commodities specified in section 8e in 1982. 
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. 
There are approximately 20 handlers of California desert grapes subject to regulation under the marketing order,
and approximately 90 producers. In addition, there are approximately 70 importers of table grapes subject to the
requirements of the table grape import regulation. Small agricultural service firms, which include handlers and
importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts
of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than
$500,000. The majority of the table grape handlers, producers and importers may be classified as small entities.

Under the marketing order, table grapes grown in southeastern California are currently subject to a minimum grade
requirement of U.S. No. 1 or U.S. No. 1 Institutional, as set forth in the United States Standards for Grades of Table
Grapes (European or Vinifera Type) (Standards). The requirements of the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade are the same
as those of the U.S. No. 1 grade, with two exceptions. The first relates to bunch size. Under the U.S. No. 1 grade, there
is a minimum bunch size requirement of 4 ounces. Under the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade, bunches must weigh at least
2 ounces but not more than 5 ounces. The second difference is that at least 95 percent of the containers in a lot of grapes
grading U.S. No. 1 Institutional must be legibly marked ``Institutional Pack,'' whereas no such marking requirement
applies under the U.S. No. 1 grade. In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling, both grades
provide a tolerance of 8 percent for off-size 







bunches and for bunches and berries failing to meet other grade requirements. 



The California Desert Grape Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration
of the order, met on November 4, 1993, and unanimously recommended relaxing the quality requirements in the handling
regulations to allow an additional bunch size tolerance for grapes which would otherwise grade U.S. No. 1 Institutional.


This final rule provides an additional tolerance of 25 percent, or a total of 33 percent, for bunches of grapes that
would otherwise meet the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade. 

Prior to the 1992 season, the minimum grade requirement in effect under the order was U.S. No. 1 grade. The U.S. No. 1
Institutional grade was authorized as a means of allowing the industry to fulfill demands of the foodservice industry
(e.g., restaurants and schools) for smaller sized bunches of grapes than are preferred in other markets. However,
the domestic table grape industry has experienced difficulty in meeting the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 Institutional
grade due to the 8 percent tolerance for off-sized bunches. The committee believes that establishing an additional
tolerance for off-sized bunches in the handling regulation will promote sales of grapes packed for institutional
use. Due to the requirements of the current handling regulation, California table grape handlers are unable to ship
smaller grape bunches because of the 
8 percent off-size bunch tolerance of the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade. This has required handlers to repack grapes
after they have been packed in the vineyards, resulting in packing costs that are prohibitively high for the modest
prices paid by buyers of institutional grade grapes. Allowing an additional 25 percent bunch size tolerance is expected
to allow the industry to more fully utilize its grapes in the marketplace. This final rule allows handlers to mark containers
of grapes meeting the modified requirements as ``DGAC No. 1 Institutional.'' 

In accordance with section 8e of the Act, table grapes imported into the United States are subject to the same minimum
grade requirements as those in effect for domestically grown grapes under the marketing order. Those requirements
are found in Table Grape Import Regulation 4 
[7 CFR part 944.503]. Because this final rule will provide an additional tolerance for off-size bunches of grapes
under the domestic handling regulation, the same change is being made in the table grape import regulation. 

Finally, this rule will also update references to government contacts and sources of regulatory information in both
the domestic and import regulations. 

A proposed rule concerning this revision of minimum grade requirements was issued on July 11, 1994, and published
in the 

Federal Register

 on July 15, 1994, [59 FR 36091]. That rule provided a 15-day comment period which ended August 1, 1994. One comment was
received.

Mr. T. Albert Yamada of Masaoka & Associates, Inc. filed a comment on behalf of the Fresh Produce Association of
the Americas opposed to the committee's recommendation. Mr. Yamada contends that the proposed relaxation would
degrade the quality of grapes offered to the public, and allow sales of very small bunches regardless of the quality
of the individual grapes on the bunch. However, Marketing Order regulations will require that grapes grading U.S.
No. 1 Institutional under the relaxed bunch size tolerance meet the same quality requirements as before this relaxation.
This rule will not impact the quality of grapes. It will only affect the bunch size tolerance for grapes destined for
foodservice outlets. Therefore, the comment submitted by Mr. Yamada is denied.

Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted
by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of
this final rule.

User Fee Airports


<AGENCY>

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Customs Regulations to reflect the establishment of eight additional user fee airports.
User fee airports are those which, while not qualifying for designation as an international or landing rights airport,
have been approved by the Commissioner of Customs to receive the services of Customs officers for the processing of
aircraft entering the U. S. and their passengers and cargo.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Part 122, Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 122), sets forth regulations that are applicable to all international
air commerce relating to the entry and clearance of aircraft and the transportation of persons and cargo by aircraft.

Under  1109(b), Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1509(b)), the Secretary of the Treasury
is authorized to designate places in the United States as ports of entry for civil aircraft arriving from any place
outside of the United States, and for merchandise carried on the aircraft. These airports are referred to as international
airports, and the location and name of each are listed in  122.13, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 122.13). In accordance
with  122.33, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 122.33), the first landing of every civil aircraft entering the United
States from a foreign area must be at one of these international airports, unless the aircraft has been specifically
exempted from this requirement or permission to land elsewhere has been granted. Customs officers are assigned to
all international airports to accept entries of merchandise, collect duties and enforce the customs laws and regulations.

Other than if making an emergency or forced landing, if a civil aircraft desires to land at an airport not designated
by Customs as an international airport, the pilot may request permission to land at a specific airport and, if granted,
Customs assigns personnel to that airport for the aircraft. The airport where the aircraft is permitted to land is
called a landing rights airport (19 CFR 122.24). 
Section 236 of Pub. L. 98-573 (the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984), codified at 19 United States Code 58b (19 U.S.C.
58b), creates an option for civil aircraft desiring to land at an airport other than an international or landing rights
airport. A civil aircraft arriving from a place outside the United States may ask Customs for permission to land at
an airport designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as a user fee airport.

Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 58b, an airport may be designated as a user fee airport if the Secretary of the Treasury determines
that the volume of Customs business at the airport is insufficient to justify the availability of Customs services
at the airport and the governor of the state in which the airport is located approves the designation. Generally, the
type of airport that would seek designation as a user fee airport would be one at which a company, such as an air courier
service, has a specialized interest in regularly landing. 
Inasmuch as the volume of business anticipated at these airports is insufficient to justify their designation as
an international or landing rights airport, the availability of Customs services is not paid for out of the Customs
appropriations from the general treasury of the United States. Instead, the services of Customs officers are provided
on a fully reimbursable basis to be paid for by the user fee airports on behalf of the recipients of the services. 
The fees which are to be charged at user fee airports, according to the statute, shall be paid by each person using the
Customs services at the airport and shall be in the amount equal to the expenses incurred by the Secretary of the Treasury
in providing Customs services which are rendered to such person at such airport, including the salary and expenses
of those employed by the Secretary of the Treasury to provide the Customs services. To implement this provision, generally
the airport seeking the designation as a user fee airport or that airport's authority agrees to pay Customs a flat fee
annually and the users of the airport are to reimburse that airport/airport authority. The airport/airport authority
agrees to set and periodically to review its charges to ensure that they are in accord with the airport's expenses.

Pursuant to Treasury Department Order No. 165, Revised (Treasury Decision 53564), all the rights, privileges, powers
and duties vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, by the navigation laws, or by
any other laws administered by Customs, are transferred to the Commissioner of Customs. Accordingly, the authority
granted to the Secretary of the Treasury to designate user fee airports and to determine appropriate fees is delegated
to the Commissioner of Customs. 
Under this authority, Customs has determined that certain conditions must be met before an airport can be designated
as a user fee airport. At least one full-time Customs officer must be requested, and the airport must be responsible
for providing Customs with satisfactory office space, equipment and supplies, at no cost to the Federal Government.

Nineteen airports are currently listed in  122.15, Customs Regulations, as user fee airports designated by
the Commissioner. This document adds eight more airports to the listing of designated user fee airports. These airports
and phone numbers at which they can be contacted regarding service are as follows:

Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866



Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this final rule, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), do not apply. Agency organization matters such as this amendment are exempt from consideration
under Executive Order 12866. 


Inapplicability of Public Notice and Delayed Effective Date Requirements


Because this amendment merely lists those user fee airports designated by the Commissioner of Customs in accordance
with 19 U.S.C. 58b and neither imposes any additional burdens on, nor takes away any existing rights or privileges
from, the public, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), notice and public procedure are unnecessary, and for the same reasons,
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2), a delayed effective date is not required.

 The Commission is amending certain rules of practice and procedure to implement amendments to section 337 of the Tariff
Act of 1930 enacted by Congress as part of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. By implementing the law, the rules bring
U.S. procedures into conformity with national treatment obligations under GATT, while providing for the effective
enforcement of intellectual property rights at the border.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



In 1989, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) adopted a report finding that USITC procedures in investigations
under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 violated GATT ``national treatment'' rules. The report listed several
ways in which imported goods are treated less favorably in Commission investigations than domestic goods are treated
in district court infringement cases. In the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Congress amended section 337 to bring
USITC procedures into compliance with the GATT ``national treatment'' rules. See H. Rep. No. 103-826, 103d
Cong., 2d Sess. 140-142 (1994). The amendments, and the interim rule revisions that follow, focus on changes
in four areas that respond to GATT criticisms: 




time limits for concluding an investigation have been eliminated and a procedure for establishing a ``target date''
for completion has been adopted instead; 

respondents are given the opportunity to stay parallel actions in district court while a Commission investigation
is proceeding; the Commission's record may be used subsequently in the district court; 

limitations are placed on the Commission's ability to issue ``general'' exclusion orders; and 

respondents are permitted to file counterclaims at the Commission; these claims will be heard by a district court,
but the same subject matter may be considered as part of an affirmative defense at the Commission. 




Other amendments bring Commission practice into closer conformity with district court practice with respect to
bonding requirements and the deference accorded to arbitration agreements. 



The Procedure for Adopting Interim Rules 



The URAA was enacted on December 8, 1994. This legislation contains provisions which, 

inter alia,

 amend section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337). The Commission's rules concerning Section 337 practice
and procedure need to be amended to conform to the new legislation. 

Commission rules to implement new legislation ordinarily are promulgated in accordance with the rulemaking provisions
of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551 

et seq.

), which entails the following steps: (1) Publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking; (2) solicitation of public
comment on the proposed rules; (3) Commission review of such comments prior to developing final rules; and (4) publication
of the final rules thirty days prior to their effective date. See 5 U.S.C. 553. That procedure could not be utilized
in this instance because the new legislation was enacted on December 8, 1994, and will become effective, with respect
to the amendments to section 337 of the Act, on January 1, 1995, the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into force
with respect to the United States, unless the United States Trade Representative announces prior to that date that
the WTO Agreement will not enter into force on that date. These interim rules apply to section 337 complaints filed
on or after the effective date. It was consequently not possible to complete the section 553 rulemaking procedure
prior to the effective date of the new legislation.

The Commission thus determined to adopt interim rules that will go into effect when the provisions of the URAA amending
section 337 become effective and will remain in effect until the Commission can adopt final rules promulgated in accordance
with the usual notice, comment, and advance publication procedure. 

The Commission's authority to adopt interim rules without following all steps listed in section 553 of the APA is derived
from three sources: (1) Section 335 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1335); (2) section 103 of the URAA and the Statement of Administrative
Action approved by the URAA; and (3) provisions of section 553 of the APA which allow an agency to dispense with various
steps in the prescribed rulemaking procedure under certain circumstances. 

Section 335 of the Act authorizes the Commission ``to adopt such reasonable procedures and rules and regulations
as it deems necessary to carry out its functions and duties.'' 19 U.S.C. 1335. Similarly, section 103(a) of the URAA
authorizes federal agencies to ``issue such regulations as may be necessary to ensure that any provision of this Act,
or amendment made by this Act, that takes effect on the date [of] any of the Uruguay Round Agreements entered into force
with respect to the United States is appropriately implemented on such date,'' and section 103(b) of the URAA directs
that ``[a]ny interim regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out any action proposed in the statement of administrative
action approved under section 101 [of the URAA] to implement an agreement described in section 101(d) (7), (12), or
(13) [of the URAA] be issued not later than 1 year after the date on which the agreement enters into force with respect
to the United States.'' 

The Commission determined that the need for interim rules is clear in this instance. The Commission noted that the
new legislation alters section 337 practice and procedure and that the existing Commission rules do not encompass
certain procedures required by the new legislation. The Commission found that rulemaking was essential for the orderly
administration of section 337 as amended by the new legislation. Furthermore, since the legislation was to become
effective very shortly after enactment, the Commission concluded that it was imperative that implementing rules
be in place on the effective date of the new statute. 

The Commission noted that an agency may dispense with publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking when the following
circumstances exist: (1) The proposed rules are interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency
organization, procedure or practice; or (2) the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon
are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and that finding (and the reasons therefor)
are incorporated into the rules adopted by the agency. 5 U.S.C. 553(b). An agency may also dispense with the publication
of a notice of final rules thirty days prior to their effective date if (1) the rules are interpretive rules of statements
of policy or (2) the agency finds that ``good cause'' exists for not meeting the advance publication requirement and
that finding is published along with the rule 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). 

In this instance, the Commission determined that the requisite circumstances existed for dispensing with the notice,
comment, and advance publication procedure that ordinarily precedes the adoption of Commission rules. For purposes
of invoking the section 553(b) exemption from publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking which solicits public comment,
the Commission found that (1) the interim rules are ``agency rules of procedure or practice''; and (2) since the new
legislation is projected to become effective very shortly after enactment, and the time or fact of enactment could
not be predicted in advance, it clearly would be ``impracticable'' for the Commission to comply with the usual notice,
comment, and advance publication procedure. For the purpose of invoking the section 553(d)(3) exemption from publishing
advance notice of the interim rules thirty days prior to their effective date, the Commission found that the fact that
the new legislation is expected to become effective very shortly after enactment made such advance publication impossible
and constituted ``good cause'' for the Commission not to comply with that requirement.

The Commission recognizes that interim regulations should not respond to anything more than the exigencies created
by the new legislation. Having been promulgated in response to exigencies created by the new legislation, each interim
rule accordingly comes under one or more of the following categories: (1) Revision of a pre-existing rule that conflicted
with the new legislation; (2) a technical amendment to make a pre-existing rule conform to the language of the new legislation;
(3) rewording of a pre-existing rule to avoid confusion about how the rule is to be applied in light of the new legislation;
or (4) a new rule covering a matter provided for in the new legislation but not covered by a pre-existing rule. More comprehensive
final rules will be issued at a later date in accordance with the usual notice, public comment, and advance publication
procedure. 


Because the interim regulations merely respond to exigencies created by the new legislation, the Commission has
further determined that they do not meet the criteria described in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735,
Oct. 4, 1993), and thus do not constitute a significant regulatory action for purposes of the EO. In accordance with
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 note), the Commission hereby certifies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that
the rules set forth in this notice are not likely to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small business
entities. In any event, the Regulatory Flexibility Act is inapplicable to this rulemaking because it is not one in
which a notice of proposed rulemaking is required under 5 U.S.C. 553(b). 




Section-By-Section Analysis of the Interim Rules 

Subpart A_Rules of General Applicability 



Section 210.3 



The definition of ``investigation'' is revised to eliminate a reference to designating the permanent relief phase
of an investigation ``more complicated.'' See discussion of  210.22 below. 



Section 210.4 



Paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) has been revised to indicate that a termination based on an arbitration agreement joins
terminations based on settlement agreements and consent order agreements in a category of cases in which monetary
sanctions may be imposed on the initiative of the administrative law judge or the Commission. 



Section 210.5 



Paragraph (b) is revised to conform to amended 19 U.S.C. 1337(n)(2), which clarifies the list of government officers
and employees who may have access to confidential business information. 

A new paragraph (c) is added to alert the reader to the possibility that confidential business information may be transmitted
to a federal district court, subject to such protective order as the district court determines necessary. This result
might occur in a limited class of cases because of newly-enacted 28 U.S.C. 1659. Past Commission practice has been
to permit the transfer of confidential business information to another court only with permission of the supplier
of the information. Particularly where the supplier is a third party who is involved in neither the Commission investigation
nor the district court case, it is important that the supplier be made aware that treatment of confidential information
would be governed by the district court's protective order and not that of the Commission following transmittal of
the record under this provision. It is expected that future protective orders will refer to this rule and the similar
provision in  210.39(b) to assure that all suppliers of confidential business information are aware of this
possibility. 

The remaining two paragraphs of this section are redesignated (d) and (e). 



Subpart C_Pleadings 



Section 210.14

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941230-0-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941230-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A new paragraph (e) is added to implement the amendment to 19 U.S.C. 1337(c) with regard to counterclaims. The rule
requires that counterclaims be filed not later than ten business days before the commencement of the evidentiary
hearing. This requirement should provide a respondent adequate discovery time to identify potential counterclaims
while avoiding the distraction that might occur if counterclaims could be filed during (or after) the evidentiary
hearing. For reasons of clarity, the rule requires counterclaims to be filed in a separate document. 
The statutory amendment makes clear that the new procedures with respect to counterclaims do not affect the ability
of a respondent to present all legal or equitable defenses that may be available to it in a section 337 investigation.
Action on the counterclaim will not delay or affect the Commission's proceeding. The Commission is not precluded
from considering judicial rulings on counterclaims as part of the Commission's consideration of the effect of a remedial
order on the public interest. See H.R. Rep. No. 103-826, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 141 (1994). 


Subpart D_Motions 


Section 210.16 


Paragraph (c)(2) is revised to include by reference the requirements added to  210.50(c) below with regard
to criteria that must be considered by the Commission before issuing a general exclusion order. 


Section 210.21 


A new paragraph (d) is added to implement the amendment to 19 U.S.C. 1337(c) that permits the Commission to terminate
an investigation on the basis of an agreement between the private parties to present the matter for arbitration, as
well as the traditional settlement agreement. The procedures to be followed with respect to a motion to terminate
on the basis of an arbitration agreement are similar to those pertaining to settlement agreements under paragraph
(b) of this section. 
Paragraph (a)(2) is revised to include a reference to the new paragraph (d), and the previous paragraph (d) is redesignated
(e). 


Section 210.22 


Amendments to 19 U.S.C. 1337(b) eliminated time limits for concluding the permanent relief phase of an investigation
under section 337. The provision for a ``more complicated'' designation resulting in an 18-month deadline was eliminated.
Instead, the Commission is directed to establish a ``target date'' in each investigation. The procedure for establishing
a target date is discussed with respect to  210.51 below. 
This section is amended by deleting paragraph (b) with respect to a ``more complicated'' designation of the permanent
relief phase of an investigation. The previous paragraph (c) is redesignated (b) and is otherwise unchanged. This
paragraph deals with declaring the temporary relief phase of an investigation ``more complicated,'' a procedure
that was unchanged by the statutory amendments. 


Section 210.23 


This section is revised to reflect amendments to 19 U.S.C. 1337(b)(1), which eliminate the authority of the Commission
to suspend an investigation ``because of proceedings in a court or agency of the United States involving similar questions
concerning the subject matter'' of the investigation. The Commission retains the authority to suspend an investigation
pending review by the Department of Commerce of possible antidumping or countervailing duty matters referred to
the Department of Commerce by the Commission pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1337(b)(3), and the rule is revised to reflect this
retained authority. 
The need for an investigation to be suspended no longer exists insofar as the statutory deadline for concluding the
permanent relief phase has been eliminated. Circumstances that would have warranted suspension under the old rules
may warrant an extension of the target date for completing the investigation under these amendments. With respect
to the temporary relief phase of an investigation, however, the elimination of authority to suspend is significant,
because the strict statutory deadlines for deciding petitions for temporary relief have been retained. Temporary
relief proceedings now must proceed to completion regardless of concurrent parallel proceedings in other courts
or agencies (except for the rare proceeding at the Department of Commerce, referred to in the preceding paragraph).
If a complainant pursues a motion for temporary relief under circumstances that would have resulted in suspension
under the Commission's prior practice, there may be a basis for requiring a more substantial bond from the complainant
before temporary relief is ordered. 


Section 210.24 


Paragraph (a)(2) is deleted because ``more complicated'' designations have been eliminated with respect to permanent
relief. Paragraph (a)(3) is redesignated (a)(2). 
Paragraph (b)(2) is revised to reflect the renumbering of the paragraphs in  210.5. 


Subpart F_Prehearing Conferences and Hearings 


Section 210.39 


A new paragraph (b) is added and the succeeding paragraphs are redesignated. The addition outlines the circumstances
in which the Commission's record, including the in camera record, may be transmitted to a federal district court,
subject to such protective order as the district court determines necessary. As in  210.5, discussed above,
this rule alerts the reader that treatment of confidential business information would be governed by the district
court's protective order following transmittal of the Commission's record to the court.

Subpart G_Determinations and Actions Taken 


Section 210.41 


This section is revised to conform the cross-references to amended  210.21. 


Section 210.42 


Paragraph (a)(1)(i) is revised to establish new time frames in which the initial determination on violation must
be filed. If the target date for completing the permanent relief phase of the investigation is set at 15 months or less,
the initial determination is to be filed three months before the target date. If the target date is more than 15 months,
the initial determination is to be filed four months before the target date. (The procedure for establishing the target
date is found in  210.51, discussed below.) 
Paragraphs (b) and (c) are revised to reflect the amendment of  210.70 to include the return as well as possible
forfeiture of a complainant's temporary relief bond. Paragraph (c) is further revised to include initial determinations
that may be issued in two new situations: in granting a motion for forfeiture or return of respondents' bonds pursuant
to  210.50(d) and in granting a motion to set a target date exceeding 15 months from the date of institution pursuant
to  210.51(a). 
Paragraph (h)(3) is revised to give initial determinations issued pursuant to  210.50(d)(3) the same status
as those issued pursuant to  210.70(c). The effect of the exception expressed in this paragraph is to give a 45-day
effective date rather than a 30-day effective date to initial determinations granting motions for forfeiture or
return of either complainants' or respondents' bonds. 


Section 210.43 


Paragraphs (a)(1) and (d) are revised to refer to initial determinations issued under new  210.50(d) and to
put these initial determinations on the same footing as those issued under  210.70(c). 


Section 210.49 


Paragraph (a) is revised to conform the cross-references to amended  210.21. 


Section 210.50 


Paragraph (a)(3) is revised to implement the specific statutory direction that the Commission determine the amount
of a respondent's bond ``sufficient to protect the complainant from any injury.'' 19 U.S.C. 1337(e) and (j)(3). The
Commission expects to construe this direction on a case-by-case basis. Language referring to past Commission practice
in determining the amount of a respondent's bond has been deleted. 
Paragraph (b)(2) is revised to conform the cross-references to amended  210.21. 
Paragraph (c) is new and implements the statutory limitations on issuance of a general exclusion order found in 19
U.S.C. 1337(d)(2). These limitations are consonant with past Commission practice as articulated in 

Certain Airless Paint Spray Pumps and Components Thereof, 

Inv. No. 337-TA-90 (USITC Pub. 1199, Nov. 1981) and cases following it. The Commission expects the law
in this area to continue to develop on a case-by-case basis in view of the new statutory language. 
Paragraph (d) is new and implements the statutory requirement that the Commission prescribe terms and conditions
under which bonds may be forfeited. 19 U.S.C. 1337(e)(4) and (j)(3). The terms of this rule are essentially similar
to those in  210.70 relating to the forfeiture or return of a complainant's temporary relief bond. Both rules
implement the Congressional mandate that the Commission be guided by practice under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure with respect to forfeiture of a complainant's bond. H.R. Rep. No. 103-826, 103d Cong., 2d Sess.
142 (1994). Although Federal Rule 65 literally applies to bonding by the proponent of temporary relief, its underlying
rationale is equally applicable to respondents' bonds in section 337 investigations. ``Practice under Rule 65''
includes all sources of authority pertaining to Rule 65 that are generally relied on in the practice of law, including
(but not limited to) judicial decisions and notes of the advisory committee on rules. Treatises and commentary also
may be considered.

Section 210.51 


Congress amended 19 U.S.C. 1337(b) to eliminate the time limit for completing an investigation, but directed that
the Commission complete an investigation and make its determination ``at the earliest practicable time.'' Section
210.51(a) is revised to reflect this change and to implement the requirement that the Commission, within 45 days after
an investigation is instituted, set a target date for completion of the investigation. The rule allows the administrative
law judge to set (and modify) the target date in a final order not subject to review as long as the target date does not
exceed 15 months from the date of institution. Target dates exceeding 15 months are set in initial determinations,
reviewable by the Commission. The Commission expects that most investigations will be concluded within the traditional
time frame of 12 months or less. Deadlines for various activities pertaining to section 337 investigations have been
retained in the rules unless specifically amended herein. 
Paragraph (c) is revised to reflect the elimination of the Commission's authority to suspend an investigation except
as set forth in  210.23. 


Subpart H_Temporary Relief 


Section 210.52 


Paragraph (c) is revised to indicate that the Commission will be guided by Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
in determining whether to require a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of temporary relief, as mandated by the legislative
history of the statutory amendments. H.R. Rep. No. 103-826, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 142 (1994). The factors relied
upon by the Commission in its past practice are deleted from paragraphs (c) and (e), and paragraph (f) is redesignated
as (e). 


Section 210.70 


Paragraph (a) is revised to reflect the statutory change authorizing forfeiture of the complainant's temporary
relief bond to the respondent and to authorize the complainant to file a motion for the return of its bond when appropriate.

Paragraph (c) is revised to indicate that the Commission will be guided by practice under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure in determining whether to require a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of temporary relief,
as mandated by the legislative history of the statutory amendments. H.R. Rep. No. 103-826, 103d Cong., 2d Sess.
142 (1994). ``Practice under Rule 65'' includes all sources of authority pertaining to Rule 65 that are generally
relied on in the practice of law, including (but not limited to) judicial decisions and notes of the advisory committee
on rules. Treatises and commentary also may be considered. 
Because forfeiture of a bond posted by a complainant now will be to the respondent rather than the government, the provision
in the prior rule allowing a motion for forfeiture to be made by the Commission investigative attorney or by the Commission
is deleted. Consistent with practice under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a respondent seeking forfeiture
would be required to show the costs and damages incurred as a result of the imposition of temporary relief. The respondent
itself is in the best position to make this showing and should bear the responsibility of filing a motion for forfeiture
of a bond when appropriate. 
The former provision precluding a stay of forfeiture proceedings pending appeal of the Commission's determination
on violation also is deleted in view of the statutory change. A stay may or may not be appropriate depending on the facts
of each case, including the ability of a respondent to repay an amount forfeited to it in the event of a reversal on appeal.

Termination based upon arbitration agreement. 

Upon filing of a motion for termination to the administrative law judge or the Commission, a section 337 investigation
may be terminated as to one or more respondents pursuant to section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 on the basis of an
agreement between complainant and one or more of the respondents to present the matter for arbitration. The motion
and a copy of the arbitration agreement shall be certified by the administrative law judge to the Commission with an
initial determination if the motion for termination is granted. If the agreement or the initial determination contains
confidential business information, copies of the agreement and initial determination with confidential business
information deleted shall be certified to the Commission with the confidential versions of such documents. The Commission
shall publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 stating that an initial determination has been received, that nonconfidential versions of the initial determination
and the agreement are available for inspection in the Office of the Secretary, and that interested persons may submit
written comments concerning termination of the respondents in question within 10 days of the date of publication
of the notice in the 

Federal Register

. An order of termination based on an arbitration agreement does not constitute a determination as to violation of
section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Sunset Beach, NC


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

At the request of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the Coast Guard is changing the regulations that
govern the operation of the drawbridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 337.9, at Sunset Beach, North
Carolina. This rule will restrict bridge openings in the month of November to help reduce highway traffic congestion
problems, public safety, and welfare concerns associated with frequent bridge openings caused by recreational
boat traffic. This rule is intended to provide for regularly scheduled drawbridge openings to help reduce motor vehicle
traffic delays and congestion on the roads and highways linked by this drawbridge.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

.



Drafting information: The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Linda L. Gilliam, Project Manager,
Bridge Section, and LCDR C.A. Abel, Project Counsel, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Regulatory History


On September 7, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway,
Sunset Beach, North Carolina, in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 46209). The comment period ended November 7, 1994. The Coast Guard received no comments on the proposal. The
Commander, Fifth Coast Guard District, also published the proposed rule as a public notice on October 14, 1994, with
the comment period ending November 17, 1994, and no comments were received as a result of this notice. A public hearing
was not requested and one was not held.


Background and Purpose


The North Carolina Department of Transportation has requested, on behalf of the Town of Sunset Beach, North Carolina,
that openings of the drawbridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 337.9, at Sunset Beach, North Carolina,
be further restricted through the month of November. This would help to reduce highway traffic congestion problems,
public safety, and welfare concerns associated with frequent bridge openings caused by recreational boat traffic.
Currently, the drawbridge opens on the hour from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. for pleasure vessels from April 1 to October 31. It opens
on signal at any time for vessels of the United States, State and local government vessels, commercial vessels, and
any vessel in an emergency involving danger to life or property. This rule extends this schedule to November 30 with
drawbridge openings occurring on the hour from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
The North Carolina Department of Transportation conducted a study of the drawlogs for this drawbridge for the month
of November and it revealed that the drawbridge opened 558 times in 1992 and 571 times in 1993. These openings exceeded
the openings for every other month during the same years. Based on this information, the Coast Guard believes these
regulations will permit an orderly flow of recreational vessel traffic through the draw. This should not unduly restrict
recreational vessel passage through the bridge, since they can plan their vessel transits around the hourly restriction.

Regulatory Evaluation



This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this final rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under
5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This final rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq

.).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principals and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it
has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.e.(32)(e)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.



List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117



Bridges.



Regulations



In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard is amending Part 117 of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations to
read as follows:



PART 117_DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS



1. The authority citation for Part 117 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 33 U.S.C. 499; 49 CFR 1.46; 33 CFR 1.05-1(g).




2. In Section 117.821 paragraph (b)(5) is revised to read as follows:

Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Albemarle Sound to Sunset Beach.



 * * * * *



(b) * * *

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Chesapeake, VA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

At the request of the City of Chesapeake, Virginia the Coast Guard is changing the regulations that govern the operation
of the drawbridge across the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 5.8, at
Chesapeake, Virginia, by limiting bridge openings during the morning and evening rush hours. This rule will allow
commercial cargo vessels, tugs, and tugs with tows passage through the bridge during morning and evening rush hours,
provided a 2-hour advance notice is given to the Gilmerton Bridge. This rule also includes a provision that allows
public vessels of the United States, vessels in distress, commercial vessels carrying liquefied flammable gas or
other harmful substances, and commercial or public vessels assisting in an emergency situation passage through
the bridge at any time. All other commercial and recreational vessel traffic will be denied draw openings during the
morning and evening rush hours. The changes to these regulations are, to the extent practical and feasible, intended
to provide for regularly scheduled drawbridge openings to help reduce motor vehicle traffic delays and congestion
on the roads and highways linked by this drawbridge while providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Request for Comments



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD05-94-103)
and the specific section of this rule to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. The Coast
Guard requests that all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound format suitable for copying and electronic
filing. If not practical, a second copy of any bound material is requested. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt
of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

comments.

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Commander (ob) at the
address under ADDRESSES

. The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral
presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by
a later notice in the 

Federal Register.

Background and Purpose



The City of Chesapeake, Virginia has requested that openings of the Gilmerton Highway drawbridge across the 
Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, Atlantic 
Intracoastal Waterway, mile 5.8, at Chesapeake, Virginia, be 
limited during the morning and evening rush hours. This 
would help reduce highway traffic congestion problems and 
address public safety and welfare concerns associated with 
frequent bridge openings caused by recreational and 
commercial boat traffic. The City of Chesapeake's request 
is based on the increase in highway traffic crossing the 
Gilmerton Bridge occurring as a result of the emergency 
closing to highway traffic of the Jordan Bridge located 
downriver at mile 2.8. When the Jordan Bridge experienced a 
sudden mechanical malfunction on May 10, 1994, this vertical 
lift bridge was raised to the fully opened to river traffic 
position in order not to block use of the waterway by the 
heavy commercial and recreational traffic routinely 
transitting the Intracoastal Waterway. As a result of 
locking the bridge in the open position until further 
notice, the highway traffic that had been using the Jordan 
Bridge was diverted to the Gilmerton Bridge. The increase 
in highway congestion and lengthy delays across the bridge 
caused by the Jordan Bridge's closure, coupled with random, 
non-scheduled drawbridge openings for the many commercial 
and recreational vessels using the Intracoastal Waterway 
in this area warrants the need to change the operating schedule 
for this bridge.

Currently, the drawbridge opens on demand, 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. This rule will limit bridge openings
between the hours of 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. and from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
Commercial cargo vessels, tugs, and tugs with tows will be allowed passage through the bridge during the morning and
evening rush hours, provided a 2-hour advance notice is given to the Gilmerton Bridge.

Public vessels of the United States, vessels in 
distress, commercial vessels carrying liquefied flammable 
gas or other harmful substances, and commercial or public 
vessels assisting in an emergency situation will be allowed 
passage through the bridge at any time. Recreational 
vessels and all other commercial vessels will not be allowed 
passage through the bridge during the morning and evening 
rush hours. 

The decision to allow liquefied flammable gas carriers 
access through the bridge at any time with no restrictions 
was made based on the hazards involved in shipping liquefied 
flammable gas and to maintain safety along the Southern 
Branch of the Elizabeth River. It has been determined by 
the Coast Guard that since tugs and tugs with tows have no 
place to tie up in the proximity of the bridge to wait for a 
bridge opening, it was necessary to include them in the 2-hour 
advance notice requirement provision. Commercial cargo 
vessels, requiring high tide to transit this river also are 
included in the 2-hour advance notice requirement provision. 

The Gilmerton Bridge is a vital link between the cities 
of Portsmouth and Chesapeake used widely by motorists that 
work at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, other Federal agencies 
located within the Shipyard, as well as within Portsmouth, 
and other industries and businesses in Portsmouth and 
Chesapeake, Virginia. It appears the need to limit bridge 
openings during peak rush hours far outweighs any need to 
maintain the Gilmerton Bridge at its present ``open on 
demand'' schedule. On November 2, 1994, the Coast Guard met 
with the Hampton Roads Maritime Association to discuss 
changing the regulations on the Gilmerton Bridge and the 
reasons why restricting this bridge during the morning and 
evening rush hours was necessary. The Hampton Roads 
Maritime Association considered the current condition of the 
Jordan Bridge and they supported the plan to regulate the 
Gilmerton Bridge to accommodate the additional vehicle 
traffic being diverted from the Jordan Bridge.

The Coast Guard believes these restrictions will not unduly restrict vessel passage through the bridge, as vessel
operators and the marine industry have agreed to and can plan transits around the interim schedule. Due to the unexpected
closure of the Jordan Bridge to highway traffic, the Coast Guard believes it is in the public interest to regulate the
Gilmerton Bridge; therefore, good cause exists for publishing this rule without prior notice and opportunity for
comment, and making it effective in less than the 30 days after publication normally required. This rule should be
effective immediately because it is in the overall public interest to do so, and the Coast Guard is not aware of any reasons
not to.


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the U.S. Coast Guard must consider whether the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice
of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses
that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore,
is exempt from the regulatory flexibility requirements. Although exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed this rule
for potential impact on small entities. Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies
under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
If, however, you think that your business qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have a significant economic
impact on your business, please submit a comment (see 

ADDRESSES

) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this rule will affect your business
economically.


Collection of Information


This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).


Federalism


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principals and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.e(32)(e)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

Ballast Water Management for Vessels Entering the Hudson River 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard is issuing regulations to implement an amendment to the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention
and Control Act of 1990 (the Act). The regulations require ballast water management practices for each vessel entering
the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating on waters beyond the Exclusive Economic
Zone. These rules will help to prevent the additional introduction of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species into
the Great Lakes through the ballast water of vessels operating on the Hudson River.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Drafting Information 


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Jonathan C. Burton, Project Manager, Marine
Environmental Protection Division, and Ms. Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. 


Regulatory History 


On June 21, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Ballast Water Management for
Vessels Entering the Hudson River'' in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 31959). The Coast Guard received no letters commenting on the proposal. No public hearing was requested, and
none was held. 



Background and Purpose 


Historical records suggest that over 100 non-native species have been introduced into the Great Lakes and its tributaries.
The primary medium for their introduction is believed to be ballast water from vessels. Many vessels take on water
in foreign harbors or in the near shore waters which are often rich in living organisms. When these vessels arrive to
take on cargo, they discharge ballast water and any organisms contained in the water enter the 
local ecosystem. While many of these species do not survive in this new environment, those that do quickly adapt, and
in some instances thrive, particularly where there are no natural predators. 
The Zebra Mussel provides a good example of the harmful effects of a newly introduced species. In 1988, this small bivalve
mollusk native to the Black, Azov, and Caspian Seas in the Ukraine and southern Russia, was discovered in the Western
Basin of Lake Erie. Scientists believe that it was introduced in 1986 by the discharge of freshwater ballast of a vessel
from Northern Europe. Hundreds of millions of Zebra Mussels can now be found on and in pipes, screens, conduits, boat
bottoms, floats, buoys, rocks, submerged objects, and native animals and plants. As a filter feeding organism, it
removes vast quantities of microscopic organisms from the water, the same organisms that fish larvae and young fish
rely upon for their food supply. It also completely covers rocks and other substances normally used by native fish
for laying eggs. Since its introduction into the Great Lakes the Zebra Mussel has reproduced and spread throughout
the Great Lakes and its tributaries and has been found as far south as New Orleans.

The Coast Guard issued ballast water control regulations on April 8, 1993, for vessels entering the Great Lakes after
operating beyond the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Such vessels are required to exchange their ballast water beyond
the EEZ. While the regulations are viewed as an excellent start toward addressing the nonindigenous aquatic nuisance
species introduction problem, Congress now realizes that it is necessary to implement ballast water controls for
vessels entering the Hudson River after operating beyond the EEZ. The Hudson River is connected to the Great Lakes
through the New York State Barge Canal System which allows for the movement of commercial and recreational vessels
throughout waterways of New York State and provides direct access to the Great Lakes. As a result of this connection,
species released from vessels' ballast water into the Hudson River can migrate, or can be transferred by vessels navigating
the canal system into the Great Lakes.



Solutions



Congress has noted that high seas ballast exchange is ``not a panacea'' for prevention of unintentional introductions
of nonindigenous aquatic species. Other means of infestation such as attachment to anchor chains and vessel hulls
contribute to infiltration. Moreover, the effects of ballast water exchange on high seas and coastal ecosystems
are not yet completely known. Nevertheless, ballast water exchange currently appears to be the most cost and labor
effective means of reducing the probability of new infestations. Alternative approaches may be warranted in some
situations, or may replace ballast exchange entirely, depending upon knowledge obtained through a Task Force set
up by the Act.



International Recognition



The need for control of the introduction of nonindigenous species has also been recognized by the international maritime
community. The ballast water control regulations for vessels entering the Great Lakes that were issued by the Coast
Guard on April 8, 1993, in large part, were based on ballast water control guidelines adopted by the Marine Environment
Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization at its 31st session in July 1991. The resolution
(MEPC 50(31)) which accompanied the issuance of the guidelines recommends that member countries issue guidelines
for the control of nonindigenous species into their ports.



United States Legislation



On November 4, 1992, Congress amended (Pub. L. 102-587) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and
Control Act of 1990 (the Act) (16 U.S.C. 4711(b)). This amendment extends the Act's applicability to vessels entering
the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. The Act, as amended, attempts
to prevent the spread of injurious nonindigenous species into the Great Lakes through the ballast water of these vessels.
The Act mandates that the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Task Force created by the Act, issue regulations to
prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes through the ballast water of vessels
entering a U.S. port, north of the George Washington Bridge, on the Hudson River, after operating beyond the EEZ.

The current regulations contained in 33 CFR part 151, subpart C, issued under the Act, cover vessels entering the Great
Lakes after operating beyond the EEZ and require the retention of ballast water or the exchange of ballast water beyond
the EEZ, by vessels subject to the Act. Further, as authorized under the Act, those regulations permit the use of environmentally
sound alternative ballast water management methods that the Coast Guard determines are as effective as ballast water
exchange in preventing and controlling infestations of aquatic nuisance species, thereby providing the needed
flexibility to approve additional ballast water management methods that, in the future, may prove to be even more
effective than ballast water exchange. These requirements, as well as the other requirements contained in subpart
C of part 151, will satisfy the requirements of the amendments to the Act if applied to vessels navigating on the Hudson
River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. Therefore, few changes to the regulations
issued by the Coast Guard on April 8, 1993, covering vessels entering a U.S. port on the Great Lakes after operating
beyond the EEZ, are required to implement the requirements of the amendments to the Act.

The Act provides for civil and criminal penalties (16 U.S.C. 4711 (c) and (d)). Any person who violates the regulations
shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000. Each day of a continuing violation will constitute a separate
violation. A vessel operated in violation of the regulations will be liable in rem for any civil penalty assessed for
that violation. Any person who knowingly violates the regulations will be guilty of a class C felony. A class C felony
is punishable by imprisonment of not more than 12 years (18 U.S.C. 3581(b)(3)) and a fine of not more than $250,000 for
an individual or not more than $500,000 for an organization (18 U.S.C. 3571(c)(3)).



Discussion of Comments and Changes



The Coast Guard received no public comments on the proposed rule. This final rule adopts the proposed regulations
without change.



Regulatory Evaluation



This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).

No comments were received on the draft Regulatory Evaluation. A final Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e
of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared and is available in the docket for inspection or
copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES. 

The Evaluation is summarized as follows.

In 1992, 112 visits were made by vessels to the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating
beyond the EEZ. The most recent data available from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concerning Hudson River vessel
traffic reveals that vessels operating on the Hudson River after operating beyond the EEZ are primarily foreign importer
vessels. Vessels carrying cargo, such as vessels engaged in importing, are generally not carrying ballast water.
These vessels do not have to comply with the regulations. Vessels carrying ballast, but not discharging it, are only
subject to the recordkeeping requirements. The Coast Guard has identified no vessels that have actually discharged
ballast into the Hudson River. Therefore, the only aspect of the regulations that these vessels will be subject to
is the recordkeeping requirements of 33 CFR 151.1516. It is estimated that it takes one half hour to complete. At the
cost of $35.00 per half hour and assuming 120 visits by vessels subject to these regulations, the annual cost will be
$4,200. 


Small Entities 


No comments were received on the affect of these regulations on small entities. Owners of vessels that will be engaging
in ballast water management in the affected area are large corporations. No small entities have been identified as
being affected. The economic affect on all entities will be minimal. No U.S. vessels have been identified as being
subject to the regulations. The total cost per vessel has been determined to be $35 per visit for each vessel with a total
annual cost in 1995 of $4,200 for all vessels. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Collection of Information 


This rule contains collection-of-information requirements. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

), and OMB has approved them. The section number is  151.1516 and the corresponding OMB approval number is OMB
Control Number 2115-0598.

No comments were received on the Federalism implications of this rule. The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule
under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The authority to issue regulations requiring ballast water management practices for vessels navigating the Hudson
River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ, has been committed to the Coast Guard
by the Act. Standardizing the minimum requirements for these vessels is necessary to effectively prevent further
introductions of nonindigenous species. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt state and local regulations
that are inconsistent with the requirements of this final rule. These regulations were developed in consultation
with the Task Force which is charged with coordinating among, and providing technical assistance to, regional, State,
and local entities regarding environmentally sound approaches to prevention and control of aquatic nuisance species.



Environment 


No comments were received on the environmental implications of this rule. The Coast Guard considered the environmental
impact of this final rule and concluded that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not necessary. An
Environmental Assessment and a Finding of No Significant Impact are available for inspection or copying where indicated
under 

ADDRESSES

. The exchange of ballast water in open ocean will benefit the Hudson River environment and the Great Lakes environment
by helping to prevent potential infestations of nonindigenous species through ballast water emptied into the Hudson
River north of the George Washington Bridge and transferred through the Hudson River and into the Great Lakes. Introduction
of nonindigenous nuisance species through the ballast water of vessels has caused millions of dollars of damage to
date in the Great Lakes area. 
Initial study has concluded that the amount of vessels' seawater-ballast to be discharged into the Hudson River will
constitute such a small volume that no change in the salinity or temperature levels will occur. Species contained
in water collected from the open ocean are unlikely to survive a fresh water environment. Any nuisance species contained
in the ballast water will not therefore, create a new infestation. 
While these regulations will help to prevent potential infestations of species introduced through the ballast water
of vessels, data from the Army Corps of Engineers shows that no vessel traveled north of the George Washington Bridge
in a light cargo load condition after operating beyond the EEZ. This indicates that these vessels carried no ballast
water. Therefore, it is anticipated that few vessels will actually be discharging water into the Hudson River. Therefore,
the Coast Guard has concluded that the regulations will have no negative impact on the environment.

Cable Compulsory License; Definition of Cable System 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Copyright Office, Library of Congress. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Amendment of cable license regulation.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Copyright Office is repealing the provision of its regulations regarding the eligibility of multipoint distribution
service and multichannel multipoint distribution service operators for compulsory licensing under section 111
of the Copyright Act, and is amending other regulatory provisions necessitated by the Satellite Home Viewer Act of
1994. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 18, 1994, the President signed into law the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994 (1994 Home Viewer Act). Public
Law 103-369, 108 Stat. 3477. The 1994 Home Viewer Act extends the Copyright Act's section 119 compulsory license
for satellite carriers another five years, until December 31, 1999, and amends the section 111 cable compulsory license
definitions of a ``cable system'' and the ``local service area of a primary transmitter.'' These legislative amendments
to the Copyright Act require certain changes in Subchapter A, Part 201 of the Copyright Office's regulations, 37 C.F.R.



Definition of a Cable System_Wireless Cable Systems 


The 1994 Home Viewer Act amends the definition of a ``cable system'' in the section 111 cable compulsory license to
include what are known as ``wireless'' cable systems. ``Wireless'' cable operators, which provide video retransmission
in the Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) and the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS), are
eligible for section 111 compulsory licensing for the broadcast signals that they retransmit to their subscribers.

By clarifying the section 111(f) definition of a ``cable system'' to include ``wireless'' cable operators, the 1994
Home Viewer Act expressly overruled a prior decision of the Copyright Office that ``wireless'' cable operators did
not come within the section 111(f) definition. On January 29, 1992, the Office concluded its inquiry into the definition
of a ``cable system'' in Docket No. 86-7B and issued a regulation denying both ``wireless'' cable operators
and satellite carriers eligibility for the cable compulsory license. 57 FR 3284 (1992). This regulation added a new
subsection (k) to section 201.17 of the Office's rules, the pertinent part of which provided: 


Satellite Carriers and MMDS Not Eligible 


Satellite carriers, satellite resale carriers, multipoint distribution services, and multichannel multipoint
distribution services are not eligible for the cable compulsory license based upon an interpretation of the whole
of section 111 of title 17 of the United States Code. 
Subsequent to the issuance of this regulation, the Copyright Office delayed its effective date until January 1, 1995.
58 FR 40363 (July 28, 1993). 
In light of the 1994 Home Viewer Act change to the ``cable system'' definition, the Office is amending  201.17(k)
to conform to the law and will treat ``wireless'' cable operators as being eligible for the cable compulsory license
since January 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act and section 111. Satellite carriers, however, continue
to remain ineligible for the section 111 license and the regulation is revised to notify satellite carriers when they
may request a refund of royalties submitted to the Copyright Office under section 111. 


Local Service Area of a Primary Transmitter 


The other change to the cable compulsory license made by the 1994 Home Viewer Act is the broadening of the section 111(f)
definition of the ``local service area of a primary transmitter.'' The definition is used to determine when a broadcast
station is local or distant to a cable operator, which in turn determines whether the operator must pay a royalty fee
for that station. Effective July 1, 1994, the local service area of a broadcast station for copyright purposes also
includes the area in which the station is entitled to insist upon carriage of its signal by a cable system (i.e. its must-carry
zone), in accordance with the rules of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on September 18, 1993, and
any subsequent modification of those rules. 


Satellite Carriers 


Section 201.11(a) and (b) are amended to reflect passage of the 1994 Home Viewer Act, including the royalty rate and
the definitional changes to section 119 of the Copyright Act.

Mandatory Patent Licenses Under Section 308 of the Clean Air Act 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On occasion, a party attempting to comply with a standard of the Clean Air Act [CAA] may be unable to meet the standard
without resort to a patented technology. CAA section 308 provides a mechanism by which such a non-complying party
may obtain a patent license where it has been unsuccessful in its attempts to obtain a license on its own. Under CAA section
308, the United States may require the owner of the patented technology to grant the non-complying party a patent license
in exchange for a reasonable royalty if the patented technology is necessary to meet the requirements in certain sections
of the CAA. 



The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) imposes certain limits on the ability of the United States to force
patent owners to grant licenses under their patents. Section 104(b) of the North American Free Trade Implementation
Act requires EPA to issue a regulation conforming CAA section 308 with the mandatory patent licensing restrictions
found in NAFTA article 1709(10). 

EPA is issuing this rule to ensure that EPA's implementation of CAA section 308 conforms with the requirements of NAFTA
article 1709(10). The rule establishes the policies and procedures EPA will follow prior to applying to the Attorney
General for a mandatory license under a patent covering a technology necessary to enable compliance with the new stationary
sources standards, hazardous air pollutants standards, or motor vehicle emission standards of the CAA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Authority 


This rule is promulgated under the authority of CAA section 308, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7608, and the North American
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Public Law No. 103-182, section 104, 107 Stat. 2057, 2064 (1993).



II. Background 


Section 308 of the Clean Air Act provides for mandatory licensing of patented technologies needed to meet certain
CAA requirements. Under section 308, the United States can require the owner of a patented technology that is necessary
to enable another party's compliance with certain limitations of the Clean Air Act to permit the other party to practice
the patented technology in exchange for a reasonable royalty set by a Federal court. In order to compel the licensing
of a patent under section 308, the EPA Administrator must ask the Attorney General to certify to a Federal district
court that the following conditions are satisfied: 
(a) The patent must be necessary for compliance with the standards of the CAA sections 111, 112 or 202; 
(b) The patent right must be actively in use or intended for public or commercial use and not otherwise reasonably available;

(c) No reasonable alternatives to licensing the patent can exist for meeting the specified CAA standards; and 
(d) Failure to license the patent may cause reduced competition or monopoly conditions in any area of trade. 
Upon certification of the above conditions to a Federal district court by the Attorney General, the court may then
order the patent holder to license the patent under terms and conditions determined by the court after a hearing. 

Chapter 17 of the NAFTA addresses intellectual property issues generally and article 1709 addresses patents specifically.
NAFTA article 1709 promotes the availability of patent protection for a broad range of inventions and also limits
the scope of permissible violations of patent rights. The latter function is performed by paragraph 10 of article
1709, which sets conditions for violating a patent holder's right to decide the conditions for practice of the holder's
patent. 

NAFTA Article 1709(10) sets specific conditions that must be met by the compulsory patent licensing statutes of any
member country. The conditions are as follows: 
(a) Authorization of each compulsory license of a patent must be considered on the individual merits;

<DOCNO> FR941230-0-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941230-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) Any proposed compulsory licensee already must have made efforts to obtain authorization from the patent holder;


(c) The scope and duration of an authorized compulsory patent license must be limited; 

(d) An authorized compulsory patent license must be non-exclusive; 

(e) An authorized compulsory patent license must be non-assignable; 

(f) An authorized compulsory patent license must be predominantly for supply of the domestic market; 

(g) The authorization of the compulsory patent license must be terminable when the circumstances that led to the authorization
cease to exist; 

(h) Patent holders must be paid adequate compensation; 

(i) Authorization decisions must be subject to judicial or other independent review; 

(j) Compensation rates must be subject to judicial or other independent review; 

(k) When an authorized compulsory use is necessary to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative
process to be anti-competitive, a member country is allowed greater latitude in applying conditions (a)-(j), including
noncompliance with conditions (b) and (f); and 

(l) Authorization of the use of a patent in order to permit exploitation of another patent shall not be granted except
as a remedy for an adjudicated violation of laws directed against anti-competitive practices. 

No direct conflict exists between NAFTA article 1709(10) and CAA section 308. However, section 308 does not address
a number of the NAFTA conditions. The following rule establishes the policies and procedures that EPA will follow
before applying to the Attorney General, pursuant to CAA section 308, for a mandatory license under a patent covering
a technology necessary to enable compliance with CAA sections 111, 112 or 202. The procedures in the rule ensure that
EPA's implementation of CAA section 308 will conform to article 1709(10) of the NAFTA. 

Section 95.1 of the rule sets forth definitions of a number of terms used in the rule. Section 95.2 identifies who is
entitled to petition the EPA for a mandatory patent license under section 308 and the required contents of such petitions.
Section 95.3 identifies findings that EPA will have to make prior to making application to the Attorney General for
a mandatory patent license under CAA section 308. These findings reflect the requirements of CAA section 308 and NAFTA
Article 1709(10). Section 95.4 of the rule sets forth certain limitations that will be included in all mandatory patent
licenses for which EPA makes application to the Attorney General under CAA section 308. These limitations are in accord
with the requirements of CAA section 308 and NAFTA article 1709(10). 

EPA published this rule in a notice of proposed rulemaking published on August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44390). EPA received
three comments in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. Each of the three comments expressed the concern
that the proposed rule might be used to require mandatory licensing of patented products or processes that are only
marginally related to reducing air pollution. Each comment suggested that the language of the proposed rule should
be amended to state that mandatory patent licenses under CAA section 308 may be required only for patents relating
to air pollution control. 

This rule is not intended to limit the technologies for which mandatory patent licenses may be sought under CAA section
308 more than is already provided in CAA section 308. That is, the technology must be necessary to enable compliance
with CAA section 111 (new stationary sources standards), section 112 (hazardous air pollutants), or section 202
(motor vehicle emission standards). However, EPA notes that under the rule, the EPA Administrator may apply to the
Attorney General for a mandatory patent license pursuant to CAA section 308 only after expressly finding that the
patented technology is not otherwise reasonably available, and that there are no other reasonable alternatives
for accomplishing compliance with CAA section 111, 112 or 202. These requirements help ensure that a mandatory patent
license will not be ordered pursuant to this rule where the patent is only marginally related to meeting the standards
of the CAA.

III. Procedural Requirements 


A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the requirements
of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken
or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan
programs, or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out
of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. 

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' because
none of the listed criteria apply to this action. Consequently, this action was not submitted to OMB for review under
Executive Order 12866. 



B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-354, which requires preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule codifies
the existing procedures for application of CAA section 308 and imposes no new impacts on large or small entities. Therefore,
no regulatory flexibility analyses has been prepared. 



D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

 An Information Collection document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1714.01), and a copy may be obtained from Sandy
Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA Mail Code 2136, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202)
260-2740. 

The public reporting burden for this collection of information would be a one-time burden for each petitioner. The
burden was estimated on the basis of the number of hours needed to complete a single petition, along with the associated
cost. 

Completing a petition was estimated to require 21 hours at a cost of $1482. This includes time for reviewing instructions,
gathering materials supporting the patent license, identifying other interested parties, and composition of a
statement of facts upon which the petition is based. EPA received no comments regarding this information collection
requirement. ICR No. 1714.01 was approved by OMB, Control Number 2060-0307, on October 3, 1994. Unless renewed,
ICR No. 1714.01 will expire on October 31, 1997.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY</USDEPT>








Suspension of Community Eligibility 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule identifies communities, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), that are suspended on the effective dates listed within this rule because of noncompliance
with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective
suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn by publication in the 

Federal Register

.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., unless
an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations,
44 CFR part 59 et seq. Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of
that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt
and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is
published but prior to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their
eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in
the 

Federal Register

. 


In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas in these communities
by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth
column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction
or acquisition of buildings in the identified special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP
and identified for more than a year, on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's initial flood insurance map of the
community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a),
as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities
listed on the date shown in the last column. 
The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified. 
Each community receives a 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that
the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective
suspension date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.



National Environmental Policy Act


This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Deputy Associate Director has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage
unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed no longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the communities unless they take remedial action. 


Regulatory Classification


This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under 
the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR
51735. 


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism


This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, October
26, 1987, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 252. 


Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform


This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, October 25, 1991, 56 FR 55195,

Random Drug Testing; Reduction of 1995 Minimum Testing Rate and Post-Accident Toxicological Testing; Testing Kit
Replacement 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notices.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Railroad Administrator (Administrator) has determined that the minimum annual random drug testing
rate for the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 will be 25 percent of covered railroad employees. This
is a reduction from 50 percent to 25 percent and is based on data from 1992 and 1993 railroad annual reports which shows
that good cause exists to decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees
beginning January 1, 1995. 



This notice also provides interim procedures to be followed until FRA amends Appendix C to part 219 to modify its post-accident
testing procedures, toxicology kits, instructions, and forms to accommodate mandatory urine split sample testing
and optional breath alcohol testing. FRA intends to amend Appendix C and have new post-accident testing kits available
by February 28, 1995.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 

Administrator's Determination of 1995 Random Drug Testing Rate



On December 2, 1994, FRA, together with the Office of the Secretary, the Federal Aviation Administration, the United
States Coast Guard, the Research and Special Programs Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, and
the Federal Transit Administration, published a final rule authorizing each operating administration to lower
its minimum random drug testing rate to 25 percent if its industry-wide random positive rate is less than 1.0 percent
for two calendar years while testing at 50 percent (59 FR 62218). The operating administration would return the rate
to 50 percent if the random positive rate for its industry is 1.0 percent or higher in any subsequent calendar year.
The industry-wide random positive rate for each transportation industry would be calculated from data submitted
to each operating administration and announced yearly by each administration's respective Administrator.

<TEXT>
 

Unlike some of the other operating administrations, FRA already has several years of industry drug testing data compiled
from railroad annual reports previously filed under  217.13(d). (On December 23, 1993, FRA repealed this section
of its annual reporting requirements and replaced it with a Management Information System to collect drug misuse
program data (58 FR 68233). These reports indicate that the rail positive rate has been below 1.0 percent for the previous
two consecutive calendar years. In 1992, the rail industry positive rate, while testing at 50 percent, was .79 percent;
in 1993 it was .72 percent.

Therefore, based on this data, FRA reduces the minimum annual random drug testing rate from 50 percent to 25 percent
effective January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995. FRA will announce the 1996 minimum annual random drug testing
rate in a future Federal Register notice.



Replacement of Post-Accident Testing Kits



On February 15, 1994, FRA published a final rule amending its regulations on alcohol and drug misuse (49 CFR 219) in
response to the testing requirements mandated by the Omnibus Transportation Testing Act of 1991. Prompted by recent
low positive rates, FRA also raised the amount of railroad property damage required for major train accidents and
for impact accidents, by redefining  219.201(a)(1)(iii) (major train accidents) to require testing for accidents
that cause $1,000,000 or more in damage, and redefining  219.201(a)(2)(ii) (impact accidents) to require
testing for non-injury accidents that cause $150,000 or more in damage. Together, these changes should result in
about 30 percent fewer post-accident tests being conducted. Additionally, FRA excluded from post-accident testing
accidents that otherwise qualify but are clearly attributable to vandalism.

To accommodate these changes, FRA announced that it will be amending Appendix C to part 219 to modify its post-accident
testing procedures, toxicology kits, instructions, and forms to accommodate mandatory urine split sample testing
and optional breath alcohol testing. FRA also will change its post-accident custody and control forms, instructions,
and testing kits. Since FRA already splits post-accident blood samples into two sealed 10 milliliter tubes, the only
addition for split sample testing will be inclusion of a second urine specimen bottle in the kit. FRA will also revise
Forms F6180.73 and F6180.74 to allow for railroad reporting of evidential breath test results by adding a check off
box for the railroad representative to indicate whether one or more employees have been breath tested.

Unfortunately, FRA will be unable to provide enough post-accident kits and forms to supply the entire industry before
the January 1, 1995, effective date for alcohol testing. Therefore, for now, railroads should continue to follow
the Post-Accident Testing Sample Collection Procedures listed in the current Appendix C to Part 219. To allow for
a smooth transition, FRA will not implement post-accident split sample urine testing until new kits and forms become
available. When this occurs, FRA will publish a notice and a revised Appendix C to Part 219 containing split sample
urine procedures. The anticipated target date is February 28, 1995. FRA will publish additional notices if further
implementation delays become necessary.

The revised post-accident testing criteria will still take effect as scheduled on January 1, 1995, however. As an
interim measure, until new kits and forms are available, when testing is required under one of the redefined categories
(i.e., ``major train accident,'' or ``impact accident''), railroad representatives should line through the existing
monetary thresholds printed on the current form FRA F6180.73 and write in ``$1,000,000 or more'' (``major train accident'')
or ``$150,000 or more'' (``impact accident''), whichever is applicable. (The criteria for fatal train incidents
and passenger train accidents listed on form F6180.73 remain the same.)

If a railroad conducts breath alcohol tests, the railroad representative may either attach a copy of the standard
DOT (49 CFR Part 40) breath alcohol testing form (the railroad will have to make an additional copy for FRA purposes,
since the Part 40 form allows only for breath alcohol technician, employee, and employer copies) to the FRA forms to
be shipped with the toxicology kit, or send a copy of each Part 40 form directly to FRA within 10 days of the tests. The
revised Appendix C will also contain these instructions.

As stated above, FRA intends to have new kits and forms 
available by February 28, 1995. In anticipation, FRA will 
provide replacement kits on a one-for-one basis at no charge. In 
order to accomplish an orderly kit changeover, railroads are 
asked to provide FRA with information as to the number of kits to 
be replaced, the mailing address where the new kits are to be 
sent, and the name and telephone number of a responsible officer at each location, no later than January 10, 1995. This
will ensure kits are distributed to the locations most advantageous to railroads. In compiling this list, railroads
should consider the composition of the new replacement kits. Each replacement kit will contain only three individual
specimen boxes instead of the current five. (FRA's existing list is obsolete due to operational changes and consolidations
that have occurred since the last kit replacement in 1990).

Railroads should send the required information in writing to Mr. Lamar Allen, FRA Alcohol and Drug Program Manager,
400 7th Street S.W., Room 8314, Washington, D.C. 20590 (202) 366-0127. In order to facilitate kit replacement,
FRA would appreciate if railroads could provide the listing on a diskette in WordPerfect as well.

Regulations Governing Fees for Services Performed in Connection With Licensing and Related Services_1995 Update




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission adopts its 1995 User Fee Update and revises its fee schedule at this time to recover the cost associated
with the January 1995 Government salary increases. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Since 1985, the Commission has issued an annual decision that updates its user fee schedule as required by the regulations
in 49 CFR 1002.3. In previous fee update decisions, which generally were effective in October, the Commission's fees
were revised based on the cost study formula set forth at 49 CFR 1002.3(d). Also, in certain years, selected fees were
modified to reflect new cost study data or changes in Commission fee policy. 



In Regulations Governing Fees For Services_1994 Update, 10 I.C.C.2d 194 (1994), the Commission changed the regulations
in 49 CFR 1002.3(a) to provide that the entire fee schedule, or selected fees, could be modified more than once a year,
if necessary. Because Commission employees will receive a salary increase of 3.22% in January 1995, we are updating
our user fees, effective February 1, 1995, to recover our increased personnel cost. All fees will be updated based
on our cost formula contained in 49 CFR 1002.3(d). 

The fee increases involved here result only from the mechanical application of the update formula in 49 CFR 1002.3(d),
which was adopted through notice and comment procedures in Regulations Governing Fees for Services_1987 Update,
4 I.C.C.2d 137 (1987). Therefore, we believe that good cause exists for finding that notice and comment is unnecessary
for this proceeding. See Regulations Governing Fees For Services_1990 Update, 7 I.C.C.2d 3 (1990), Regulations
Governing Fees For Services_1991 Update, 8 I.C.C.2d 13 (1991), and Regulations Governing Fees For Services_1993
Update, 9 I.C.C.2d 855 (1993). 

We conclude that these fee changes, which are being adopted here, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, because the Commission's regulations provide for waiver of filing fees for those entities
which can make the required showing of financial hardship. 
Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision. To obtain a copy of the full decision, write, call,
or pick up in person from Dynamic Concepts, Inc., Room 2229, Interstate Commerce Commission Building, 1201 Constitution

Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico; 1995 Red Snapper Specifications 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the framework procedure for adjusting management measures of the Fishery Management Plan for
the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), NMFS issues this final rule to reduce the daily bag limit for red
snapper from seven to five fish, increase the minimum allowable size of red snapper from 14 inches (35.6 cm) to 15 inches
(38.1 cm) for persons subject to the bag limit, and delay the opening of the commercial fishery for red snapper until
February 24, 1995. The intended effects of this rule are to maintain the annual total allowable catch (TAC) specifications
for red snapper, to prevent overfishing of red snapper, and to ensure that the commercial red snapper fishery is open
when demand for fresh fish is at its highest. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The reef fish fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery
Management Council (Council) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 641. 


The FMP provides for the Council's annual review and proposed adjustment of certain specifications for the red snapper
fishery, such as TAC, bag limits, and other management measures. This final rule will implement those specifications
for 1995 that were approved by NMFS. The background and rationale for the measures in this final rule were contained
in the proposed rule (59 FR 60124, November 22, 1994) and are not repeated here.

A minority report was submitted by five Council members in opposition to the bag limit reduction in the regulatory
amendment. Their comments also were referenced in a subsequent Council letter that requested a seven-fish bag limit
in lieu of the more conservative bag limits proposed in the regulatory amendment (i.e., they requested that the portions
of the recommended regulatory amendment that pertained to bag limit reductions be rescinded). This letter was objected
to by two separate minority reports, signed by one and five Council members, respectively. 
In addition, comments were received from 31 entities, including three from charter vessel and headboat associations,
one from a commercial seafood association, one from a local government agency, and 26 from other members of the public.
Specific responses follow each comment. 


Bag Limit Reduction 




Comment:

 The minority report opposing the regulatory amendment claimed that several Council members initially misunderstood
the motion they voted for (including a five-fish red snapper bag limit) and thought instead they were voting for a six-fish
bag limit. The minority report also claims that a motion to reconsider the vote approved by a majority of the Council
failed because some Council members thought they were voting again on the proposal (instead of a motion to reconsider).
Additionally, they stated the approved regulatory amendment provisions were voted on with inadequate discussion.



Response:

 All motions at the Council meeting were adequately displayed on a screen for review and consideration prior to voting.
The record shows that the vote for the more conservative bag limits was preceded by a vote to call the question. Passage
of that vote to call the question indicates the majority of the Council evidently felt that the discussion of several
alternatives was adequate. Failure of a subsequent motion to reconsider the bag limits also indicate the majority
of the Council was aware of its actions. Review of the administrative record indicates that the Council's vote was
procedurally correct. 


Comment:

 The Council's letter that recommended a seven-fish bag limit also requested rescission of the more conservative
bag limit proposal. Three of the public comments contested the decision by NMFS not to withdraw the proposed rule in
response to the Council's vote on November 16, 1994. 


Response:

 The framework procedure under the FMP sets out the process for annual management measure adjustments, under which
the Council's original recommendation had already been forwarded for publication. The Council was advised by NOAA
General Counsel at its November 1994 meeting that its new recommendation for the red snapper management regime in
1995 could be submitted as a comment on the proposed rule. NMFS fully considered the Council's recommendations before
taking final action on the rule. The Council's letter is responded to herein.

Comment: 

The minority report opposing the regulatory amendment stated that the Council's Stock Assessment Panel (SAP) and
Council staff repeatedly noted inaccuracies in the data sets, particularly the age-length keys. As a result, the
stock assessment has a high level of uncertainty that was not considered by the Council at its September 1994 meeting
in discussing the need for a 43-percent reduction from 1993 harvest levels. The minority report also noted that a Council
member described his own analysis of the available data that indicated a 15-inch (38.1 cm) size limit, combined with
a six- or seven-fish bag limit, would achieve a 43-percent reduction in recreational harvest. 

A letter from a charter vessel and headboat association claimed that the NMFS data are inaccurate and that the red snapper
resource is in much better condition than suggested by the analyses. 



Response: 

The NMFS stock assessment has undergone extensive peer review. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (Center)
and the Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) found that the assessment is based on the best available
scientific information. NMFS concludes that the issues raised in the minority report do not change the conclusions
reached by the assessment. However, NMFS agrees with the need to continually update the stock assessment data base
used in formulating management decisions. Appropriate updates to the data base will be made as warranted. 

NMFS is aware that the current virtual population analysis (VPA) utilizes catch by age, by assigning ages at length,
and is initiating research that will result in improved age information for the VPA. In the interim, the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires use of the best available scientific information, which
is the NMFS assessment. 

The alternative analysis by a Council member was not accepted at the meeting as being based on the best available scientific
information. NMFS concludes that the referenced alternative analysis did not account for changes in mean weight,
increases in the number of participants in the fishery, or non-compliance with the regulations. 



Comment: 

The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment also noted that preliminary harvest estimates for
1994 were discussed by the Council as an indication that recreational harvest rates are increasing. However, these
estimates were based on only 6 months of data and probably are not indicative of the whole year. There have been increases
in numbers and size of red snapper landings for 4 years, which show that the resource is not stressed. 



Response: 

The increases in the number and size of red snapper are expected and indicate that the resource is recovering, but the
stock assessment shows that the stock remains overfished. The stock assessment also shows that unless the recreational
harvest is constrained to its allocation, the prescribed recovery schedule will not be achieved. The status of the
overfished resource will continue to be updated as more complete harvest data become available. 



Comment: 

The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment claimed that new information indicates that red snapper
may live longer than originally assumed, possibly as long as 55 years. This information indicates the generation
time and recovery period could be extended, allowing a less restrictive allowable catch level. Moreover, drastic
changes in the red snapper measures are inappropriate, given the current recovery schedule. 



Response: 

NMFS assessment scientists have recently evaluated the effect of changes in generation time on red snapper recovery
periods. This evaluation was based on newly acquired information and was presented to the Council and its Reef Fish
Management Committee during their November 1994 meetings. In response, the Council requested that the SAP and SSC
review these analyses. These efforts are designed to enable the Council to make objective, risk-adverse decisions.
In the interim, however, red snapper management decisions must be accomplished using the best available scientific
information.

Comment: 

The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment claimed that the recreational harvests calculated
for 1993 are inflated. Specifically, the Texas charter vessel estimate appears to be excessive, compared to that
of prior years. This estimate was based on only five interviews and has a very large standard error associated with
it. Consequently, 1993 harvest estimates may have been overestimated and should be reduced to provide a higher allowable
catch level.



Response: 

Although it can be argued that the Texas charter vessel information has a fairly low level of precision, the existing
data still represent the best scientific information available to the Council and NMFS in making management decisions.
Moreover, sufficient justification does not exist for the compensatory reduction in Texas landings requested by
the commenter. 



Comment: 

The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment referenced estimates of red snapper year-class strength
that indicate that the 1990 year-class was weaker than the 1989 year-class. However, the estimates of numbers of red
snapper alive by age, in June of each year, show a greater number of age-0 red snapper alive in 1989 than in 1990. This
casts doubt on the reliability of the year-class strength estimates and, in turn, on the spawning potential ration
(SPR) estimates that are derived using the year-class strength estimates. 



Response: 

NMFS believes that a very poor relationship exists between age-0 abundance and documented catches of older fish in
the red snapper catch. Actual catch records for recent fishing years indicate that the 1990 year-class was weaker
than the 1989 year-class. The discrepancy alleged by the commenter is a result of the VPA calculation, not an inaccuracy
of the year-class data base. For these reasons, NMFS disagrees with the comment. 



Comment: 

The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment also indicated that the Council was presented with
the results of a recent scientific study that suggests a lower recreational release mortality. However, the population
projection model could not be modified to use: (1) Release mortality other than the 33-percent level assumed in the
assessment, and (2) zero or differential release mortalities for recreational and commercial fishing. Use of these
modifications may have produced results indicating that less restrictive measures were needed. For example, several
Council members believe that a release mortality of 5 to 10 percent is appropriate. Assuming the lower release mortality,
the reduced bag limits would result in an unnecessarily high reduction of harvest by approximately 52 percent from
1993 harvest levels. As a result, the five-fish bag limit is too restrictive. 

The Council minority report also claimed that since the recreational allocation refers only to red snapper caught
and retained, incorporating release mortality into the analysis in effect double counts the impact of release mortality.
An analysis of zero release mortality therefore should be used. 



Response: 

The NMFS stock assessment reviewed a number of studies of red snapper and other reef fish that estimate release mortality
between zero and 67 percent. However, the studies indicating a red snapper release mortality less than 33 percent
have not been extensively peer-reviewed or accepted by NMFS. As a result, the assessment assumed 33-percent release
mortality. This assumption was extensively peer-reviewed and remains the best available scientific information.


Since the assessment was completed, new recreational fishing mortality estimates will be reviewed by NMFS, SAP,
and SSC to determine if a change to the release mortality is warranted. However, depending on its magnitude, such a
change would not allow necessarily an increase in the recreational bag limit for red snapper in future years. 

The Center stated that its staff does not agree that the assessment double counts the impact of release mortality.
Elimination of release mortality from the assessment would allow this source of fishing mortality to be unaccounted
for in determining the status of the resource. Moreover, elimination of the release mortality is contrary to the best
available scientific information and should not be used in the VPA. NMFS therefore disagrees with this comment. 



Comment: 

The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment noted that a state agency study disputed the fecundity
data in the red snapper stock assessment. The minority report stated that the state agency is in the process of reevaluating
these data. 



Response: 

NMFS concludes that the points raised do not change the results of the stock assessment. Once the referenced state
study is complete, the results will be considered for inclusion into the data base. In the interim, the fecundity data
in the stock assessment must be relied upon as the best available scientific information.

Comment:

 The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment noted that: (1) No data were presented on the impact
of prohibiting the operators and crews on vessels operating as charter vessels or headboats from retaining red snapper,
and (2) the effect of this measure is unknown. 




Response:

 NMFS agrees with this comment. Review of the administrative record indicated inadequate justification or rationale
for the measure, and insufficient analysis supporting its implementation. The measure was disapproved for this
and other reasons stated in this rule. 




Comment:

 The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment claimed that the Council had no real data available
on the economic impacts of the bag limit reductions on the recreational fishing industry. Similar statements also
were included in many public comments. The minority report noted that the Council's Socioeconomic Panel (SEP) Report
included only a brief reference that the for-hire sector may be adversely affected by any bag limit reduction. 




Response:

 The Council had all available information on the socioeconomic impacts of the proposal before its vote. That information
included extensive public testimony and recommendations from industry representatives on the Reef Fish Advisory
Panel, as well as the report from the SEP Panel. The regulatory amendment provided additional socioeconomic analyses
that were fully considered before NMFS reached its decision. 




Comment:

 One public comment stated, as previously indicated in testimony to the Council, the proposed bag and size limit changes
are being made without consideration of social and economic factors. The comment cited 50 CFR 602.12 and suggested
that: (1) The stock assessment and fishery evaluation (SAFE Report) contained inadequate economic information,
and (2) economic and social studies are lacking and need to be considered before the management changes could be justified.





Response:

 NMFS fully considered all available scientific information and public comments before acting on the proposed rule.
This included testimony to the Council by the commenter and other fishery participants at its September and November
1994 meetings. NMFS agrees with the comment, however, on the need for additional economic and social studies such
that the results can be fully considered by the Council and NMFS before making additional management decisions. In
the interim, however, action for the 1995 season must be based on the best available scientific information including
the social and economic data currently accepted by NMFS and included in the SAFE Report. 




Comment:

 The Council's letter that requested a seven-fish bag limit referenced public testimony that a lower bag limit for
red snapper would increase pressure on various alternative species. Conversely, status quo (a seven-fish bag limit)
would eliminate any impacts from this shift.

Response:

 NMFS does not dispute the possibility of switching fishing effort to other species as a result of this rule. In fact,
this should help mitigate adverse economic impacts expected by the more conservative red snapper bag limits. NMFS
agrees that the shift in effort could increase harvest of Spanish mackerel and the other reef fish species listed in
the letter. However, increased effort on those species is less risky than allowing continued overfishing of red snapper,
which are more severely overfished. NMFS will continue to monitor harvest of these species under the existing data
collection program and will recommend action as appropriate in cooperation with the Regional Fishery Management
Councils. 





Comment:

 The Council's letter that requested a seven-fish bag limit noted that charter vessel operators testified to the Council
that it was incorrect to assume constant demand for charter trips if the bag limit was reduced. 





Response:

 NMFS acknowledges the possibility that demand for charter trips may decrease, depending on customer reaction to
the more conservative bag limit. This was strongly indicated by public comments on the proposed rule, as well as the
comment in the minority report. 
Comments from the Center, however, indicated substantive concerns over a significant overrun if demand stays constant.
Accordingly, NMFS has requested the Council to continue to monitor recreational harvest of red snapper closely throughout
the 1995 fishing year and to consider further restrictions if necessary. 





Comment:

 Thirty public comments predicted severe economic impacts following implementation of the more conservative limits.
Twenty-one objected to the five-fish bag limit, not the size limit increase. 





Response:

 NMFS disagrees with these comments. The approved red snapper catch restrictions are being implemented to reduce
excessive recreational harvest and thus prevent overfishing of red snapper in 1995. Any adverse economic impacts
that may result upon implementation of the final rule depend on the ability of fishermen to switch to alternative species.
Negative impacts are expected to be less severe than those that would result from continued overfishing of red snapper.






Comment:

 Two minority reports were submitted opposing the Council's vote for a seven-fish bag limit and rescission of the regulatory
amendment. The first report, signed by one Council member, noted that: The seven-fish bag limit would jeopardize
the stock, thereby violating national standard 1; analysis of the seven-fish bag limit was absent, thereby violating
national standard 2; two charter vessel operators supported a five-fish bag limit in their testimony to the Council;
no public testimony to the Council suggested that implementation of only a size limit increase (as proposed in the
Council's letter of November 23, 1994) would reduce the number of trips or level of fishing effort; and maintaining
a 7-fish bag limit and increasing the size limit to 15 inches (38.1 cm) would cause a greater overrun than projected
by the Center for a more conservative bag limit. 
The second minority report in opposition to the Council's vote for a seven-fish bag limit referred to NMFS stock assessment
information and public testimony, which indicates that more conservative catch limitations are needed than would
be provided under a seven-fish bag limit. 





Response:

 NMFS agrees with these comments. Maintaining the 7-fish bag limit would not constrain the recreational fishery to
its allocation or prevent overfishing. More conservative limits are needed to reduce fishing mortality at the start
of the 1995 fishing year. 




Size Limit 







Comment:

 The Council and 10 of the public comments support the proposed increase in the size limit for recreational catches
of red snapper as a substitute for reduced bag limits. The Council's letter requesting the seven-fish bag limit also
stated that the increased recreational size limit for red snapper in 1995 would result in reduced availability of
legal-sized red snapper to the recreational sector, compared to commercial harvesters under the 14-inch size (35.6
cm) limit during that time.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941230-0-00086 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941230-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Council suggested that, assuming a 0-percent release mortality, the size limit increase would reduce the numbers
of red snapper by 48 percent from 1993 harvest levels. They state that this would offset any increase in mean weight
of each fish due to the larger size limit. The Council's letter also noted that charter vessel and headboat operators
have stated that the five-fish bag limit will reduce demand for fishing trips, thereby offsetting an increase in harvest.


In addition, one of the signers of the second minority report opposing the seven-fish bag limit suggested a 13-inch
(13.0 cm) minimum size limit to reduce the release mortality of undersized fish and the average weight of each fish.




Response: 

NMFS does not agree that simply changing the size limit would produce the necessary reduction in recreational harvest.
The Council's statistician advised at the meeting that a seven-fish bag limit and 15-inch (38.1 cm) size limit would
result in a harvest higher than the allocation, even under the most liberal conditions of zero release mortality and
full compliance. The best available scientific information does not support the Council's position. 



Comment: 

The minority report opposing the regulatory amendment referenced a comment by a member of the Council's SAP that size
limits were more effective than bag limits in supporting the recovery program. Furthermore, the report noted that
public testimony to the Council indicated that size limit changes were more acceptable to the industry than reductions
in bag limits. 



Response: 

The best available scientific information, as referenced on page 7 of the stock assessment, indicates that size limits
alone are relatively ineffective in increasing yield per recruit or SPR. At this stage in the recovery of the overfished
red snapper resource, a combination of more conservative size and bag limits is appropriate to reduce recreational
harvest. For these reasons, NMFS disagrees with the comment and supports the more conservative size and bag limits.




Comment: 

Three public comments opposed the proposed increase in the size limit as unnecessary, since the existing catch restrictions
would continue to improve the red snapper resource. 



Response: 

Despite improvements in the status of the resource, red snapper still are overfished. Status quo, as suggested by
the commenter, would allow continued overfishing of red snapper at a size that would jeopardize the rebuilding schedule.
This, in turn, would adversely impact the biological integrity of the resource. 



Comment: 

A letter from a charter vessel and headboat association suggested that an 8-million-pound (m lb) (3.63 m kg) total
allowable catch (TAC) be implemented with a seven-fish recreational bag limit and 15-inch (38.1 cm) size limit. If
continuation of the 6.0-m lb (2.72 m kg) TAC is necessary, the association suggested approval of the 15-inch (38.1
cm) size limit, a seven-fish bag limit for party boats and charter vessels (zero bag limit for operators and crews),
and a five-fish bag limit for other recreational fishermen. 

The second minority report objecting to the Council's vote for a seven-fish bag limit contended that, due to the uncertainty
in the analyses, the TAC could be raised to as high as 8.0 m lb (3.63 m kg) with a 13-inch (33.0 cm) size limit. 



Response: 

The framework procedure indicates that TAC may not exceed allowable biological catch (ABC). Based on data in the assessment
and the FMP's rebuilding schedule, the SAP set the upper range of the ABC range at 6.0 m lb (2.72 m kg). The Council's SEP
recommended that the 6.0-m lb (2.72 m kg) upper limit be established as the ABC. Based on the SAP and SEP recommendations,
the Council proposed a continuation of the 6.0-m lb (2.72 m kg) TAC at the upper end of the ABC range. The 6.0-m lb (2.72
m kg) TAC approved for 1995 is consistent with the rebuilding program for red snapper, and within the constraints of
the framework procedure. 

The best available scientific information supports an increase in the minimum size limit to 15 inches (38.1 cm), not
a decrease to 13 inches (33.0 cm). Moreover, increasing the TAC to 8.0 m lb (3.63 m kg) would be in excess of the boundaries
of the ABC range. NMFS therefore disagrees with these comments. 



Headboat and Charter Vessel Operator and Crew Catch Prohibition 





Comment: 

The Council requested rescission of the zero bag limit it had proposed for charter vessel and headboat operators and
crew because of NMFS' evaluation that it would not result in any significant additional savings not already accounted
for by the other management proposals. 


 Twenty-one public comments opposed the zero bag limit, stating that it was unfair to charter vessel and headboat operators
and crew.

Response: 

NMFS disapproved the proposed red snapper bag limit of zero for operators and crews of vessels operating as a headboat
or charter vessel. Review of the administrative record indicated little justification or rationale for the measure
and insufficient analysis supporting its implementation. NMFS determined that the record does not provide specific
and sufficient information to support the conclusion that this measure is consistent with national standard 4 of
the Magnuson Act that requires management measures with allocation effects to be fair and equitable to all fishermen.
Moreover, a report by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center indicated that any conservation benefits from the zero
bag limit, in addition to those benefits provided by the approved measures, would be sufficiently small to be unmeasurable.
Should the Council consider proposing this measure again for subsequent fishing years, NMFS has recommended that
the Council evaluate the equity of allocation issues associated with the zero bag limit that were either not discussed
in or unresolved by the regulatory amendment. 



Additional Issues 





Comment: 

The minority report opposing the regulatory amendment noted that the Council was provided, at recent meetings, new
information indicating the possibility of a 50- to 60-percent reduction in shrimp trawl bycatch of juvenile red snapper.
However, the rebuilding schedule is based on a shrimp trawl bycatch reduction goal of 50 percent, and the benefits
of a 60-percent reduction were not analyzed. A letter from a charter vessel and headboat association indicated that
reduced shrimping effort already has decreased shrimp trawl bycatch of red snapper. 



Response: 

The red snapper stock assessment indicates that recovery of the overfished resource is dependent on reducing shrimp
trawl bycatch of juvenile red snapper by 50 percent. A prior amendment to the Magnuson Act prohibited mandatory reductions
of shrimp trawl bycatch before the year 1994. NMFS and the Council are working cooperatively with universities, states,
and the fishing industry to develop satisfactory methods of reducing the red snapper bycatch to this level, which
has not yet been achieved. 

The new data indicating the possibility of a 60 percent reduction are considered preliminary at this time. The Center
commented that currently no scientific evidence indicates that the estimates achieving a higher bycatch reduction
than 50 percent are the best available data. Once this new scientific information is accepted as the best available,
it will be considered in the management decision process. 



Comment: 

One public comment suggested that the current regulations should be enforced properly, instead of NMFS implementing
more restrictive catch limits. 


Response: 

NMFS agrees with the need for effective enforcement. However, NMFS disagrees with the suggestion of not implementing
more conservative red snapper limit. As discussed in this rule, such action is necessary to prevent overfishing of
red snapper. 



Comment: 

A public comment stated that the 1993 commercial season was closed once the quota for that year was met, then was reopened
for 2 additional weeks. 



Response: 

Review of the administrative record indicated that the commercial red snapper season was not reopened in 1993, as
indicated in this comment. 



Comment: 

The minority report objecting to continuing with the seven-fish bag limit stated that the FMP's provisions are inequitable
by requiring closure of the annual commercial fishery for the rest of the fishing year once the annual quota is projected
to be met, while allowing recreational fishermen to exceed their allocation. 



Response: 

The reef fish regulations require closure of the commercial sector for the remainder of the fishing season once the
quota is met. In contrast, recreational anglers are regulated year-round by reef fish bag limits designed to approximate
the overall recreational allocation based on harvest projections available at that time. Should either the commercial
or recreational sector exceed their respective annual allocation, the FMP provides for compensatory adjustments
in subsequent fishing years to comply with the rebuilding schedule. The FMP does not provide for an automatic closure
of the recreational fishery for the remainder of the fishing year, once the recreational allocation is harvested.
Such a change would have to be accomplished by an amendment to the FMP.

Delayed Reopening of the 1995 Commercial Season for Red Snapper 







Comment:

 One comment from a seafood association suggested an alternative season where half of the quota would be available
for harvest starting on January 1, and the remainder would be available on September 11 to the end of each year, starting
in 1995. 





Response: 

The suggestion of a split commercial season was previously considered and rejected by the Council, because of concerns
with quota monitoring and enforceability. Also, the bulk of the public testimony did not support the split season
measure without a relaxation of the commercial quota. NMFS supports the Council's decision for a February 24 starting
date. 




Changes From the Proposed Rule 





As discussed above, the zero bag limit for red snapper for charter vessel and headboat operators and crew has been removed
from  641.24(b)(1), making the five fish bag limit applicable. 




Classification 





This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 



NMFS determined that the proposed rule, if adopted, could have an effect exceeding 5 percent of gross for-hire commercial
revenues and an initial RFA was prepared. No comments were received on the initial RFA. NMFS prepared a final RFA that
addresses disapproval of the zero bag limit measure. The final determination of significance under the RFA was not
changed by the partial disapproval of the proposed rule. 



The intended effects of this final rule include constraining the recreational harvest of red snapper to its 1995 allocation
starting January 1 and ensuring that the commercial red snapper fishery is open when there is increased demand for
seafood. These intended effects will be seriously degraded if the effective date of this final rule is delayed beyond
the currently scheduled opening of the red snapper fishery on January 1, 1995. Accordingly, under the provisions
of section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds
for good cause that it is contrary to the public interest to delay for 30 days the effective date of this rule.

Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery; Emergency Rule To Provide for Interim ``A'' Limited Entry Permits 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Emergency interim rule; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NOAA issues this emergency interim rule to amend the implementing regulations for the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery
Management Plan (FMP) to relax the qualifying criteria for issuance of ``A'' limited entry fishing permits endorsed
with the size of larger replacement vessels. This action is necessary to rectify immediately what NOAA has determined
to be an inequity in the treatment, under the current regulations, of certain vessel owners with replacement vessels
more than 5 ft (1.52 m) longer than the qualifying vessel that was replaced. The intended effect of this rule is to provide
for participation in the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery by larger replacement vessels acquired prior to September
30, 1990 (and provided the vessel replaced was disposed of by that date), but whose owners were denied permits with
an endorsed size for the larger vessel. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 NOAA issues this emergency rule under the authority of section 305(c)(1) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and
Management Act. An emergency rule that changes a fishery management plan is treated as an amendment to such plan for
the period in which such regulation is in effect.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) prepared, and the Secretary of Commerce approved and implemented,
an amendment (Amendment 6) to the FMP, which established a limited entry program for the Pacific Coast groundfish
fishery off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California. Described simply, Amendment 6 and its implementing
regulations base initial issuance of limited entry permits upon: (1) Actual participation in the fishery during
the ``window period'' of July 11, 1984, to August 1, 1988, as evidenced by requisite landings of groundfish; or (2)
other evidence of an intent to participate in the fishery prior to August 1, 1988, followed by actual participation
in the fishery. Owners of vessels that made the requisite groundfish landings during the window period are eligible
to receive an ``A'' endorsement, which entitles the owner to fish with the same vessel, transfer the permit to another
vessel no larger than 5 ft (1.52 m) longer than the qualifying vessel, or sell the permit. ``A'' endorsed permits do
not expire, so long as the owner renews them annually; that is, there is no need to actually use the vessel in the fishery
to maintain eligibility for the program. 

Owners of vessels that did not make the requisite groundfish landings during the window period, but can show evidence
that they were preparing to enter the fishery, are eligible to receive a ``provisional A'' endorsement, which allows
them to participate in the fishery for up to a 3-year period. The ``provisional A'' category is intended to cover persons
who, prior to the close of the window period, began to construct a new vessel or convert an old vessel (or contracted
for such construction/conversion), but did not make the requisite landings of groundfish during the window period.
This category requires that the vessel actually participate in the groundfish fishery after its construction or
its conversion is complete. A ``provisional A'' endorsement requires that the owner land a minimum amount of groundfish
during each 365-day period commencing with the first landing of any species of fish subsequent to the vessel having
been constructed or converted. If the requisite 3 years of landings are completed, the owner is eligible to convert
a ``provisional A'' endorsement into an ``A'' endorsement. If the requisite 3 years of landings are not completed,
when scheduled, the ``provisional A'' endorsed permit expires. 

The FMP amendment that describes the limited entry program was adopted by the Council in September 1991, and submitted
to the Secretary for approval in 1992. A notice of availability and a proposed rule for Amendment 6 were published for
public comment in the 

Federal Register

 on June 10, 1992 (57 FR 24589), and July 22, 1992 (57 FR 32499) respectively. The Secretary approved Amendment 6 on September
4, 1992. Final regulations responding to public comment were published on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54001). 

During the development of Amendment 6, NOAA published two notices in the 

Federal Register

 informing the public of the Council's progress in developing the program so that fishing vessel owners could make
business decisions with some idea of what to expect the limited entry program would require, regarding requirements
to qualify for a limited entry permit. 

In a ``control date'' notice of August 4, 1988 
(53 FR 29337), the Council announced that only current owners of vessels used to catch fish in the fishery during the
period commencing on July 11, 1984, and ending on August 1, 1988, were likely to be eligible for initial permits under
the forthcoming Amendment 6. 

A subsequent notice published August 28, 1990 (55 FR 35163), set forth the Council's intent to impose a September 30,
1990, cutoff date for the completion of newly constructed or converted vessels, and that the Council would attempt
to limit fishing vessel harvesting capacity by endorsing limited entry permits with the ``length overall'' of the
qualifying vessel. This notice also announced that replacement vessels more than 5 ft (1.52 m) greater in overall
length than qualifying vessels that they replaced may be given a permit endorsed for the size of the smaller qualifying
vessel if replacement occurred after September 30, 1990, while replacement vessels in place prior to September 30,
1990, may be given a permit endorsed for the size of the larger replacement vessel. ``In place'' means that a new vessel
had been acquired and the old vessel had been disposed of.

In Amendment 6 and its implementing regulations, the eligibility requirements for a replacement vessel more than
5 ft (1.52 m) longer than the replaced vessel were significantly different from the requirements indicated in the
August 28, 1990, notice. Under the final regulations, a replacement vessel more than 5 ft (1.52 m) longer than the qualifying
vessel it replaces is eligible for a ``provisional A'' permit endorsed for the length of the longer vessel, but such
a ``provisional A'' permit can be converted to a permanent ``A'' endorsement only if the vessel made Pacific groundfish
landings in three successive 365-day periods after replacement.

Amendment 6 provides sufficient rationale as to why a new entrant_that is, a vessel under contract for construction
or conversion during the 1984 to 1988 window period_should have to meet a subsequent landing requirement to convert
a ``provisional A'' endorsement to an ``A'' endorsement. Absent this requirement, any fishing vessel under contract
for construction in any U.S. shipyard prior to August 1, 1988, would have been eligible for a limited entry permit,
regardless of the actual intent of the owners to participate in the Pacific groundfish fishery. The landings requirement
was thus a useful surrogate for confirming the owners' actual intent to operate in the fishery.

With respect to replacement vessels, however, the new landings requirement served to disqualify persons who were
clearly committed to the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery through their prior participation, but had the misfortune
of not knowing in advance that they would be subjected to a 3-year landing requirement for their new vessel.

It is reasonable to assume that some owners of qualifying vessels replaced those vessels prior to September 30, 1990,
with larger vessels based on the expectation that they would be issued a limited entry permit endorsed with the size
of the replacement vessel. A decision to grant these individuals an ``A'' permit endorsed with the size of the larger
replacement vessel is consistent with the objectives of the FMP to ``accommodate historical participation'' and
is consistent with the information on probable qualifying criteria available to the public prior to September 30,
1990. Therefore, NOAA has determined that those fishing vessel owners who replaced a qualifying vessel prior to September
30, 1990, with a larger vessel and who were denied ``A'' permits endorsed with the size of the larger replacement vessel
were treated unfairly and should be issued ``A'' permits endorsed with the size of the larger replacement vessel.

Some individuals denied limited entry permits for larger replacement vessels in place prior to September 30, 1990,
may have already purchased additional permits and combined them with a permit endorsed with the size of a smaller replaced
vessel in order to obtain a permit endorsed with the size of the larger replacement vessel or may have sold the permit
issued for the smaller vessel. NOAA intends to allow vessel owners in this circumstance to be granted a permit endorsed
for a length overall which, if combined with a permit endorsed for the length overall of the replaced vessel, would
result in a permit endorsed for the length overall of the replacement vessel. This will be determined based on the harvesting
capacity ratings listed in 50 CFR 663.33(g).

For the reasons described above, NOAA has determined it is necessary to provide immediately, by emergency regulation,
for the issuance of ``A'' permits to the owners of larger replacement vessels in place prior to September 30, 1990.
NOAA has determined that immediate issuance is necessary to provide the opportunity to those vessel owners to apply
for and receive ``A'' permits and participate in the Pacific groundfish fishery. Vessel owners in this circumstance
have demonstrated substantial participation in the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery in the past and their continued
participation is consistent with the FMP. In the absence of an emergency regulation, vessel owners would be prohibited
from using their larger replacement vessels in the groundfish fishery unless they purchase sufficient additional
permits.

Under this rule, owners who were denied ``A'' permits for larger replacement vessels, which were in place prior to
September 30, 1990, will have 45 days from the date this rule is published in the 

Federal Register

 to apply for a permit with an ``A'' endorsement. If qualified under the limited entry regulations, as amended by this
rule, applicants will be issued an ``A'' endorsement for the size of the larger replacement vessel. Applicants denied
an ``A'' permit under this rule may appeal to the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director), under  663.42
of the Pacific Coast groundfish regulations, except that the opportunity to have the appeal heard by the Council's
Permit Review Board under  663.42(e) will not be available, due to the short length of time this emergency rule
will be in effect.

In addition, any vessel owner wishing to submit a new application for an ``A'' permit under the provisions of this rule
must apply to the Fishery Permits Office of the Northwest Region (see 

ADDRESSES

).



Classification



NMFS has determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an emergency situation and is consistent with the Magnuson
Act and other applicable law.

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, also finds for good cause that the reasons justifying implementation
of this rule on an emergency basis also make it impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide prior notice
and opportunity for public comment under section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act. It is unnecessary to
delay for 30 days the effective date of these emergency regulations, under section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure
Act because this rule relieves a restriction.

This emergency rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

No environmental assessment was prepared under the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act because
this rule makes a minor change and is within the scope of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement prepared
for the limited entry plan (Amendment 6 to the FMP).

This emergency interim rule is in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This rule, by broadening eligibility
criteria for ``A'' permits, may slightly increase the information collection burden of the existing limited entry
permit program. The emergency rule does not alter the types of information required in a limited entry permit application,
as approved by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB Control Number 0648-0203.

``A'' permits for replacement vessels. 



(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the owner of a replacement vessel who meets the criteria of

will replace any permit previously issued for the size of the replaced vessel. 

(b) The ``A'' endorsement will be issued only for the gear(s) for which the replaced vessel would have qualified for
an ``A'' endorsement. 

(c) A request for the ``A'' permit authorized by this section must be submitted to FMD by February 13, 1995. The request
must include the name and official number of the replaced vessel and the replacement vessel, and the NMFS groundfish
limited entry application file number for either the replaced vessel or the replacement vessel. In the case of a vessel
that would qualify under this section, for which no application has been submitted previously, a new application
must be submitted. Application forms may be obtained from the FMD. 


(d) In the case of a vessel owner that qualifies for a new ``A'' permit under this section, who has already transferred
his or her smaller permit, or purchased additional permits to combine with the original permit, the FMD has authority
to grant a permit endorsed for a length overall which, if combined with a permit endorsed for the length overall of the
replaced vessel, would result in a permit endorsed for the length overall of the replacement vessel. This will be determined
based on the harvesting capacity ratings listed in  663.33(g). 


(e) The denial of an ``A'' permit under this section may be appealed to the Regional Director under  663.42, except
that  663.42(e) does not apply to decisions on permits under this section.

 under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (``Trust Indenture Act'').
 




















I. Background 



In 1987, Congress enacted Section 35A of the Exchange Act, which requires the Commission to certify to the Congress
that it will not adopt any rule requiring electronic filing by all registrants until mandatory electronic filings
from a significant test group of registrants have been received and reviewed by the Commission for a period of at least
six months.
 The Commission so certified in a letter to the House Committee on Government Operations dated December 27, 1988. Following
the conclusion of a successful voluntary pilot electronic filing program,
 in February 1993, the Commission adopted interim rules governing mandated electronic filing to begin implementation
of the operational EDGAR system
 Those rules consist of Regulation S-T, the regulatory cornerstone of the Commission's electronic filing framework,
and a number of related provisions in the Commission's rules, schedules and forms. 







On April 26, 1993, the date the interim rules became effective,
 the first of the participants in the Congressionally-mandated significant test group became subject to mandated
electronic filing. Additional participants were phased in until December 1993, when the significant test group,
consisting of approximately 3,500 filers, was complete.
 In keeping with the Commission's certification to Congress, no additional registrants were phased in to mandated
electronic filing after that point, although a number of registrants voluntarily became electronic filers since
the formation of the significant test group. Approximately 39,790 live filings and 23,335 test submissions were
received by EDGAR during the six-month significant test period (January 1 through June 30, 1994). As discussed below,
an evaluation of the significant test period was conducted in order to determine whether the staff should recommend
that the Commission make the interim rules final and applicable to all registrants, as planned, including those in
the significant test group, and proceed with the phase-in process.

II. Full Implementation of the EDGAR System 


While Congress required the Commission only to certify that filings from the significant test group would be received
and reviewed for a period of six months before mandating electronic filing for all registrants, a comprehensive study
of the significant test period results was undertaken by the Office of Information Technology (``OIT'') to form the
basis of a recommendation to the Commission as to whether implementation of EDGAR should proceed. In addition to the
information gathered internally, OIT sponsored a two-day EDGAR Filer Conference in April 1994 devoted in large part
to learning the public's views on the success of the EDGAR system and discussing its future. Comment on the system also
was solicited in the 

Federal Register.


 





OIT has coordinated the evaluation of data and public comments and prepared a report to the Commission that encompasses
a broad spectrum of issues.
 The system's integrity, reliability, responsiveness, stability, security, capacity and other criteria were evaluated.
The report indicates that each area of consideration satisfies or exceeds the requirements necessary to mandate
electronic filing by all domestic registrants and third party filers. The system, including EDGARLink, the filer
assistance software, is accessible to a broad base of filers at reasonable cost and can be enhanced to meet future needs
of filers and users of the information as they arise. Electronic filings made by the significant test group have provided
a suitable alternative to paper filings both to the staff and other users, with filings consistently being disseminated
in the same form as submitted to the Commission. Finally, the report concludes that provision of information through
the EDGAR system is at least as efficient and effective as in the paper filing system; in the case of dissemination,
the broadcast of material information is greatly enhanced, with electronic filings being made available nationwide,
if not worldwide, in a matter of minutes. 





Some interested parties have expressed the view that the EDGAR system's current design is no longer state-of-the-art
and that it should be reconfigured before phase-in recommences to reflect the newest available technologies that
would allow for the preparation and retrieval of filings that look more like traditional typeset paper filings, including
graphic and image material. The EDGAR project is, and always will be, dynamic in character. Some modifications already
are under consideration and the Commission and staff will be vigilant in the ongoing evaluation of the system to make
it as accessible and easy to use as possible. However, the staff reports that the current design successfully achieves
Congress' and the Commission's goal of immediate electronic access to the vital information required to be disclosed
pursuant to the federal securities laws and regulations, and that further costs and delays to overhaul a system that
is currently functioning well are not now warranted. 

While not recommending the complete replacement of the EDGAR design, some public commenters have voiced concerns
about other perceived weaknesses in the current system. Some argued that EDGARLink is not as user-friendly as it should
be, or that it should be available for use with other types of system platforms or with networks. Others asserted that
the procedures for payment of filing fees to the lockbox depository, while not technically an EDGAR issue, sometimes
affects the timeframe for acceptance of EDGAR filings. Some filers assert that too much electronic tagging is required,
while some disseminators advocate the addition of more tagging. The report states that the most pressing concerns
have been given a high priority, and solutions have already been implemented or are underway; future needs for enhancements
and design changes will be addressed in due course. Again, while these concerns are taken seriously, they do not approach
a level, either individually or collectively, that merits further delay in fully implementing the electronic filing
program.

<TEXT>
 

In view of the foregoing, and based on the recommendations of the staff, the Commission announces that the interim
EDGAR rules adopted in February 1993, as amended, are hereby made final and applicable to all domestic registrants
and third parties filing with respect to those registrants. Division of Corporation Finance and Investment Management
filers will be phased in in accordance with the phase-in schedule attached as Appendix A. An updated comprehensive
phase-in list of Corporation Finance registrants also is provided as Appendix B,
 and a revised phase-in list for filers whose documents are processed by the Division of Investment Management is included
as Appendix C.
 Phase-in will recommence with Groups CF-05 and IM-03, whose filings made on or after January 30, 1995 will
be required to be made electronically, as governed by Regulation S-T.
 Subsequent phase-in groups will become subject to mandated electronic filing, as provided in the revised phase-in
schedules.
 As is true with all rules promulgated by the Commission, all persons making filings with the Commission, including
those making third-party filings with respect to electronic registrants, are responsible for apprising themselves
of their new obligations associated with filing on the EDGAR system. While the staff attempts to contact registrants
in each phase-in group by furnishing a copy of the EDGAR Filer Manual and EDGARLink software prior to phase-in, filers
will not be relieved of their electronic filing obligations in the absence of such notification. 








III. Amendments to EDGAR Rules



The staff has gained substantial experience with the EDGAR system and its implementing regulations since the first
mandated filings were made in April 1993, and determined that certain refinements to its electronic filing rules
would be desirable. Proposed amendments were published for comment in July 1994.
 The Commission received seven comment letters with respect to the proposed changes.
 With few exceptions, to be addressed below in the context of specific rule changes, the proposed amendments were well
received by the commenters. Consequently, the Commission has determined to adopt the amendments in nearly all cases
as proposed; modifications to accommodate commenters' concerns will be identified below. Many of the amendments
are minor changes affecting substantive filing requirements (several of which represent codifications of staff
interpretations), or clarifying language in the current requirements in an effort to enhance filers' understanding
of their electronic filing obligations. Others consist of matters involving Commission procedures and practices
as well as technical corrections to the rules adopted previously. The specific amendments are addressed below.

A. Changes to Regulation S-T 



Regulation S-T, which controls the preparation and submission of electronic filings to the Commission, is
amended as described below. 

 

Rule 12(b) of Regulation S-T.

 Regulation S-T is amended to codify that electronic filers are permitted to submit filings on diskette and magnetic
tape to the Commission's Operations Center in Alexandria, Virginia. Filers who file on diskette and magnetic tape
may prefer to send them directly to the Operations Center to expedite acceptance processing of their submissions,
since diskettes and tapes sent to the Commission's headquarters must be forwarded to the Operations Center for processing.


 

New Rule 13(d) of Regulation S-T.

 Exchange Act Rule 14a-6(b) provides that definitive proxy statements may be ``filed with, or mailed for filing
to, the Commission not later than the date such material is first sent or given to any security holder.''

30

 Similar provisions are found in other Commission rules.

31

 Although electronic filers could mail diskettes or magnetic tapes, those choosing to file by direct transmission
do not currently have this option. Instead, they must file before or on the date the paper counterpart is mailed to investors;
such filing date must be a business day of the Commission. Paper filers (or those using diskettes or magnetic tape)
have more flexibility, because not only can they satisfy their filing obligations by putting copies in the mail to
the Commission at the time of distribution (thus allowing the actual filing to occur after the distribution), they
also can satisfy their filing obligation by mailing on Saturday or Sunday, an option not available to direct transmission
filers. To place electronic filers on the same footing with paper filers with respect to these filing requirements,
the Commission proposed that a new provision be added to Regulation S-T allowing electronic filers to file their
definitive proxy materials (or other documents, as applicable) before or on the date the paper distribution is made,
or if the distribution does not occur on a business day of the Commission, as soon as practicable on the next business
day. The change has been adopted as proposed. 






 

Rule 101(a)(1)(i) of Regulation S-T.

 The Regulation S-T list of mandated electronic submissions has been revised to specifically include prospectuses
filed under the Securities Act.

32

 





 

Rule 101(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S-T.

 The Regulation S-T list of mandated electronic submissions has been revised to specifically exclude Form 13F

33

 from the list of mandated electronic filings, consistent with other rule provisions and codifying current staff
interpretations.

34

 






 

New Rule 101(b)(3) of Regulation S-T.

 As proposed, all employee benefit plans will be permitted to file their entire annual report on Form 11-K

35

 in paper or in electronic format.

36

 Prior to this amendment, Regulation S-T required Forms 11-K to be filed electronically,

37

 but registrants were allowed to file any financial statements and schedules prepared in accordance with the financial
reporting requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'')

38

 in paper under cover of Form SE.

39

 Four commenters responded to the Commission's solicitation of views on the treatment of Forms 11-K. All supported
relief from electronic presentation for at least a portion of the financial information required in these reports.
Two indicated that electronic filing should be completely optional. Another supported optional electronic filing
at least for annual reports filed by ERISA plans. The final commenter believed that Forms 11-K should continue
to be filed electronically, with the paper submission under cover of Form SE being restricted. Because of the unique
nature and purpose of reports on Form 11-K, together with the staff's experience in implementing the Form 11-K
requirements involving Form SE, the rules are being adopted as proposed. 









 New Rules 101(b)(4) and (5) of Regulation S-T. The following filings will be explicitly included among
those allowed to be submitted in electronic format, consistent with other rule provisions and current staff interpretations:

Reports on Form 13F, filed with the Commission by institutional investment managers as required by Section 13(f)(1)

40

 of, and Rule 13f-1

41

 under, the Exchange Act, on magnetic tape in the format described in Form 13F-E;

42

 and 







Exhibits to Form N-SAR

43

 except that the Financial Data Schedule required under Rule 483 under the Securities Act 

44

 must be filed in electronic format.

45

 







 

Rule 101(c) of Regulation S-T.

 The following filings will be required to be filed in paper rather than electronically, codifying current staff interpretations,
as proposed: 

Form F-6, for registration under the Securities Act of depositary shares represented by American Depositary
Receipts;

46

 





Annual reports filed with the Commission by indenture trustees pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act;

47

 





Applications for an exemption from Exchange Act reporting obligations filed pursuant to Section 12(h) of the Exchange
Act;

48

 and 





Information relating to employee benefit plan transactions required to be filed pursuant to Rule 16b-3(b)(2)(ii)

49

 under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

50

 






 

Rule 101(c)(2) of Regulation S-T.

 The rules governing the submission of supplemental information are being revised, as proposed, to specify that such
information should be furnished in paper only if the submitter requests that the information be returned after staff
review and where the information is of the type typically returned by the staff pursuant to Rule 418(b) of Regulation
C or Rule 12b-4 of Regulation 12B.

51

 This change does not affect the current provision requiring that supplemental information submitted in connection
with a confidential treatment request be submitted in paper. 





 

Rule 101(c)(3) of Regulation S-T.

 The provision exempting shareholder proposal submissions from electronic filing has been clarified to state that
all correspondence relating to shareholder proposals submitted to the staff pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8


52

 should be filed in paper. 





 

Rule 101(c)(8) of Regulation S-T.

 A reference to the Commission's regional offices has been amended to reflect current nomenclature. 

 

Rule 101(c)(10) of Regulation S-T.

 As proposed, the exclusion from electronic filing afforded to promotional material and sales literature has been
expanded to include all such materials supplementally furnished to the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance.
The exclusion previously had been limited to materials submitted pursuant to Securities Act Industry Guide 5.

53

 The exclusion also has been expanded to specify the exclusion of sales literature submitted under Rule 24b-2

54

 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act''),

55

 consistent with that rule.

56

 








 

Rule 102(a) of Regulation S-T.

 Prior to the amendment adopted today, Rule 102(a) of Regulation S-T stated that ``[e]xhibits to an electronic
filing that have been filed previously in paper may, but shall not be required to be, restated in electronic format.''


57

 That language has been clarified, as proposed, by stating that exhibits incorporated by reference from filings previously
made in paper (either before becoming subject to mandated electronic filing requirements or pursuant to a hardship
exemption) may be, but are not required to be, refiled in electronic format.

58

Rule 102(e) of Regulation S-T. 

Rule 102(e) of Regulation S-T has been amended to clarify the requirement that, after a date three years after
its phase-in date, a registered investment company or business development company may incorporate by reference
only documents filed electronically. Specifically, the amendments clarify that the exemption in the rule for documents
filed in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption would be applicable only if any required confirming copy has been submitted.
The rules also now provide that an exhibit, filed in paper, to Form N-SAR

59

 may be incorporated by reference into another Form N-SAR filing. 




 

Rule 302(b) of Regulation S-T. 

In order to avoid any filer misunderstanding of the current requirement to retain a manually signed signature page
or other signature authentication document, the Commission is clarifying the rule to specifically require a manual
signature with respect to each signatory to the electronic filing. 

 

New Rule 302(c) of Regulation S-T. 

As proposed, Commission rules no longer will require manual signatures on the paper copies of electronic filings
required to be furnished by filers to national securities exchanges and national securities associations.

60

 





 

New Rules 303(a)(3) and (4) of Regulation S-T. 

The following are added to the list of documents that may not be incorporated by reference, consistent with other rule
provisions

61

 and current staff interpretations: 




For a registered investment company or a business development company making electronic submissions more than three
years after its phase-in date, a document which has not been filed in electronic format, unless the document has been
filed in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption and any required confirming copy has been submitted or the document
is an exhibit, filed in paper, to Form N-SAR, and is being incorporated by reference into another Form N-SAR
filing. 

For investment company filings, any Financial Data Schedule required under Securities Act Rule 483.

62

 





 

Rule 304(a) of Regulation S-T. 

Under the amended rules, descriptions of omitted graphic and image material will be allowed to be placed either in
the text of an electronic filing where the omission occurs or in an appendix thereto, at the option of the filer. Registrants
no longer will be required to list all omitted material in an appendix to the filing. Descriptions should be provided
in narrative or tabular format, as appropriate. 

 

Rule 304(d) of Regulation S-T. 

Phased-in registrants subject to the requirement to furnish a stock performance comparison graph in their proxy
statements pursuant to Item 402(

l

) of Regulation S-K

63

 will be required to satisfy that obligation in their electronic filing in the same manner as applicable to other types
of omitted charts or graphs, that is, by describing the omitted performance graph by presenting the graph's data points
in tabular form.

64

 The requirement to furnish a paper copy of the performance graph to the Branch Chief in the Division of Corporation
Finance responsible for the review of the registrant's filings is retained, in order to allow the staff to continue
monitoring information as distributed to investors.

65

 As proposed, the option to file the graph in paper under cover of Form SE

66

 is eliminated to prevent the possibility of an incomplete electronic presentation to the reader without reference
to the Form SE. 







 

New Rule 311(b) of Regulation S-T. 

The rule governing filing of exhibits in paper under cover of Form SE has been amended as proposed to provide that exhibits
to a Commission schedule filed pursuant to Section 13 or 14(d) of the Exchange Act may be filed in paper under cover of
Form SE where such exhibits previously were filed in paper (either before becoming subject to mandated electronic
filing or pursuant to a hardship exemption) and are required to be refiled pursuant to the schedule's general instructions.
In the past, such documents were required to be filed in electronic format along with the schedule to which they relate,
absent a hardship exemption.

67

New Rule 311(c) of Regulation S-T. 

Under the amended rules, insurance companies that file information included in their annual statements provided
to state insurance regulators (

i.e.

, Schedules O and P)

68

 as exhibits to their Forms 10-K will be allowed to file such documents in paper under cover of Form SE because of
difficulties in translating them into a format compatible with EDGAR.

69

 





 

Rule 311(d) of Regulation S-T. 

The revisions also codify the staff's interpretation that a Financial Data Schedule is not among those exhibits to
Form N-SAR that an investment company may submit in paper under cover of Form SE. 
 

Rules 901(a) and 902(a) of Regulation S-T. 

As proposed, a note has been added to Rules 901 and 902 of Regulation S-T to make it clear that registrants become
subject to mandated electronic filing upon their phase-in date and all subsequent filings must be made electronically,
even filings made with respect to transactions that commenced prior to, and are in process, at the time a registrant
is phased in.

70

 The note to Rule 902(a) also clarifies the limited exception for definitive filings by investment companies under
Securities Act Rule 497. 




 

Rule 901(c)(4) of Regulation S-T. 

A note has been added to Rule 901 of Regulation S-T explaining that while entities subject to mandated electronic
filing generally may choose to electronically file Schedules 13D

71

 and 13G

72

 with respect to a paper filer, domestic electronic filers are restricted from doing so with respect to foreign private
issuers because EDGAR currently requires an Internal Revenue Service tax identification number to be inserted for
the subject company as a prerequisite to acceptance of the filing. It is anticipated that the EDGAR system will be modified
in the future to process such filings, but until that time, they should be filed in paper.

73

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941230-0-00103 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941230-0-00019 </PARENT>

Rules 901(d) and 902(g) of Regulation S-T.

 Since mandated electronic filing began in April 1993, filers have been required to furnish to the Commission a paper
copy of each electronic filing made during the first year following phase-in. This rule was adopted to implement Section
35A(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.

74

 Since its proposal in 1992, filers have characterized the requirement as burdensome. In response, the Commission
proposed reducing the paper submission requirement so that filers could satisfy their paper copy obligations by
furnishing a paper copy of their first electronic filing only. Four commenters addressed the issue. Three supported
the reduction, characterizing the paper submission requirement as ``wasteful'' and ``unnecessary.'' One commenter
argued that the format of electronic filings is not as desirable to read as copies of paper documents, implying that
electronic filings are not suitable alternatives to paper filings. While it is true that electronic filings often
are not as aesthetically pleasing as typeset paper versions, the content of the filing, not its typeface, is what is
of interest to investors. Furthermore, this argument carries little weight against reducing the paper copy requirement,
since filers may satisfy such requirement by furnishing a paper printout of the electronic filing. 





In light of the comments to the proposal, and in connection with the six-month evaluation of the EDGAR system, the Commission
has reviewed the paper copy requirement and procedures. As stated in the report, the EDGAR system is reliable, provides
a suitable alternative to written and printed filings, and provides information as effectively and efficiently
for filers, users and disseminators as the written or printed counterpart.

75

 Consequently, the requirement has been modified, as proposed, to require new electronic filers to furnish to the
Commission one paper copy of their first electronic filing only.

76

 Pursuant to a commenter's suggestion, the paper copy rule also is being clarified to state that persons making third
party filings, such as proxy materials or beneficial ownership reports, with respect to an electronic registrant
also are required to submit a paper copy with their first electronic filing only. 






 

Rule 902(e) of Regulation S-T.

 The amendments clarify the limited exception contained in Rule 902(e) of Regulation S-T

77

 for definitive filings by investment companies under Rule 497 of the Securities Act, to mandated electronic filing.

B. Changes to Item 601 of Regulations S-K and S-B 



Item 601 of Regulations S-K and S-B, which govern the filing of exhibits, including the new Financial Data
Schedule, are amended as described below. 

 The exhibit tables of Regulations S-K and S-B have been amended as proposed to indicate that charter
documents are to be filed with quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q

78

 and 10-QSB

79

 pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of Regulations S-K

80

 and S-B

81

 if such documents had been amended during the reporting period, thereby reflecting the requirements of Item 601(a)(4)
of Regulations S-B and S-K.

82


 








 Item 601 of Regulations S-K and S-B has been amended to state that if an instrument defining the rights
of security holders is in the form of a certificate, the text appearing on the certificate must be reproduced in an electronic
filing, together with a description of any other graphic and image material appearing on the certificate.

83

 





 Item 601(b)(10) of Regulations S-K and S-B has been amended to clarify that a material contract
that becomes effective or that is executed during the reporting period reflected by an annual or quarterly report
must be filed as an exhibit to the periodic report filed for the corresponding period.

84

 The amended rules also make it clear that only new material contracts must be filed with quarterly reports; Forms 10-Q
and 10-QSB, unlike Forms 10-K and 10-KSB, do not require a list of all material contracts. 





 Applications filed for the purpose of determining the eligibility of a person designated as trustee for debt
securities registered under the Securities Act that are eligible to be issued, offered, or sold on a delayed basis
by or on behalf of the registrant, pursuant to Section 305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act,

85

 will now be required to be filed separately in the manner prescribed by the EDGAR Filer Manual.

86

 Prior to this amendment, such filings were required to be filed as an exhibit to a post-effective amendment to the registration
statement to which the application relates. This change is intended to provide expedited processing of such filings.
Of course, the general procedure requiring all other trust indenture eligibility applications on Form T-1
and T-2

87

 to be submitted as an exhibit to the registration statement remains intact.

88

 








 Item 601 also has been amended to clarify that earnings statements ``made generally available'' pursuant
to  11(a) of the Securities Act

89

 should be filed as an exhibit to Exchange Act periodic reports only where the statement was made available using methods
other than including the information in another filing with the Commission, as provided by Securities Act Rule 158.

90

 






 As proposed, Financial Data Schedules will not be required to be filed in connection with registration statements
on Form S-8

91

 (for registration of securities issued pursuant to employee benefit plans), since updated financial information
is rarely included in such filings.

92

 






 A note has been added to Item 601(c) of Regulations S-K and S-B, providing that the paper copy of an
electronic filing sent to the Commission's Operations Center in Alexandria, Virginia pursuant to Rule 901(d) of
Regulation S-T need not contain any Financial Data Schedule included in that filing. Similarly, registrants
will not be required to furnish paper versions of their Financial Data Schedules with the paper copies sent to national
securities exchanges and national securities associations pursuant to Commission rules.

93

 Both provisions are consistent with the Commission's position, also codified in the note, that paper copies of the
Schedule are not required with filings made in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption because the Schedule merely
reflects information found elsewhere in the filing, and thus, it is only useful in electronic filings.

94

 






C. Changes to Securities Act Rule 483 and Form S-6



The following amendments to rules and forms under the Securities Act and Investment Company Act in connection with
Financial Data Schedule requirements have been adopted as proposed: 

 A note has been added to Securities Act Rule 483(e) indicating that paper copies of Financial Data Schedules
are not required to be furnished to the Commission or to national securities exchanges or national securities associations.

95

<DOCNO> FR941230-0-00105 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

 Form S-6
 has been amended to make it clear that a Financial Data Schedule is required only upon the filing of an amendment to a
registration statement on that form. 




D. Changes to Public Utility Act Rules and Forms 


The following amendments to the Public Utility Act Rules and Forms have been adopted as proposed: 
 Forms U5B,
 U5S,

98

 and U-1
 under the Public Utility Act have been amended to state that if an instrument defining the rights of security holders
is in the form of a certificate, the text appearing on the certificate must be reproduced in an electronic filing.
 







E. Other Changes 


Other amendments are listed below. 
 As proposed, Exchange Act Rule 12b-15
 has been amended to specify the number of copies required to be filed in connection with amendments to Exchange Act
filings made in paper. 




 An electronic filing provision of Regulation 13D relating to electronic amendments to Schedules 13D and 13G
has been amended to track its parallel provision in Regulation S-T.
 




 A note to Exchange Act Rule 
14a-4

103

 codifies the Commission's position that proxy cards should be filed as appendices at the end of proxy statements filed
in electronic format, and not as separate documents within the electronic submission.
 In a similar vein, Instruction 3 to Item 10 of Schedule 14A
 now instructs electronic registrants to file employee benefit plan documents required to accompany the proxy statement
as appendices to the proxy statement. As in the past, filers are not required to deliver the plan documents to shareholders
unless they are a part of the proxy statement. 






 Item 22(a)(4) of Schedule 14A has been amended to clarify that the Financial Data Schedule, required to be submitted
by investment companies with certain proxy materials, would be submitted as an exhibit to the proxy statement. 
 Technical revisions have been made to the cover pages of proxy and information statements to make them easier
to understand and expedite processing.
 The rules have been revised to clarify that the cover page is for the use of the Commission and is not required to be distributed
to security holders.
 Further, a change has been made to Schedule 14A to ensure that the approximate date on which the proxy statement and
form of proxy are first sent or given to security holders must be printed on the first page of the proxy statement sent
to investors, and not on the cover sheet.
 






 The tender offer rules have been amended as proposed to make it clear that tender offer periods are tolled because
of failure to file required documents in electronic format only when the bidder is required to file electronically
or, if applicable, after it has elected to do so by filing the Tender Offer Statement in electronic form.
 While this has always been the intended reading of the EDGAR provisions of the tender offer rules, questions have been
raised as to whether the time periods would be tolled under other circumstances. 




 The number of paper copies of Form SE (for use with documents filed in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption
or other specified purposes) and Form TH
 (used in connection with paper filings pursuant to a temporary hardship exemption) required to be filed has been increased
from three to four, to facilitate processing by the staff. 




III. Common Mistakes Made by EDGAR Filers 


Since the adoption of the interim rules in February 1993, the Commission staff has been working with electronic filers
to help them satisfy their electronic filing obligations. The Commission has issued the following list of staff suggestions
to help electronic filers avoid some of the more common errors associated with electronic filing.
 




 Filers should review documents in electronic format and error check using EDGARLink prior to transmitting
documents for filing. For example, filers should check to make sure they are filing on the correct form type and are
using accurate CIK and CCC numbers.

 Care must be taken to use <TEST> and <CONFIRMING-COPY> tags correctly; submissions with these tags are
not official Commission filings. 
 Filing fees in connection with good-money filings must be paid to the lockbox before or at the time the filing
is made. Filers should allow time for wire transfers prior to filing. 
 Filers should be prepared to file early to avoid last-minute filing problems, especially in connection with
time-sensitive filings. 
 Filers have an obligation to confirm the status of their filings after transmitting them to the Commission.
Filing date adjustments
 will be made, as warranted, for Exchange Act reports, but generally will not be granted to backdate a filing over an
extended period of time. It is not staff policy to grant filing date adjustments for Securities Act registration statements
or other transactional filings, since shareholder rights may be affected. 




IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis 


The costs and benefits associated with mandated electronic filing generally were addressed in earlier releases
associated with the adoption of the EDGAR interim rules, which today are being made final. In summary, the Commission
stated that while some costs attend the implementation of an electronic filing system, for the Commission, filers
and users, the benefits far outweigh the costs. Filers avoid uncertainty and delays that may occur with courier delivery
or other modes of transportation used in connection with paper filings. Filing hours are extended for electronic
submissions and acceptance processing is immediate, giving filers greater flexibility and control over when filings
are made. Filers may avoid multiple submission of the same information by transmitting once a modular submission
for inclusion in multiple documents. Filers will enjoy further facilitation in satisfying their filing obligations
once one-stop filing with self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') and the states is fully implemented.
 Users and disseminators benefit even more from the EDGAR system's capabilities to identify, sort and broadcast time-sensitive
information to the nation and the world in a matter of minutes. Investors and financial markets benefit from the immediate
access to information the system provides. 




One commenter, responding to the Commission's general request for comments on the EDGAR system, asserts that the
Commission never considered the potential burdens imposed on small businesses by the EDGAR system, as currently
designed. To the contrary, in the release adopting the interim rules it was noted specifically that the EDGAR rule
proposals elicited comment relating to the costs of: purchasing electronic equipment; hiring financial printers
to file Forms 10-K because of their complexity; training employees to prepare and file electronic documents
in an unfamiliar format; and preparation and review of paper documents in addition to electronic versions of those
documents. The Commission recognized that registrants (including all those defined as small entities) and others
who are required to file on the EDGAR system would incur additional compliance costs. It was anticipated, however,
that those filing electronically also would enjoy the benefits related to electronic filing, as set forth above.

In the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, the impact electronic filing would have on small entities was explicitly
considered and several alternative approaches were addressed. It was determined to be in the public interest to have
a complete database available through the system. Furthermore, small entities themselves would benefit from the
broad and immediate dissemination of their disclosure documents into the marketplace. Finally, a delayed implementation
schedule for the smallest companies was adopted to allow more than ample time for these entities to acquire the necessary
equipment (most of which is basic to today's modern workplace, absent EDGAR) and training as modest resources permit.
The views expressed in the foregoing documents have been supported by the experience gained in the nearly 20 months
since mandated electronic filing began. 
No commenter addressed the costs and benefits of the amendments to the general EDGAR rules that were proposed in July
1994. Given the technical and minor nature of the amendments, they are not expected to affect significantly the costs
and burdens associated with filing requirements generally, or specifically with respect to electronic filing.

Division of Corporation Finance EDGAR Transition.


(a) * * *





Note to paragraph (a): 

Registrants become subject to mandated electronic filing on their phase-in date. Consequently, all documents required
to be filed in electronic format pursuant to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T ( 232.101) filed on or after a registrant's
phase-in date must be filed electronically, absent a hardship exemption, even if the transaction to which a filing
relates was commenced in paper before the phase-in date and is still in process on the registrant's phase-in date.


See 

Rule 101(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S-T, that provides for optional paper filing of a Form 10-K or 10-KSB
if it is the first document filed after a registrant's phase-in date.


* * * * *


(c) * * *
(4) * * * 

 



Note to paragraph (c)(4): 

While companies subject to mandated electronic filing generally may choose to electronically file Schedules 13D
and 13G with respect to a paper filer, domestic electronic filers are restricted from doing so with respect to foreign
private issuers because EDGAR currently requires an IRS tax identification number to be inserted for the subject
company as a prerequisite to acceptance of the filing. Such filings should be made in paper until the EDGAR system is
modified to process them electronically.

Note to paragraph (a):

 Registrants become subject to mandated electronic filing on their phase-in date. Consequently, all documents required
to be filed in electronic format pursuant to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T ( 232.101) filed on or after a registrant's
phase-in date must be filed electronically, absent a hardship exemption, even if the transaction to which a filing

paragraph (e) of this section, that provides for optional paper filing of certain filings under Rule 497 under the
Securities Act of 1933 ( 230.497 of this chapter). 


* * * * * 


(e) 

Required Electronic Filing for Phased-in Filers.

 A registrant that is phased in, under either the mandatory electronic filing provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), or
(c) or by reassignment under paragraph (d) of this section, shall file electronically all filings which are mandated
electronic submissions under Rule 101 of Regulation S-T ( 232.101 of this chapter) and which are made
on or after a registrant's phase-in date, 

provided, however

 that a registrant need not file electronically a filing, after the registrant's phase-in date, under Rule 497 under
the Securities Act of 1933 ( 230.497 of this chapter) that relates solely to a registration statement or post-effective
amendment filed prior to the registrant's phase-in date and is submitted for the purpose of filing the definitive
prospectus and/or statement of additional information for that registration statement or amendment. A registrant
submitting electronically a Rule 497 filing for the purpose of ``stickering'' its prospectus and/or statement of
additional information need not submit electronically the prospectus and/or statement of additional information
to which the ``sticker'' relates, provided that the text of the prospectus and/or statement of additional information
has already been filed electronically as a public document. 


* * * * *

Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rules.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is adopting an updated edition of the EDGAR Filer Manual and is providing for its incorporation by reference
into the Code of Federal Regulations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission today announces the adoption of an updated EDGAR Filer Manual (``Filer Manual''), which sets forth
the technical formatting requirements governing the preparation and submission of electronic filings through
the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system.

1

 Compliance with the provisions of the Filer Manual is required in order to assure the timely acceptance and processing
of filings made in electronic format.

2

 Filers should consult the Filer Manual in conjunction with the Commission's rules governing mandated electronic
filing when preparing documents for electronic submission.

3

 In this update, new form types have been added to reflect disclosure rule changes and various technical enhancements.
Rule 301 of Regulation S-T also is being amended to provide for the incorporation by reference of the Filer Manual
into the Code of Federal Regulations, which incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal
Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The revised Filer Manual and the amendment to Rule 301
will be effective on January 30, 1995. 






Paper copies of the updated Filer Manual may be obtained at the following address: Public Reference Room, U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, Mail Stop 1-2, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Electronic format copies
will be available on the EDGAR electronic bulletin board. Copies also may be obtained from Disclosure Incorporated,
the paper and microfiche contractor for the Commission, at (800) 638-8241. 
Since the Filer Manual relates solely to agency procedure or practice, publication for notice and comment is not required
under the Administrative Procedure Act.

4

 It follows that the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act

5

 do not apply. 





Statutory Basis 


The amendment to Regulation S-T is being adopted under Sections 6, 7, 8, 10, and 19(a) of the Securities Act of
1933,

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) amends its regulations relating to the
administration of the Food and Agricultural Sciences National Needs Graduate Fellowship Grants Program conducted
under the authority of section 1417(b)(6) of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy
Act of 1977, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 3152(b)(6). This action is being taken to clarify certain aspects of the program,
provide additional guidance to applicants so that the material submitted facilitates the evaluation of proposals,
and add newly applicable Federal statutes and regulations. CSREES is publishing these regulations in their entirety
to enhance their use by the public and to ensure expeditious submission and processing of grant proposals.




In addition, this rule amends 7 CFR chapter XXXIV to reflect the abolishment of the Cooperative State Research Service
(CSRS) and the establishment of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service in the recent Department
of Agriculture reorganization.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 23, 1994, CSRS published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 48978-48985) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on the revision of the administrative provisions
for the Food and Agricultural Sciences National Needs Graduate Fellowship Grants Program.



Public Comment



In the NPRM, CSRS invited comments on the proposed regulations for consideration in the formulation of a final rule.
No comments were received in response to the invitation in the NPRM. With the exception of changing the references
to CSRS to CSREES, there are no differences between the NPRM and these final regulations.



Paperwork Reduction



Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the collection of information
requirements contained in this rule have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and
given the OMB Document Nos. 0524-0022 and 0524-0024.



Classification



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order No. 12866 and it has been determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' rule because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
and materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. This rule will not create any serious inconsistencies
or otherwise interfere with actions taken or planned by another agency. It will not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs and does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising
out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order No. 12866. In addition,
it will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, Public Law No. 96-534 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.).

This rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order No. 12778, Civil Justice Reform, and the required certification
has been made to OMB. All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule are preempted. No retroactive
effect is to be given to this rule. This rule does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit
in court.



Regulatory Analysis



Not required for this rulemaking.



Environmental Impact Statement



This regulation does not significantly affect the environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is
not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq

.



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance



This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.210, Food and Agricultural Sciences
National Needs Graduate Fellowship Grants. For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule-related Notice to 7 CFR Part
3015, subpart V, 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983, at which time the authority to administer this program resided in the Agricultural
Research Service, this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order No. 12372 which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials.



Background and Purpose



Under the authority of section 1417(b)(6) of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy
Act of 1977, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 3152(b)(6), the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to conduct a competitive
graduate fellowship grants program. This action amends the administrative regulations governing the Food and Agricultural
Sciences National Needs Graduate Fellowship Grants Program published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 13 1987 (52 FR 4712-4716), and on January 22, 1990 (55 FR 2214-2215).



Establishment of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service



Pursuant to Public Law 103-354, the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization
Act of 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture issued Secretary's Memorandum 1010-1, Reorganization of the Department
of Agriculture, on October 20, 1994. That memorandum orders the abolishment of the Cooperative State Research Service
and the establishment of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service which assumes the function
previously performed by the Cooperative State Research Service. This rule includes amendments to 7 CFR chapter XXXIV
which are necessary to bring agency regulations into alignment with the departmental reorganization.

sciences targeted for national needs fellowships, that have a significant ongoing commitment to the food and agricultural
sciences generally, and that have a significant ongoing commitment to the specific subject area for which a grant
application is made. It is the objective to award grants to colleges and universities which have notable teaching
and research competencies in the food and agricultural sciences. The grants are specifically intended to support
fellowship programs that encourage outstanding students to pursue and complete a graduate degree at such institutions
in an area of the food and agricultural sciences for which there is a national need for the development of scientific
and professional expertise. Therefore, institutions which currently have excellent programs of graduate study
and research in the food and agricultural sciences dealing with targeted national needs are particularly encouraged
to apply.



Subpart B_Program Description



 3402.4 

Food and agricultural sciences areas targeted for national needs graduate fellowship grants support.



Areas of the food and agricultural sciences appropriate for fellowship grant applications are those in which developing
shortages of expertise have been determined and targeted by HEP for national needs fellowship grant support. When
funds are available and HEP determines that a new competition is warranted, the specific areas and funds per area will
be identified in a 

Federal Register

 notice announcing the program and soliciting program applications.



 3402.5 

Overview of National Needs Graduate Fellowship Grants Program.



(a) The program will provide funds for a limited number of grants to support fixed graduate student stipends and fixed
cost-of-education institutional allowances. These grants will be awarded competitively to eligible institutions.
In order to encourage the development of special activities that are expected to contribute to Fellows' advanced
degree objectives, the program will also provide competitive, special international study or thesis/dissertation
research travel allowances for a limited number of USDA Graduate Fellows.

(b) Based on the amount of funds appropriated in any fiscal year, HEP will determine:

(1) Whether new competitions for graduate fellowships and/or special international study or thesis/dissertation
research travel allowances will be held during that fiscal year;

(2) The graduate degree level(s) to be supported_Master's and/or doctoral;

(3) The proportion of appropriations to be targeted for the fellowship stipends for each respective graduate degree
level supported;

(4) The proportion of appropriations to be targeted for the cost-of-education institutional allowances for each
respective graduate degree level supported;

(5) The proportion of appropriations to be targeted for the special international study or thesis/dissertation
research travel allowances for each respective graduate degree level supported;

(6) The allowable stipend amount for each respective graduate degree level supported, the cost-of-education institutional
allowance for each respective graduate degree level supported, and the maximum funds available for each special
international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance for each respective graduate degree level
supported; and

(7) The maximum total funds that may be awarded to an institution under the program in a given fiscal year.

(c) HEP will also determine:
(1) The maximum number of national needs areas for which funding may be requested in a single proposal;
(2) The degree levels for which funding may be requested in a single proposal;
(3) The minimum and maximum number of fellowships for which an institution may apply in a single proposal; and
(4) The limits on the total number of proposals that can be submitted by an institution, college, school, or other administrative
unit. 
(d) All of these determinations will be published as a part of the program announcement in the 

Federal Register

.(e) For each USDA Graduate Fellow who desires to be considered for a special international study or thesis/dissertation
research travel allowance, the project director must apply to HEP for a supplemental grant in accordance with instructions
published in the program announcement in the 

Federal Register

. Each application must include an ``Application for Funding'' (Form CSRS-661) and a ``Budget'' (Form CSRS-55).
(1) To provide HEP with sufficient information upon which to evaluate the merits of the requests for a special international
study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance, each application for a supplemental grant must contain
a narrative which provides the following:
(i) The specific destination(s) and duration of the travel;
(ii) The specific study or thesis/dissertation research activities in which the Fellow will be engaged;
(iii) How the international experience will contribute to the Fellow's program of study;
(iv) A budget narrative specifying and justifying the dollar amount requested for the travel;
(v) Summary credentials of the faculty or other professionals with whom the Fellow will be working during the international
experience (summary credentials must not exceed three pages per person; ``Summary Vita_Teaching Proposal'' (Form
CSRS-708) may be used for this purpose);
(vi) A letter from the dean of the Fellow's college or equivalent administrative unit supporting the Fellow's travel
request and certifying that the travel experience will not jeopardize the Fellow's satisfactory programs toward
degree completion; and
(vii) A letter from the fellowship grant project director certifying the Fellow's eligibility, the accuracy of the
Fellow's travel request, and the relevance of the travel to the Fellow's advanced degree objectives.
(2) The narrative portion of the application must not exceed 10 pages, excluding the summary vita/vitae.
(f) All complete requests will be evaluated by professional staff from USDA or other Federal agencies, as appropriate.
Evaluation criteria will be published in the program announcement in the 

Federal Register

. Awards will be made to the extent possible based on availability of funds.
(g) Any current fellow with sufficient time to complete the international experience before the termination date
of the grant under which he/she is supported is eligible for a special international study or thesis/dissertation
research travel allowance. Before the international study or thesis/dissertation research travel may commence,
a Fellow must have completed one academic year of full-time study, as defined by the institution, under the fellowship
appointment and arrangements must have been formalized for the Fellow to study and/or conduct research in the foreign
location(s).


 3402.6

Fellowship appointments.


(a)(1) Fellows must be identified and fellowships must be awarded within 15 months of the effective date of a grant.
Institutions failing to meet this deadline will be required to refund monies associated with any unawarded fellowship(s).
Fellowship appointments may be held only by persons who enroll and pursue full-time study in a graduate degree program
in the national need area and at the degree level supported by the grant.
(2) In addition, fellows:
(i) must be newly recruited;
(ii) must not have been enrolled previously in the academic program at the same degree level; 
(iii) must be citizens of nationals of the United States as determined in accordance with Federal law; and
(iv) must have strong interest, as judged by the institution, in pursuing a degree in a targeted national need area
and in preparing for a career as a food or agricultural scientist or professional.
(3) It will be the responsibility of the grantee institution to award fellowships to students of superior academic
ability.
(4) A doctoral Fellow who maintains satisfactory progress in his or her course of study is eligible for support for
a maximum of 36 months within a 45-month period. Master's level Fellows, maintaining satisfactory progress, are
eligible for support for a maximum of 24 months during a 33-month period. However, it is the intent of this program that
Fellows pursue full-time uninterrupted study or thesis/dissertation research, including time spent pursuing
USDA-funded special international study or thesis/dissertation research activities. For Fellows requiring additional
time to complete a degree, it is expected that the institution will endeavor to continue supporting individuals originally
appointed to fellowships through such other institutional means as teaching assistantships and research assistantships.
For Fellows who complete the program of study early (less than 24 hours for Master's degree or 36 months for doctoral
degree), the institution must refund any unexpended monies to the granting agency.

(b) Within the framework of the regulations in this part, all decisions with respect to the appointment of Fellows
will be made by the institution. However, institutions are urged to take maximum advantage of opportunities for awarding
fellowships to members of underrepresented groups at the graduate level in the food and agricultural sciences, particularly
minorities and women. Throughout a Fellow's tenure, the institution should satisfy itself that the Fellow is making
satisfactory academic progress, and carrying out, or planning to carry out, national needs related research. If
an institution finds it necessary to terminate support of a Fellow for insufficient academic progress or by decision
on the part of the Fellow, the Fellow becomes ineligible for future assistance under the program. If a Fellow finds
it necessary to interrupt his or her program of study because of health, personal reasons, outside employment, or
acceptance of an assistantship, the institution must reserve the funds for the purpose of allowing the Fellow to resume
funded study any time within a 9-month period. However, a Fellow who finds it necessary to interrupt his or her program
of study more than one time cannot exceed a total of 9 months' cumulative leave status without forfeiting eligibility.
For fellowships terminated because of insufficient academic progress, a decision on the part of the Fellow, or reserved
due to an interrupted program of study but not resumed within the required time period, unexpended monies must be refunded.
Institutions may not use unexpended monies associated with a terminated fellowship to recruit and support a ``replacement''
Fellow.

(c) Only Fellows enrolled in Master's programs of study may be supported under a Master's fellowship grant. Only Fellows
enrolled in doctoral programs of study may be supported under a doctoral fellowship grant.



 3402.7 

Fellowship activities.



A Fellow must be enrolled as a full-time graduate student, as defined by the institution, at all times during the tenure
of the fellowship in the national need area and at the degree level supported by the grant. This includes the time used
for special international study or thesis/dissertation research if the international travel is funded through
a special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance under this grant program. However,
the normal requirement of formal registration during part of this tenure may be waived if permitted by the policy of
the fellowship institution, provided that the fellow is making satisfactory progress toward degree completion
and remains engaged in appropriate full-time fellowship activities such as thesis/dissertation research. Fellows
in academic institutions are not entitled to vacations as such. They are entitled to the short normal student holidays
observed by the institution. The time between academic semesters or quarters is to be utilized as an active part of
the grant period. During the period of support, a Fellow may not accept employment by the institution or any other agency.
However, a grant supporting research costs of the Fellow is acceptable, exclusive of salary or wages and fringe benefits
for the Fellow.



 3402.8 

Financial provisions.



The basis fellowship stipend, cost-of-education institutional allowance, and special international study or
thesis/dissertation research travel allowance that may be paid from grant funds will be determined by HEP contingent
upon appropriations. The amount of the stipend, cost-of-education institution allowance, and special international
study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance will be cited in the program announcement in the 

Federal Register

. An institution may elect to apply the cost-of-education institutional allowance to a Fellow's tuition and fees;
however, such is not required. The allowance also may be used by an institution to defray other program expenses (e.g.,
recruitment, travel, publications, or salaries of project personnel). Tuition and fees are the responsibility
of the Fellow unless an institution elects to use its cost-of-education institutional allowance for this purpose
or elects to pay such costs out of other non-USDA monies. No dependency allowances are provided for Fellows. Stipend
payments and special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowances will be made to Fellows
by the institution, according to standard institutional procedures for fellowships and assistantships.

National need narrative.



A narrative for the national need area should be written in five sections limited to no more than 20 pages, and preceded
by a table of contents. The table of contents is not considered part of the 20-page limitation. The narrative should
be typed on one side of the page only, using a font no smaller than 12 point, and double-spaced. The five sections to be
included in the narrative are as follows:





Sec. 1. In this section, applicants should establish clearly that the proposed program of study and research will
result in the development of outstanding expertise in the national need area for which funding is requested and will
do so in a reasonable period of time. Applicants should present a detailed description of the proposed graduate program
of study and research. This section of the narrative should contain, but need not be limited to, the following components:

(a) The plan should specifically address the course work which Fellows will be required to take rather than the overall
spectrum of departmental offerings. Identify courses, summarize content, and discuss sequencing. Explain how
course work will relate to Fellows' research.

(b) Identify and describe areas of research that Fellows will be encouraged to engage in via a thesis or dissertation.

(c) Discuss graduate program examination requirements, such as a proficiency or qualifying examination, a comprehensive
examination, and an oral examination.

(d) Include a projected timetable for completing the proposed graduate program of study and research.

(e) If admission to a proposed doctoral program does not require a Master's degree, discuss how institutional procedures
allow for the bypass of a Master's degree.

Sec. 2. In this section, applicants should highlight thoroughly any special features of the graduate program such
as the extent to which it will involve an inter-disciplinary, multi-disciplinary, or cross-disciplinary approach
resulting in the development of expertise transcending a single discipline. Applicants should also discuss any
other special features such as development of an unusual collateral specialization in a related discipline, experiential
learning opportunities such as practicums or internships, unique mentoring programs, seminars, or a multi-university
collaborative approach.

should discuss the extent to which graduate students have access to such institutional resources.
Sec. 4. In this section, applicants should document thoroughly the institution's plans and procedures for managing
fellowship appointments. Applicants should explain in-depth the plan for recruiting academically outstanding
Fellows and procedures for selecting Fellows of superior quality who appear to be highly motivated to prepare for
and pursue a career as a food or agricultural scientist or professional. In addition, applicants should cite specific
plans for advising and guiding Fellows through a program of study, as well as any special programs or activities that
will be offered to enrich the Fellows' graduate study. Particular attention should be given to the plans and procedures
for recruiting and retaining members of underrepresented groups.

Sec. 5. In this section, applicants should include important supplementary summary data for the institution relevant
to the national need area for which funding is requested. Examples of appropriate data are indices of student quality,
enrollments and degrees awarded for recent years, placement of graduates, facilities, faculty research support,
and publications of previous graduate students. To the extent possible, applicants should present the supplementary
summary data in tabular form.



 3402.13 

Budget.



Applicants must prepare the Proposal Budget, Form CSRS-703, identifying all costs associated with the proposal.
Instructions for completing the ``Proposal Budget'' are provided on the form. Pagination for the budget page should
be continuous following the national need narrative and so indicated in the table of contents.



 3402.14 

Faculty vitae.


This section should include a Summary Vita, Form CSRS-708, for each faculty member contributing significantly
to institutional competence at the level of graduate study for the national area addressed in the proposal. Applicants
should arrange the faculty vitae with the project director(s) first, followed by the remaining faculty, in alphabetical
order. Pagination for the faculty vitae should be continuous following the budget page and so indicated in the table
of contents.



 3402.15 

Appendix.


Any additional supporting information deemed essential for clarifying and/or strengthening the proposal should
be included in an Appendix and referenced in the national need narrative. To the extent possible, applicants should
present supporting information included in the Appendix in tabular form. Pagination for the Appendix should be continuous
following the faculty vitae and so indicated in the table of contents.


Subpart D_Submission of a Proposal



 3402.16 

Intent to submit a proposal.

 3402.24 

Access to peer review information.



After final decisions have been announced, HEP will, upon request, inform the project director of the reasons for
its decision on a proposal. Verbatim copies of summary reviews, not including the identity of the reviewers, will
be made available to respective project directors upon specific request.



 3402.25 

Documentation of progress on funded projects.



(a) A Fellowship Appointment Documentation form (Form CSRS-707) is included in the application package. Upon
request by HEP, project directors awarded grants under the program will be required to complete and submit this form.
Follow-up progress reports will focus on assessing continuing progress of Fellows through their graduate programs
of study (including activities supported by any special international study or thesis/dissertation research allowance)
and on institution adherence to program guidelines.

(b) A Graduate Fellow Exit Report (Form CSRS-709) is included in the application package. This form should be
completed and submitted to HEP by the project director for each Fellow supported by a grant as soon as a Fellow either:
graduates; is officially terminated from the fellowship or the academic program due to unsatisfactory academic
progress; or voluntarily withdraws from the fellowship or the academic program. If a Fellow has not completed all
degree requirements at the end of the five-year grant duration, HEP may request a preliminary exit report. In such
a case, a final exit report will be required at a later date. When a final exit report for each Fellow supported by a grant
has been accepted by USDA, the grantee institution will have satisfied the requirement of a final performance report
for the grant. Additional follow-up reports to track the Fellows' career patterns may be requested.

(c) A Final Report must be completed and returned within 90 days after the expiration date of the project. The Final
Report must be submitted to the program contact person and must contain proper data and information as specified in
the ``Special Terms and Conditions'' of the award. Generally, the Final Report should include a summary of: recruitment
strategies that were effective; successful mentoring procedures or activities; enrichment activities the fellows
were afforded; barriers faced in recruiting and graduating fellows; and the impact of the fellowship grant on the
overall quality of the educational programs of the institution.



 3402.26 

Evaluation of program.



Grantees should be aware that HEP may, as a part of its own program evaluation activities, carry out in-depth evaluations
of assisted activities through independent third parties. Thus, grantees should be prepared to cooperate with evaluators
retained by HEP to analyze both the institutional context and the impact of any supported project.

Career and Career-Conditional Employment





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing interim regulations to continue existing requirements under
which career-conditional employees acquire career tenure and reinstatement eligibility. At present, these requirements
are in provisionally retained chapter 315 of the former Federal Personnel Manual. Issuance of this interim rule will
prevent a lapse in Governmentwide requirements when chapter 315 expires on December 31, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Regulations covering career-conditional appointments in the Federal service are in 5 CFR part 315. The career-conditional
appointment is the initial permanent appointment to competitive service positions. Upon satisfying certain conditions,
a career-conditional employee acquires career tenure, which provides higher retention standing and unlimited
reinstatement eligibility.



Currently, 5 CFR 315.201(a) requires 3 years of creditable service for an employee to acquire career tenure. Section
315.201(b) provides that OPM will publish in the Federal Personnel Manual the conditions under which service may
be credited in meeting the 3-year requirement. 

As recommended by the National Performance Review, OPM abolished the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) in December
1993. At the time, FPM Chapter 315 on the career-conditional appointment system was provisionally retained through
December 1994 to enable OPM to issue regulations to replace needed instructions found only in the FPM, including the
conditions under which service is credited toward career tenure. 

The FPM instructions also specify the conditions under which reinstatement eligibility of career-conditional
employees may be extended beyond the 3-year period set in 5 CFR 315.401. Reinstatement eligibility permits an individual
to be rehired without competing in a competitive civil service examination. (Career employees and preference eligible
career-conditional employees have unlimited reinstatement eligibility.)

On October 20, 1994, OPM issued proposed revisions to conditions for acquiring career tenure and reinstatement eligibility
(59 FR 52925). Because the comment period ends on December 20, 1994, OPM will have insufficient time to issue final
rules on that proposal to be effective January 1, 1995, and prevent a lapse in Governmentwide requirements for career
tenure and reinstatement. To assure that employees continue to acquire career tenure and reinstatement eligibility
under the same set of conditions, OPM is adopting in 5 CFR part 315 the existing requirements for career tenure that
are in section 2-4, subchapter 2, and for reinstatement eligibility in section 4-2, subchapter 4, of the
provisionally retained chapter 315 of the former Federal Personnel Manual. 

Changes from the FPM instructions are limited to editorial revisions and inclusion of existing requirements in interchange
arrangements with other merit systems that OPM approved under 5 CFR  6.7. 



Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date 



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking.
Also, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), I find that good cause exists to make this amendment effective in less than 30
days. This regulation is effective immediately to continue existing longstanding rules from the Federal Personnel
Manual that determine employees' retention standing and eligibility for reinstatement. It would be contrary to
the public interest to allow these Governmentwide rules to expire when the Manual expires on December 31, 1994. The
delay in the effective date is being waived to prevent any lapse in coverage of these rules. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it pertains only to Federal employees and agencies.

 315.201

Service requirement for career tenure.



(a) 

Service requirement. 

A person employed in the competitive service for other than temporary, term, or indefinite employment is appointed
as a career or career-conditional employee subject to the probationary period required by subpart H of this part.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an employee must serve 3 years of substantially continuous creditable
service as defined in paragraph (b) of this section to become a career employee.

(b) 

Creditable service. 

Unless otherwise approved by OPM, the service required for career tenure must begin and end with nontemporary employment
in the competitive service except as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, must include service under an
appointment based on or leading to competitive status, be substantially continuous, and total 3 years, as follows:

(1) 

Nontemporary employment. 

To be creditable, the 3-year period of service must begin with one of the following:

(i) Nontemporary appointment in the competitive service. For this purpose, nontemporary appointment includes
a career-conditional appointment; career appointment; reinstatement under subpart D of this part; and transfer
under subpart E of this part. The 3-year period may also begin, but not end, with status quo employment under subpart
G of part 316 of this chapter, and overseas limited appointment of indefinite duration or overseas limited term appointment
under part 301 of this chapter. The 3-year period also may have begun with permanent employment under now obsolete
appointing authorities such as probational, war service indefinite, and emergency indefinite appointments. Determinations
of whether an obsolete authority provides the basis for creditable service may be obtained from OPM;

(ii) The acquisition of competitive status on January 23, 1955, under provisions of Executive Order 10577, while
serving in the excepted service;

(iii) Nontemporary appointment from a civil service register to a position in the excepted service before January
23, 1955;

(iv) Nontemporary appointment to a position in the District of Columbia Government before January 23, 1955, evidencing
selection in regular order from a civil service register used to certify for probational appointment in the Federal
service. Appointment from a register maintained only for District of Columbia Government would not meet this condition;

(v) Nontemporary appointment to an excepted position, 

provided the employee's excepted position was brought into the competitive service 

and, on that basis, the employee acquired competitive status or was converted to a career or career-conditional appointment;

(vi) Nontemporary appointment to a nonappropriated fund (NAF) position in or under the Department of Defense, 

provided the employee's NAF position was brought into the competitive service 

and, on that basis, the employee acquired competitive status or was converted to a career or career-conditional appointment;

(vii) Nontemporary excepted or nonappropriated fund appointment, Foreign Service appointment, or appointment
in the Canal Zone Merit System, provided the employee is appointed or transferred to a competitive service position
under the terms of an interchange agreement with another merit system under  6.7 of this chapter, under Executive
Order 11219 as amended by Executive Order 12292, or under Executive Order 11171;

(viii) The date of appointment to a position on the White House Staff or in the immediate office of the President or Vice
President, provided the service has been continuous and the individual was appointed to a competitive service position
under  315.602 of this chapter;

(ix) The date of nontemporary excepted appointment under Schedule B,  213.3202 of this chapter, provided the
student's appointment is converted to career or career-conditional appointment under Executive Order 12015;

(x) The date of veterans readjustment appointment (VRA), provided the appointment is converted to career or career-conditional
appointment under  315.705 of this chapter, or the person is appointed from a civil service register without
a break in service while serving under a VRA;

(xi) The date of nontemporary appointment to the Postal Career Service or the Postal Rate Commission after July 1,
1971, provided the individual is appointed to a career or career-conditional appointment under 39 U.S.C. 1006;

(xii) The date of nontemporary appointment under Schedule A,   213.3102(t) or 213.3102(u) of this chapter,
of a mentally retarded or severely physically handicapped person, provided the employee's appointment is converted
to career or career-conditional appointment under  315.709 of this chapter;

(xiii) The date of appointment as a Presidential Management Intern under Schedule A,  213.3102(ii) of this
chapter, provided the employee's appointment is converted to career or career-conditional appointment under  315.708;

(xiv) The date of temporary appointment pending establishment of a register, provided the appointment was converted
to career executive assignment;

(xv) The date of temporary appointment pending establishment of a register (TAPER), provided:
