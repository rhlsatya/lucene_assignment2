FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 








Bank Holding Companies and Change in Bank Control; Investment Adviser Activities 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board seeks public comment on a proposal to revise its interpretive rule regarding investment adviser activities
of bank holding companies to allow a bank holding company and its bank and nonbank subsidiaries to purchase in their
sole discretion in a fiduciary capacity, securities of an investment company advised by the holding company if this
purchase is specifically authorized by the terms of the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court
order, or by the law of the jurisdiction under which the trust is administered. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 



In 1972, the Board permitted bank holding companies to serve as an investment adviser to mutual funds and other registered
investment companies. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4). When the Board added this activity to Regulation Y, it also published
an interpretive rule that placed certain prudential and other limitations on the manner in which bank holding companies
could conduct the activity. 12 CFR 225.125. 

Among the restrictions in the interpretive rule is a requirement that a bank holding company and its bank and nonbank
subsidiaries should not purchase, in its sole discretion in a fiduciary capacity, any securities of an investment
company advised by the bank holding company. 12 CFR 225.125(g). The Board adopted the restriction because of concern
that a bank holding company might use its position as a fiduciary to support an investment company that the bank holding
company advised, to increase the asset size of the investment company or as a means of increasing advisory fees. 

A number of bank holding companies have recently indicated that a mutual fund advised by the bank holding company is
often the most cost-effective method of providing investment advice to customers and is increasingly attractive
to customers because a mutual fund provides customers with a readily marketable and easily valued investment product.

1

 These bank holding companies point out that a number of statutory and regulatory developments have occurred since
1972 that address the concerns that originally prompted the Board to adopt its prohibition on fiduciary purchases
by a bank holding company of shares of a mutual fund advised by the bank holding company. In light of these developments,
several bank holding companies have requested that the Board modify its current interpretive rule to permit bank
holding companies to purchase, on behalf of fiduciary customers, shares of mutual funds advised by the bank holding
company. 




Since the Board adopted its investment advisory interpretive rule, Congress enacted section 23B of the Federal Reserve
Act, which specifically permits a bank or its subsidiary to purchase securities, as a fiduciary, from an affiliate
if such purchases are permitted by the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court order, or by the law
of the jurisdiction governing the fiduciary relationship. In addition, in an analogous area, the Board since permitted
fiduciary purchases of securities that are underwritten by a section 20 affiliate if the purchase was specifically
authorized under the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court order, or by the law of the jurisdiction
under which the trust is administered.

Both the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have recently permitted
the banks that they regulate to purchase, in a fiduciary capacity, securities of an investment company advised by
an affiliate of the bank if the purchase is specifically authorized by the terms of the instrument creating the fiduciary
relationship, by court order, or by local law.
 Moreover, many states have amended their laws to allow banks to engage in these types of transactions.
 





The Board now proposes to modify its investment advisory interpretive rule to provide that a bank holding company
and its bank and nonbank subsidiaries may purchase in their sole discretion in a fiduciary capacity, securities of
an investment company advised by the bank holding company if this purchase is specifically authorized by the terms
of the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court order, or by the law of the jurisdiction under which
the trust is administered. To assure that fiduciary customers are aware of the potential conflicts of interest that
may arise, the proposed change would contain a requirement that the bank holding company disclose, in writing at the
time that the fiduciary relationship is created, to its fiduciary customer, that it, or an affiliate, serves as investment
adviser to the investment company whose shares are purchased in a fiduciary capacity. These purchases would also
be governed by fiduciary principles that require the purchase to be made on market terms. The Board seeks comment on
the proposed disclosure requirement and whether it is adequate to assure that fiduciary customers are aware of potential
conflicts of interest. In particular, the Board seeks comment on whether the required written disclosure should
be given to a fiduciary customer immediately prior to each initial investment in an investment company advised by
the bank holding company. 


II. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 95-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System certifies that the proposed regulation will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities that would be subject to the regulation. This revision will
not place additional burdens on any bank holding company. It will clarify the rules as they currently apply to all bank
holding companies.

Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure

 The National Credit Union Administration.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) proposes to amend a provision of the Uniform Rules of Practice and
Procedure pertaining to ex parte contacts. The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (Board of Governors), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of Thrift Supervision
(OTS) have all proposed to make this same change to the Uniform Rules, and are publishing separate notices of proposed
rulemaking. This proposal is intended to clarify that the Uniform Rules' provisions relating to ex parte communications
conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In particular, this proposal would clarify
that the ex parte provisions do not apply to intra-agency communications, which are governed by a separate provision
of the APA.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Section 916 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Public Law 73, 103
Stat. 183 (1989) required the NCUA, OCC, Board of Governors, FDIC and OTS (collectively ``the agencies'') to develop
uniform rules and procedures for administrative hearings. The agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking
on June 17, 1991 (56 FR 27790) and promulgated their final Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure in August 1991 (NCUA,
56 FR 37767, August 8, 1991; OCC, 56 FR 38024, August 9, 1991; Board of Governors, 56 FR 38052, August 9, 1991; FDIC, 56
FR 37975, August 9, 1991; and OTS, 56 FR 38317, August 12, 1991). The NCUA and other agencies now independently propose
to amend one aspect of the Uniform Rules relating to ex parte communications to clarify that those rules parallel the
requirements of the APA. 

Currently, section 747.9 of the Uniform Rules prohibits a party, the party's counsel, or another interested person
from making an ex parte communication to the NCUA Board or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory
proceeding. When the Uniform Rules were proposed, the joint proposed rule (56 FR 27790, 27793) explained that the
proposed rule regarding ex parte communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding
ex parte communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed
by the APA.

<DOCNO> FR941230-1-00006 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941230-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decisionmakers. The APA's ex parte communication
provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] 

outside the agency''

 and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis
added). 

Intra-agency

 communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits
enforcement staff at an agency from participating or advising in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review
of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel. The same separation of function
provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party on a fact in issue unless the other
parties have an opportunity to participate. 5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation of functions provision does not prohibit
agency enforcement staff from seeking the amendment of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding.


Section 747.9 of the Uniform Rules as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, commingled the ex parte and separation
of functions concepts, thereby allowing the ex parte communication prohibition to be applied to all communications
concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the agency head, ALJ, or decisional personnel and any
party, the party's counsel, or another person interested in the proceeding. The NCUA and other agencies did not intend
this provision to limit agency enforcement staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to, or terminations of,
existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however, the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the ex parte
communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. 

The proposed amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting
the prohibition on ex parte communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,''
5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d).
This approach is also consistent with the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference
of the United States (ACUS). ACUS, 

Model Adjudication Rules

 (December, 1993). 



II. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the NCUA hereby certifies that this proposed rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility
analysis is not required. 

This proposal would make a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place and affects intra-agency procedure
exclusively. Thus, it will not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the proposal
is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute. 



III. Executive Order 12612 Statement 



This proposed rule, like the current provision of Part 747 it is replacing, will apply to all federally insured credit
unions. The NCUA Board, pursuant to Executive Order 12612, has determined, however, that the proposed rule will not
have a substantial direct effect on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states,
or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. Further, the proposed rule
will not preempt provisions of state law or regulations.

Authority and Issuance 



For the reasons set out in the preamble, 12 CFR part 747 is proposed to be amended as set forth below: 



PART 747_ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS, ADJUDICATIVE HEARINGS, RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, AND INVESTIGATIONS


1. The authority citation for part 747 is revised to read as follows: 







Authority:

 12 U.S.C. 1766, 1784, 1786, 1787. 




2. In  747.9, paragraphs (a) and (b) are revised and a new paragraph (e) is added to read as follows: 



 747.9 

Ex parte communications. 



(a) 

Definition. 

(1) 

Ex parte communication 

means any material oral or written communication relevant to the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding that was neither
on the record nor on reasonable prior notice to all parties that takes place between_

(i) An interested person outside the NCUA (including such person's counsel); and 

(ii) The administrative law judge handling that proceeding, the NCUA Board, or a decisional employee. 

(2) 

Exception. 

A request for status of the proceeding does not constitute an ex parte communication. 

(b) 

Prohibition of ex parte communications. 

From the time the notice is issued by the NCUA Board until the date that the NCUA Board issues its final decision pursuant
to  747.40(c): 

(1) No interested person outside the NCUA shall make or knowingly cause to be made an ex parte communication to any member
of the NCUA Board, the administrative law judge, or a decisional employee; and 

(2) No member of the NCUA Board, administrative law judge, or decisional employee shall make or knowingly cause to
be made to any interested person outside the NCUA any ex parte communication. 



* * * * * 



(e) 

Separation of functions. 

Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law, the administrative law
judge may not consult a person or party on any matter relevant to the merits of the adjudication, unless on notice and
opportunity for all parties to participate. An employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting
functions for the NCUA in a case may not, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision,
recommended decision, or agency review of the recommended decision under  747.40, except as witness or counsel
in public proceedings.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to adopt a new 
airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to 
certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) Model F90, 
and 99, 100, and 200 series airplanes. The proposed 
action would require installing a circuit breaker on 
the landing gear motor control panel assembly. A 
report where excessive current flow caused the 
electrical landing gear motor and wiring to catch fire 
on a Beech Model 200 airplane prompted the proposed 
action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are 
intended to prevent excessive current flow through the 
electrical landing gear motor, which, if not corrected, 
could cause an airplane fire.

Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by 
submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office 
of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules 
Docket No. 94-CE-24-AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64106. 



Discussion 



The FAA has received a report where excessive 
current flow caused the electrical landing gear motor 
and wiring to catch fire on a Beech Model 200 airplane. 
Investigation revealed that the right main landing gear 
actuator assembly jammed, causing the actuator to slow 
or stall the landing gear motor. This caused the motor 
to use excessive current, which caused smoke to fill 
the cockpit and cabin. 

Other incidents where the landing gear motor used 
excessive current have been reported; however, in these 
incidents, airplane safety was not an issue.

Beech has issued Service Bulletin No. 2035, 
Issued: February 1985; Revised: August 1990, which 
specifies procedures for preparing the airplane for the 
installation of a circuit breaker on the landing gear 
motor control panel assembly of certain Beech Model 
F90, and 99, 100, and 200 series airplanes. The 
instructions included with the following kits specify 
instructions for installing this circuit breaker: 
101-3069-1 S, 101-3069-3 S, 101-3069-5 S, and 101-3133-1 S.

After examining the circumstances and reviewing 
all available information related to the incidents 
described above, the FAA has determined that AD action 
should be taken to prevent excessive current flow 
through the electrical landing gear motor, which, if 
not corrected, could result in an airplane fire. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other Beech Model F90, 
and 99, 100, and 200 series airplanes of the same type 
design, the proposed AD would require installing a 
circuit breaker on the landing gear motor control panel 
assembly. The proposed action would be accomplished 
in accordance with Beech SB No. 2035, Issued: February 
1985; Revised August 1990; and the instructions to the 
applicable Landing Gear Motor Circuit Breaker 
Installation Kit (specified above). 

The FAA estimates that 2,297 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 6 workhours (varies between 2 
to 6 workhours depending on the airplane model) per 
airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that 
the average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. 
The cost per parts varies by airplane model; however, 
for purposes of this proposed AD, $1,000 is utilized. 
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$3,137,702. This figure is based on the assumption 
that no U.S. operator of the affected airplanes has 
accomplished the proposed installation. 

Beech has informed the FAA that approximately 
2,100 installation kits have been sold. Assuming that 
each of these kits is installed on one of the affected 
airplanes, the proposed cost impact on U.S. operators 
would be reduced by $2,868,600 from $3,137,702 to 
$369,102. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in 
the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by

This document contains proposed regulations on the definition of private activity bonds applicable to tax-exempt
bonds issued by States and local governments. Changes to the applicable law were made by the Deficit Reduction Act
of 1984 (the 

1984 Act

), the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the 

1986 Act

), the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, and the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. These regulations affect issuers of tax-exempt bonds and provide guidance for
applying the private activity bond restrictions.

Background

Explanation of provisions 



I. Background of regulations



Section 103 provides generally that interest on certain States or local bonds (

tax-exempt bonds

) is excluded from gross income. Section 103(b)(1) provides, however, that private activity bonds (other than qualified
bonds) are not tax-exempt bonds. Section 141 provides that a bond is a private activity bond if the issue of which the
bond is a part satisfies either the private business tests or the private loan financing test. The private business
tests of section 141(b) are satisfied if the issue satisfies both the private business use test, which relates to the
use of the bond proceeds, and the private security or payment test, which relates to the manner in which the issue is
secured or will be repaid. Section 141(c) provides that the private loan financing test is satisfied if the lesser
of $5 million or 5 percent of the proceeds of an issue are to be used to make or finance loans to persons other than governmental
units.

Regulations relating to the private business tests under section 103(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (the


1954 Code

), the predecessor to section 141(b), are contained in  1.103-7 (the 

industrial development bond regulations

.) These regulations have not been amended since their finalization shortly after the enactment of section 103(b)
of the 1954 Code. Since 1972 many changes have occurred in the financing practices of State and local governments.
In addition, the 1984 Act and the 1986 Act made a number of significant changes to the private business tests. These
changes include reductions in the permissible amounts of private business use and private security or payments,
new limitations for certain types of bonds (for example, issues for output facilities), and modifications to the
private business use and private security or payment tests. Importantly, however, the 1986 Act legislative history
states that, to the extent not amended, principles of prior law continue to apply. The industrial development bond
regulations have not been amended to reflect the changes to the private business tests made in the 1984 Act or the 1986
Act. Finally, the industrial development bond regulations do not provide guidance on the private loan financing
test.

This document proposes to amend the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) by replacing the industrial development
bond regulations under  1.103-7 with comprehensive regulations addressing the private business tests
and the private loan financing test. This document also contains proposed regulations that would replace other guidance
found in various pronouncements of the Service (for example, Notice 87-69, 1987-2 C.B. 378, Notice 89-9,
1989-1 C.B. 630, Rev. Proc. 93-17, 1993-1 C.B. 507, and Rev. Proc. 93-19, 1993-1 C.B.
526). This document also proposes certain related rules in the Income Tax Regulations, including rules for qualified
bonds under section 141(e), qualified 501(c)(3) bonds under section 145, arbitrage allocation rules under  1.148-6,
definitions in  1.150-1, changes in use under section 150 (b) and (c), and enterprises zone facility bonds
under section 1394. In the process developing the proposed regulations, the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury
considered the public comments received with respect to the industrial development bond regulations and other existing
guidance.



II. Description of proposed regulations



A. In general



The proposed regulations substantially revise the industrial development bond regulations to provide more comprehensive
guidance, including numerous examples. Further, in contrast to the industrial development bond regulations, the
rules and definitions in the proposed regulations, the rules and definitions in the proposed regulations are coordinated
with the rules in the arbitage regulations under section 148 and the rules in section 150 that apply generally for tax-exempt
bond purposes.



B. Section 1.141-1 Definitions and rules of general application



1. 

In general. 

The proposed regulations generally provide a number of definitions that apply for all purposes of section 141. Further,
for many terms, the definitions that apply for arbitrage purposes are made applicable for purposes of section 141.
Selected definitions are discussed below.

2. 

Proceeds.

 The proposed regulations define proceeds as including sale proceeds, disposition proceeds, and any replaced amounts.
Further, proceeds include earnings on nonpurpose investments that accrue during the project period but generally
exclude sale proceeds used to retire the issue.

3. 

Replaced amounts.

 The industrial development bond regulations do not specifically address when amounts that are replaced by bond proceeds
are treated as proceeds under section 141. The proposed regulations provide that certain replacement proceeds (as
defined for arbitrage purposes) are treated as proceeds for purposes of section 141.

4. 

Disposition proceeds.

 The industrial development bond regulations also do not specifically address the application of the provisions
of section 141 after the issue date. The proposed regulations provide that disposition proceeds, defined as amounts
derived from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property financed with the proceeds of an issue, are treated
as proceeds of the issue. Under this approach, the property transferred generally ceases to be allocable to proceeds
of the bonds and is no longer taken into account under section 141. Instead, the amounts received from the transfer
of the property are treated as proceeds of the issue for purposes of analyzing continuing compliance with the private
activity bond limitations. In order to provide administrative simplicity for issuers of large, multiproject financings,
the proposed regulations provide a special exception for property financed with certain general obligation issues.

5. 

Partnerships.

 Under the private business tests, use of proceeds by any person other than a natural person is treated as trade or business
use. The proposed regulations provide rules for determining under which circumstances use by a partnership is disregarded
and, instead, treated as use by the partners of that partnership.



C. Section 1.141-2 Private activity bond tests



1. 

In general.

 An issue must satisfy both the private business use test and the private security or payment test for the bonds of the
issue to be private activity bonds under the private business tests of section 141(b). Alternatively, bonds are private
activity bonds if the private loan financing test of section 141(c) is satisfied.

2. 

Reasonable expectations and deliberate actions.

 The industrial development bond regulations do not specifically address the effect of actions taken after the issue
date. The proposed regulations generally provide that whether bonds are private activity bonds is determined on
the basis of the issuer's reasonable expectations on the issue date. An issuer's reasonable expectations are determined
in the same manner as under the arbitrage regulations.

The proposed regulations also provide that a deliberate action by the issuer occurring subsequent to the issue date
and resulting in satisfaction of the private activity bond tests causes the bonds to be private activity bonds. Importantly,
many post-issuance transfers will not result in private activity bond characterization if the issuer does not use
the disposition proceeds in an impermissible manner.



D. Section 1.141-3 Definition of private business use



1. 

General rules.

 Under the private business tests, a bond is a private activity bond only if the issue of which it is a part satisfies the
private business use test of section 141(b)(1). The private business use test of section 141(b)(1) is met if more than
10 percent of the proceeds of the issue is used in a trade or business carried on by a nongovernmental person. Any use
by a person other than a natural person is treated as use in a trade or business. The industrial development bond regulations
relating to the private business use test do not provide specific guidance for many common situations that arise in
municipal financings.

2. 

General definition of private business use.

 A principal goal of the proposed regulations is to provide more complete rules to identify whether proceeds, or the
facilities financed with those proceeds, are used for a private business use. The proposed regulations provide that
use of proceeds generally results from ownership or leasing of financed property, a loan of proceeds, or other actual
or beneficial use of financed property under a management or incentive payment contract, output contract, or other
arrangement. As under the industrial development bond regulations, private business use can result from either
direct or indirect use of the proceeds as well as from either the ultimate use of the proceeds or an intermediate use
of the proceeds.

3. 

Discharge of primary legal obligation.

 The proposed regulations provide that a bond-financed facility is indirectly used by a nongovernmental person if
the provision of that facility discharges a primary and unconditional obligation of the nongovernmental person.

4. 

Management contracts.

 For management and other incentive payment contracts, the proposed regulations implement the directive of section
1301(e) of the 1986 Act and liberalize the safe harbors contained in Rev. Proc. 93-19. The proposed regulations
provide that management contracts other than qualified management contracts result in private business use of the
related facility. The proposed regulations expand the categories of qualified management contracts to include
the following: (a) Contracts with terms not exceeding the lesser of 15 years or 50 percent of the useful life of the property
if all the compensation is based on a periodic fixed fee; (b) contracts with terms not exceeding the lesser of 10 years
or 80 percent of the useful life of the property if at least 80 percent of the annual compensation is based on a periodic
fixed fee; (c) contracts with terms not exceeding 5 years if at least 50 percent of the compensation is based on a periodic
fixed fee; and (d) contracts with terms not exceeding 3 years if all of the compensation is based on a per-unit fee. The
proposed regulations make a number of other changes in the qualified management contract rules in response to comments
received with respect to Rev. Proc. 93-19.

5. 

Exception for general public use.

 The proposed regulations provide more complete guidance, including certain bright line tests and numerous examples,
for purposes of determining whether use is use as a member of the general public. These rules include a definition of
general public use, guidance on the circumstances when general public use is insubstantial, special rules for system
improvements, and guidance for facilities that are integrally related to other facilities.
6. 

De minimis exceptions.

 In order to simplify the application of the private business use test, the regulations provide that certain de minimis
uses are disregarded. First, leases and similar arrangements that are not renewed or renewable and have terms of less
than 1 year are generally disregarded. Second, certain temporary use by developers of property that will be sold to
the general public is also disregarded in applying the private business use test. Third, as under Notice 87-69,
both incidental uses of a financed facility and qualified improvements of a facility are disregarded. The proposed
regulations revise the qualified improvement exception to simplify the application of these rules.


E. Section 1.141-4 Private security or payment test


1. 

General rules.

 Under the private business tests, a bond is a private activity bond only if the issue of which it is a part satisfies the
private security or payment test of section 141(b)(2). The private security or payment test relates to the security
for, and the source of the amounts used to pay, debt service on the bonds.
2. 

Application.

 The proposed regulations provide that the private security or payment test is applied by comparing the present value
of the private payments and security to the present value of the debt service on the issue. Present values are computed
using the yield on the issue as determined under the arbitrage regulations, with special rules provided for variable
yield issues. The private security or payment test is generally met if more than 10 percent of the principal of and interest
on the issue in the aggregate is to be secured or derived from certain property or payments described below.
3. 

Private payments.

 The private payments taken into account are payments, whether to the issuer or any related party, in respect of property
or borrowed money to be used for a private business use. Generally, any payments made by persons that satisfy the private
business use test are taken into account and the payments taken into account cannot exceed the corresponding proportion
of proceeds used by that person. In addition, payments from persons that are not private business users are taken into
account if those payments are made in respect of a private business use. For example, payments by the general public
for use of a facility that is managed by a nongovernmental person under a management contract that is not a qualified
management contract are taken into account as private payments.
4. 

Private security test.

 Private security includes any interest in property to be used for a private business use or payments in respect of property
or borrowed money to be used for a private business use that secures principal of and interest on the issue. Unlike private
payments, private security is taken into account if privately used property is the security for the bonds even if that
property is not financed with the proceeds of the issue.
5. 

Exception for generally applicable taxes.

 The proposed regulations provide that generally applicable taxes are disregarded under the private security or
payment test. Generally applicable taxes do not include special assessment or payments for a special privilege granted
or service rendered. Generally applicable taxes must have a general manner of determination and collection. The
regulations provide guidance on whether this requirement is satisfied if the taxpayer makes special arrangements
with respect to the tax (for example, agreements to be personally liable for a tax).
6. 

Waste remediation bonds.

 The proposed regulations incorporate the guidance in Notice 89-9, relating to bonds issued to finance certain
hazardous waste clean-up activities.


F. Section 1.141-5 Private loan financing test


1. 

General rules.

 Under the private loan financing test, a bond is a private activity bond if issued as part of an issue more than 5 percent
of the proceeds of which (or $5 million, if less) are used to make loans to nongovernmental persons. As with the private
business tests, both direct and indirect uses of proceeds are taken into account.

2. 

Definition of loan. 

Any transaction that is treated as a loan for federal tax purposes is a loan of proceeds. Generally, transactions that
result in an expenditure of proceeds, such as a grant, do not give rise to a loan. However, tax increment and similar
financings, in which proceeds are, in form, granted to a nongovernmental person with the debt service on the bonds
to be paid from incremental tax revenues may be treated as a loan if the recipient of the grant makes special agreements
regarding payment of the taxes (for example, an agreement not to contest the assessment).

3. 

Tax assessment bond exception. 

Section 141(c) provides that certain tax assessment loans are not treated as loans in applying the private loan financing
test. A tax assessment loan is a loan that arises from the imposition of a tax or assessment of general application for
specific, essential governmental functions. The proposed regulations generally define essential governmental
function to have the same meaning as under section 7871. To qualify for this special exception, owners of business
and nonbusiness property must be eligible to make assessment payments on an equal basis. Guidance is provided on the
types of special arrangements regarding payment of an assessment that cause the assessment to fail the equal basis
requirement (for example, due-on-sale clauses). The proposed regulations clarify that loans qualifying under
the tax assessment loan exception may still result in satisfaction of the private business tests.



G. Sections 1.141-3 and 1.141-6 Measurement of use and allocation and accounting rules



1. 

Measurement of private business use. 

The proposed regulations provide specific rules regarding the measurement of private use. For facilities that are
simultaneously used for both private business use and government use, the regulations generally permit the use of
reasonable methods of measuring the private business use. Thus, for a building with separate portions used for private
business use and government use, the amount of private business use is based on the relative portion of useable space
used for a private business use. If the private use occurs at different times, the private business use is based on a
comparison of private business use to total use. 

Except as described below for output facilities, annual periods are used to measure the amount of private business
use and the private business use is equal to the greatest amount of private business use in any annual period. As under
the industrial development bond regulations, the proposed regulations do not provide that private business use
is measured over the entire term of the issue, except for output facilities. For example, a stadium that is used for
private business use 30 days out of a total use of 200 days in one year generally meets the 10 percent private business
use test (regardless of the use of the facility in other years).

2. 

Financing a portion of a mixed use facility. 

If a facility is used for private business use in an amount that would cause the bonds to be private activity bonds, in
many circumstances the proposed regulations permit tax-exempt bonds to be issued for the government use portion
without causing the bonds to meet the private business use test. This special rule applies only if the government use
portion of the facility is a separate and discrete portion of a facility (such as a floor of a building), or an undivided
ownership interest in an output or similar utility facility. In applying this rule, an allocable portion of the cost
of common areas may be financed as government use. 

Generally, if the private business use of facility does not occur in a separate and discrete portion of the facility
or in an output or similar utility facility, the proposed regulations do not permit tax-exempt financing of any portion
of that facility. For example, for a stadium used 30 percent of the time for private business use, tax-exempt bonds
may not be issued to provide 70 percent of the cost of that stadium.

3. 

Allocation of proceeds to expenditures. 

The proposed regulations provide that the allocation of proceeds to expenditures for purposes of section 141 must
be made in the same manner as and consistently with allocations of proceeds for arbitrage purposes under  1.148-6.
As further described below, the proposed regulations would amend  1.148-6 to provide significant flexibility
regarding when these allocations are required to be made.

H. Section 1.141-7 Special rules for output facilities



1. 

General rule. 

The proposed regulations adopt the approach of the industrial development bond regulations providing special rules
for the determination of whether the purchase of the output of an output facility by a nongovernmental person causes
the bonds to be private activity bonds. These rules apply the private business use test to output contracts by comparing
the amount of output purchased by nongovernmental persons under take or take or pay contracts to the available output
of the facility. The proposed regulations provide certain additional clarifications. For example, the proposed
regulations clarify that certain requirements contracts are treated as take or take or pay contracts. Transitional
rules are provided for existing contracts. In modifying the rules for output facilities, the Service and Treasury
recognize that, as a result of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, significant regulatory changes are occurring regarding
electric generation and transmission facilities. In this regard, the proposed regulations attempt to address the
changing nature of this industry. For example, the proposed regulations provide guidance on allocations of use of
transmission facilities.

2. 

De minimis exceptions. 

The proposed regulations contain several de minimis exceptions under which output contracts are disregarded. First,
in lieu of the 3 percent de minimis rule in the industrial development bond regulations, the proposed regulations
adopt a 1 percent de minimis rule. The proposed regulations also incorporate the safe harbors in the 1986 Act legislative
history relating to pooling, exchange, and spot sale agreements. Special rules are also provided for use of transmission
facilities. Finally, contracts with terms not exceeding 1 year may be disregarded in certain circumstances.

3. 

Allocation of output contracts. 

The proposed regulations provide specific guidance on allocations of output sold under a contract among particular
facilities. Generally, these determinations are made on a facts and circumstances basis taking into account certain
physical and contractual factors.



I. Section 1.141-8  $15 million limitation for output facilities



1. 

General rules. 

Section 141(b)(4) provides a special private activity bond limitation for issues used to finance output facilities,
under which the permissible private business use and private security or payments are limited to $15 million. Further,
this $15 million limitation for an issue is reduced by the amount of private business use and private security or payments
in other outstanding tax-exempt bonds financing the same project.

2. 

Definition of project. 

The proposed regulations define project for purposes of the $15 million output limitation. Generating units not
located at the same site or not placed in service within 3 years are not part of the same project. In addition, improvements
made more than 3 years after a generating unit is placed in service are treated as a separate project. For transmission
facilities, a project includes functionally related or contiguous property placed in service during a single 24-month
period.



J. Section 1.141-9 Unrelated or disproportionate use test



Under section 141(b)(3), an issue meets the private business tests if the amount of private business use and private
security or payments attributable to any unrelated or disproportionate private business use exceeds 5 percent of
the proceeds. The proposed regulations provide that whether private business use is related to a government use of
the proceeds of an issue is determined on a case-by-case basis, emphasizing the operational relationship of the financed
facilities. Generally, facilities used for a private business use are related to a government use only if the private
use occurs in the same facility or an adjacent facility. The proposed regulations also provide that a single facility
that is used for both a government use and a private business use of the same type (for example, governmental and private
parking) generally does not result in unrelated use.

Disproportionate private business use occurs when the amount of proceeds used for a private business use exceeds
the amount of proceeds used for the related government use. The proposed regulations provide allocation rules designed
to simplify the application of the disproportionate use rules. For example, where a private business use relates
to more than one government use, in determining the amount of disproportionate use the private business use may be
allocated either entirely to the government use to which it primarily relates or among each of the government uses.
A number of examples are provided illustrating the application of the unrelated and disproportionate use rules.

K. Section 1.141-12 Special rules for qualified bonds



The proposed regulations provide certain limited guidance for purposes of applying the provisions of section 141(e),
relating to qualified private activity bonds (private activity bonds that qualify as tax-exempt bonds). Thus, generally,
continued compliance throughout the term of the issue is required for bonds to be qualified bonds. The proposed regulations
provide, however, that certain of the remedial actions under proposed  1.141-13 apply for this purpose.



L. Section 1.141-13 Deliberate actions and related remedial actions



1. 

Remedial actions

. Although a post-issuance deliberate action by an issuer may cause bonds to be private activity bonds, the proposed
regulations provide a number of remedial actions that will prevent bonds from ceasing to be tax-exempt bonds. In order
to be eligible for these remedial actions the issue must satisfy certain conditions. First, the issuer must covenant
in the bond documents that it will not take any action that would cause the bonds to be private activity bonds, and must
establish reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with this covenant. Second, the terms of any agreement that
would cause the bonds to be private activity bonds must be arm's-length. Third, as under the arbitrage regulations,
the issuer must certify its expectations as of the issue date regarding the amount and use of the proceeds. If, however,
the possibility that a deliberate action would be taken is not remote as of the issue date, remedial actions are generally
not available unless the bonds provide for redemption within 6 months of the deliberate action.

2. 

Permitted remedial actions

. The proposed regulations contain several remedial actions that are available in the event of a deliberate action.
First, the issuer can redeem or defease the nonqualifying bonds. Second, the issuer is permitted to use the amounts
received on the disposition of a facility for a use that would qualify for tax-exempt financing as qualified 501(c)(3)
bonds. Similarly, in certain circumstances, if the transferred facility would itself continue to be eligible for
tax-exempt bond financing, that use is treated as a qualifying remedial actions. For this purpose, in applying section
55 through 59, 141 through 147, 149, and 150, the bonds are treated as reissued on the date of the deliberate action.
Treasury and the Service are considering alternative ways in which the requirements of section 55 through 59 could
be satisfied for this purpose (for example, a closing agreement with the issuer similar to the one described below).
These rules are based on, but are more flexible than, the safe harbors in Rev. Porc. 93-17. For example, qualifying
alternative uses of the financed facility would include uses under section 142. Finally, the proposed regulations
provide the Commissioner with the authority to provide additional remedial actions by publication in the Internal
Revenue Bulletin.

3. 

Consideration of alternative remedial action

. Defeasing bonds generally results in an issuer foregoing much of the ongoing benefit provided by tax-exempt financing.
In lieu of providing for defeasing as a remedial action, a more direct remedial action is being considered. Treasury
and the Service are considering the issuance of a revenue procedure pursuant to which an issuer may request a closing
agreement with respect to outstanding bonds. Under the closing agreement, the issuer would make a payment to the Service
to prevent the interest on bonds from being includable in gross income of bondholders as a result of a deliberate action
that results in satisfaction of the private activity bond test. Generally, the closing agreement would be conditioned
upon satisfying the requirements of  1.141-13(a) (relating to conditions for remedial action). If this
procedure is adopted, defeasance of bonds would no longer be a permissible remedial action.

The issuer would be required to make the payment within 30 days of the execution of the closing agreement. The amount
of the payment would equal the present value of the interest rate differential (as described below) multiplied by
the amount of nonqualified bonds that will be outstanding for each annual period (or shorter period) subject to the
closing agreement.

The interest rate differential would equal an appropriate factor multiplied by the difference between the applicable
federal rate under section 1274(d) (the applicable taxable rate) and the applicable federal rate under section 1288(b)
(the applicable tax-exempt rate). The factor would reflect that the applicable taxable rate is based on obligations
of the United States. The rates used would be those in effect on the date the deliberate action occurs. Each rate (that
is, the short-term, mid-term, or long-term rate) would be based on the remaining weighted average maturity of the
nonqualified bonds.

<TEXT>
 

The amount of the payment would be increased by 20 percent in cases where (1) the bond may be redeemed in accordance with
its terms or (2) the establishment of a defeasance escrow would not satisfy the requirements of  1.141-13(b)(4)
(relating to defeasance of nonqualified bonds) as proposed.
Nonqualified bonds would have the same meaning as in  1.141-13(g)(1), except that in the case of a transfer
for cash as defined in  1.141-13(b)(1), the determination of the nonqualified bonds would be based on
an amount equal to the disposition proceeds. Nonqualified bonds that continue to be treated as tax-exempt because
of a permissible remedial action under  1.141-13 (b), (c), or (d) (for example, because of a permissible
redemption) would not be treated as nonqualified bonds for purposes of the closing agreement.
To enter into the agreement, the issuer also would have to agree to (1) redeem the nonqualified bonds on the earliest
date on which the bonds may be redeemed under their terms, (2) not make any payment under the closing agreement from
bond proceeds as described in section 103(a) of the Code, and (3) comply with  1.141-14 with respect to
any refunding of the nonqualified bonds. In limited situations where it is foreseeable that the issuer, using its
best efforts, will be unable to redeem the bonds at the earliest date, the Commissioner may permit the bonds to remain
outstanding until a later date.
Finally, for cases in which the conditions of  1.141-13(a) are not satisfied, the amount required to be
paid under the closing agreement would be based on the highest marginal individual income tax rate at the time of the
deliberate action and the interest paid or accrued on the nonqualified bonds from the issue date. If the noncompliance
occurred or was expected to occur as of the issue date, the nonqualified bonds would include all the bonds of the issue.


M. Section 1.141-14 Refunding Issues


1. 

General rules. 

The industrial development bond regulations provide only limited guidance on the application of the private activity
bond limitations to refunding issues. The proposed regulations provide guidance regarding the application of the
private activity bond test to refunding issues, including guidance regarding whether an issue to refund a qualified
bond is a qualified bond.
2. 

Private activity bond status

. The proposed regulations generally provide that refunding issues are retested to determine if those bonds are private
activity bonds. These tests are applied based on the use of the proceeds of the refunded issue.
3. 

Qualified bond status

. The proposed regulations also generally provide that refunding issues are retested to determine if those bonds
are qualified bonds. These tests are applied based on the use of the proceeds of the refunded issue.


N. Section 1.141-15 Anti-abuse Rules


The proposed regulations contain an anti-abuse rule to ensure that the regulations are applied consistently with
the purposes of section 141. In the case of a transaction entered into for a principal purpose of transferring to a nongovernmental
person significant benefits of tax-exempt financing in a manner that is inconsistent with the purposes of section
141, the Commissioner may take any action to reflect the substance of the transaction. The proposed regulations provide
several examples illustrating the application of the anti-abuse rule.


O. Section 1.145-1 Qualified 501(c)(3) Bonds


The proposed regulations provide certain limited guidance for purposes of applying the provisions of section 145,
relating to qualified private 501(c)(3) bonds. Thus, generally, as under section 141, compliance with section 145
is determined based on the issuer's reasonable expectations as of the issue date, although deliberate actions may
cause the bonds to fail to be qualified bonds. The proposed regulations also provide that the remedial actions under
proposed  1.141-13 apply for this purpose.


P. Section 1.148-6 Arbitrage Allocation and Accounting Rules


The proposed regulations provide additional guidance regarding when expenditures of proceeds must be allocated
and accounted for under the arbitrage regulations. The proposed regulations provide that if an issuer fails to account
for the expenditure of bond proceeds, the proceeds of the issue are accounted for under a specific tracing method.
An issuer would be required to account for the allocation of proceeds to expenditures not later than 18 months after
the later of the payment of the expenditure and the date the project financed by the issue is placed in service. In no
event may the allocation occur after the first arbitrage rebate installment payment would be due for the issue.

Q. Section 1.150-1 General Definitions for Purposes of All Tax-Exempt Bond Rules



The proposed regulations revise the existing definition of issue that applies for all purposes of sections 103 and
141 through 150 to clarify the circumstances under which taxable and tax-exempt bonds are treated as part of a single
issue.



R. Section 1.1394-1 Enterprise Zone Facility Bonds



1. 

In general. 

The proposed regulations provide guidance on certain aspects of the provisions of section 1394, relating to enterprise
zone facility bonds.

2. 

Limit on amount of bonds. 

Guidance is provided on the application of section 1394(c), which contains a $3 million and a $20 million limitation
on the amount of outstanding tax-exempt enterprise zone facility bonds. These limitations are applied on the basis
of the issue price of an issue. The proposed regulations also provide that in applying these limitations, the lender
in a loans-to-lenders program may be disregarded.

3. 

Good faith compliance. 

Under the proposed regulations, an issue is treated as satisfying certain of the requirements of section 1394 if the
issuer and each principal user in good faith attempt to meet those requirements throughout the term of the issue, and
any failure to comply with these requirements is corrected within a reasonable period after the failure is first discovered.
The proposed regulations provide guidance on the application of this good faith standard. Generally, correction
of noncompliance within one year of discovery is reasonable if the issuer and principal user are using their best efforts
to correct the noncompliance.

4. 

Other rules. 

The proposed regulations also provide guidance on the definition of qualified zone property, including the original
use requirement. Finally, the proposed regulations provide special rules for purposes of applying the maturity
limitation of section 147 to these bonds.



Effective Dates



The regulations are proposed to apply to bonds issued on or after the date 60 days after the adoption of final regulations.
The regulations do not apply to bonds issued on or after the effective date to refund a bond that was not subject to these
private activity bond regulations unless the refunding issue extends the weighted average maturity of the financing.
Under various transition rules, issuers may apply certain of the proposed rules on earlier dates. Before the adoption
of the regulations, the Service will continue to consider requests for rulings in the case of changes of use in which
the safe harbors provided in Rev. Proc. 93-17 are not satisfied.



Special Analyses



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.



Comments and Public Hearing



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
that are submitted timely (preferably a signed original and eight copies) to the IRS. All comments will be available
for public inspection and copying.

A public hearing has been scheduled for Thursday, June 8, 1995, at 10 a.m. in the Auditorium, Internal Revenue Building,
1111 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond
the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts.

The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing.

Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments by May 1, 1995 and submit an outline
of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic by May 18, 1995.

A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments.

An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed.
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing.
Comment is solicited on all aspects of the proposed regulations. In addition, comment is specifically solicited
on the following topics:
(1) the desirability of adopting the closing agreement procedure for noncompliance in lieu of providing for defeasance,
other situations in which the closing agreement procedure, if adopted, should apply, and whether other procedures
should be available to issuers;
(2) the condition that, in order to take certain remedial actions, certain bonds must contain early redemption provisions;
(3) additional limitations on the application of the disposition proceeds rules to reduce administrative burdens
on issuers and whether the disposition proceeds rules should apply for purposes of section 148;
(4) problems resulting from rules binding an issuer to the form of its transaction (see, for example, 

New York City

 v. 

Commissioner,

 103 T.C. No. 27 (1994));
(5) the application of the private security or payment test to variable yield issues;
(6) other circumstances in which issuers should be permitted to finance the government use portion of a mixed use facility;
(7) the required consistency between arbitrage and private activity bond allocations of proceeds;
(8) the treatment of requirements contracts as output contracts; and
(9) safe harbors for provisions of the regulations requiring determinations of reasonableness or fair market value.

 1.141-1 

Definitions and rules of general application.



(a) 

In general.

 For purposes of   1.141-1 through 1.141-16, the definitions and rules in this section, the
definitions in  1.150-1, and the following definitions under  1.148-1 apply: bond year,
commingled fund, higher yielding investment, investment proceeds, investments, investment-type property, issue
price, nonpurpose investment, qualified guarantee, qualified hedge, reasonable expectations, reasonably required
reserve or replacement fund, rebate amount, replacement proceeds, reserve or replacement fund, sale proceeds,
and yield.

(b) 

Definitions.

Common areas

 means portions of a facility that are equally available to all users of a facility on the same basis for uses that are
incidental to the primary use of the facility. For example, hallways and elevators generally are treated as common
areas if they are used by the different lessees of a facility in connection with the primary use of that facility.



Consistently applied

 means applied uniformly to account for proceeds and other amounts.



Essential governmental function

 is defined in  1.141-5(c)(4).



Financed

 means constructed, reconstructed, or acquired with proceeds of an issue.



Governmental bond

 means a bond issued as part of an issue no portion of which consists of private activity bonds.



Governmental person

 means a State or local governmental unit as defined in  1.103-1 or any instrumentality thereof or any entity
issuing obligations on behalf thereof. It does not include the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof.



Hazardous waste remediation bonds

 is defined in  1.141-4(f).



Mixed use facility

 is defined in  1.141-6.



Nongovernmental person

 means a person other than a governmental person.



Nonqualified amount

 means the lesser of_

(1) The sale proceeds of an issue used for any private business use under  1.141-3, or

(2) The sum of the sale proceeds of the issue for which there are payments taken into account as private payments under
 1.141-4(c) and the sale proceeds of the issue secured by an interest in property or payments in respect
of property taken into account as private security under  1.141-4(d).



Output facility,

 except as otherwise provided in   1.141-7a), includes electric and gas generation, transmission,
and related facilities, but not (1) sewage or solid waste disposal facilities, or (2) water collection, storage,
or distribution facilities.



Private business tests

 means the private business use test and the private security or payment test of section 141(b).



Proceeds

 means the sale proceeds, disposition proceeds, and any replaced amounts. Proceeds also include any investment proceeds
from investments that accrue during the project period (net of rebate amounts attributable to the project period).
Proceeds of an issue do not include sale proceeds (other than those deposited in a reasonably required reserve or replacement
fund) used to retire bonds of the issue.



Project period

 means the period beginning on the issue date and ending on the date that the construction, reconstruction, or acquisition
of the project financed is substantially complete. In the case of a multipurpose issue, the issuer may elect to treat
the project period for the entire issue as ending on either the expiration of the temporary period described in  1.148-2(e)(2)
or the end of the fifth bond year after the issue date.



Replaced amounts

 means replacement proceeds that are or are reasonably expected to be available during the project period other than
sinking funds, pledged funds, and other replacement proceeds (as defined in  1.148-1(c) (2) through
(4), respectively).



Term of an issue

 means the period beginning on the issue date and ending on the final maturity date of the issue, except that if the term
of an issue is extended and the primary purpose for that extension is not a governmental purpose, the term of the issue
is determined as if the issue had a final maturity equal to the average maturity date of the issue.



Transfer

 is defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.



Weighted average economic life

 is determined under the rules in section 147(b). The reasonably expected useful life of a facility may be determined
by reference to the class life of the property under section 168.



Weighted average maturity

 is determined under the rules in section 147(b).

(c) 

Disposition proceeds

_(1) 

Definition. Disposition proceeds

 are any amounts (including property) derived from the sale, exchange, or other disposition (

transfer

) of property (other than investments) financed with the proceeds of an issue. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)
of this section, if there are disposition proceeds, any proceeds of the issue allocable to the transferred property
cease to be treated as proceeds of the issue.

(2) 

Amount of disposition proceeds.

 Regardless of the amount received in connection with the transfer, the amount of disposition proceeds is treated
as equal to the proceeds of the issue that had been allocable to the transferred property immediately prior to the transfer.
See  1.141-13(h), 

Example 1.

(3) Exception for general obligation programs.

 Unless the issuer elects otherwise, disposition proceeds do not arise on the transfer of property financed with the
proceeds of a general obligation program if the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) are satisfied. A general obligation
program is an issue of general obligation bonds issued by a general purpose governmental unit that finances more than
75 discrete facilities or projects. The requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) are satisfied if_

(i) The transferred property had an original cost not in excess of the greater of $3,000,000 and 2.5 percent of the issue
price of the issue;

(ii) The transferred property is sold for its fair market value in a transaction other than an installment sale;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941230-1-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) The aggregate amount of the disposition proceeds (determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(3)) of the
issue to which this paragraph (c)(3) applies does not exceed 10 percent of the issue price; and
(iv) The amounts received are deposited in a commingled fund with substantial tax or other revenues from governmental
operations of the transferor and the amounts are reasonably expected to be spent for governmental purposes within
6 months from the date of the commingling.

(4) 

Below market transfers and authority of Commissioner. 

The Commissioner may treat the proceeds as allocable to either the transferred property or the disposition proceeds,
whichever allocation produces the greater amount of private business use and private security or payments, if_
(i) The financed property is transferred for less than its fair market value;
(ii) The weighted average maturity of the issue to which the disposition proceeds are allocable exceeds 120 percent
of the reasonably expected weighted average economic life of the property financed by that issue before the disposition;
(iii) The issuer does not expend the disposition proceeds or deposit those amounts in a defeasance escrow (as defined
in  1.141-13(b)(5)) within 2 years of the transfer; or
(iv) The transfer is designed to avoid the provisions of section 141.
(d) 

Elections. 

Elections must be made in writing on or before the issue date and retained as part of the bond documents, and, once made,
may not be revoked without the permission of the Commissioner.
(e) 

Treatment of partnerships_

(1) 

General rule. 

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), a partnership is treated as a separate entity under the private
business tests and the private loan financing test. Thus, any use of proceeds or other action by a partnership is an
action of a nongovernmental person.
(2) 

Certain partnerships disregarded. 

A partnership is disregarded (that is, treated as an aggregate of its partners) so that the partnership's actions
are treated as the actions of the partners for purposes of the private business tests and private loan financing test
if_
(i) The partnership could validly elect under section 761(a)(2) to be excluded from the application of Subchapter
K of the Code and all allocations to partners are consistent with each partner being allocated the same distributive
share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and basis, and this share remains the same during the entire
period that the person is a partner; or
(ii) Each of the partners is a governmental person and all of the partnership's income is excludable from gross income
under section 115.
(f) 

Related parties. 

Except as otherwise provided, all related parties are treated as one person and any reference to ``person'' includes
any related party.

Private activity bond tests.

(a) 

Overview.

 Interest on a private activity bond is not excludable from gross income under section 103(a) unless the bond is a qualified
bond. The purpose of the private activity bond tests of section 141 is to limit the volume of tax-exempt bonds that finance
the activities of nongovernmental persons, without regard to whether a financing actually transfers benefits of
tax-exempt financing to a nongovernmental person. The private activity bond tests serve to identify arrangements
that have the potential to transfer the benefits of tax-exempt financing, as well as arrangements that actually transfer
these benefits. The regulations under section 141 may not be applied in a manner that is inconsistent with these purposes.

(b) 

Scope.

 Sections 1.141-1 through 1.141-16 apply generally for purposes of the private activity bond limitations
under section 141. In addition, as specifically provided, certain provisions of   1.141-1 through
1.141-16 apply for purposes of other limitations on tax-exempt bonds under sections 142 through 150.

(c) 

General definition of private activity bond.

 Under section 141, bonds are private activity bonds if they meet either (1) the private business use and private payment
or security tests of section 141(b) or (2) the private loan financing test of section 141(c). The private business
use and private security or payment tests are described in   1.141-3 and 1.141-4. The private
loan financing test is described in  1.141-5.

(d) 

Reasonable expectations and deliberate actions

_(1) 

In general.

 An issue is an issue of private activity bonds if the issuer reasonably expects, as of the issue date, that the issue
will meet either (i) the private business tests, or (ii) the private loan financing test. An issue is also an issue of
private activity bonds if the issuer takes a deliberate action, subsequent to the issue date, that causes the conditions
of either the private business tests or the private loan financing test to be met.

(2) 

Deliberate actions defined.

 In general, a deliberate action is any action taken by the issuer that is within its control. An intent to violate the
requirements of section 141 is not necessary for an action to be deliberate. Except as otherwise provided in the next
sentence of this paragraph (d)(2), an action that would be treated as involuntary under section 1033 is not a deliberate
action. Any action is treated as a deliberate action if the financed facility was designed differently, sized larger,
built sooner, or constructed in a more costly manner than is reasonably necessary for the governmental purposes of
the issuer. A deliberate action occurs on the earlier of the date the parties agree on the consideration for the new
use or the date on which the new use occurs.

(3) 

Certain remedial actions.

 See  1.141-13 for certain remedial actions that prevent a deliberate action from causing the related
bonds to cease to be treated as tax-exempt bonds.

(4) 

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the application of this section:






Example 1.

 City B issues bonds to finance the purchase of land. On the issue date, B reasonably expects that it will be the sole user
of the land for the entire term of the bonds. Subsequently, the federal government acquires the land in a condemnation
action. B sets aside the condemnation proceeds to pay debt service on the bonds but does not redeem them on their first
call date. The bonds are not private activity bonds because B has not taken a deliberate action after the issue date.



Example 2.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 1,

 except that B uses all the condemnation proceeds to make a loan to Corporation T, a nongovernmental person. The bonds
are private activity bonds because B has taken a deliberate action after the issue date.

 The private business use test relates to the use of the proceeds of an issue. The 10 percent private business use test
of section 141(b)(1) is met if more than 10 percent of the proceeds of an issue is used in a trade or business carried on
by a nongovernmental person. For this purpose, the use of financed property is treated as the use of proceeds. This
section also applies to the private business use test under sections 141(b)(3) (unrelated or disproportionate use),
141(b)(4) ($15 million limitation for output facilities), and 141(b)(5) (the coordination with the volume cap where
the nonqualified amount exceeds $15 million).

(2) 

Indirect use. 

In determining whether an issue meets the private business use test, indirect as well as direct use of the proceeds
is taken into account. For example, the issuer's use of the proceeds to engage in a series of financing transactions
for property to be used by nongovernmental persons in their trades or businesses may cause the private business use
test to be met. In addition, proceeds are treated as used in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person in situations
involving other arrangements, whether in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions, whereby a nongovernmental
person uses property acquired with the proceeds of an issue in its trade or business.

(3) 

Ultimate and intermediate use. 

In determining whether an issue meets the private business use test, both the ultimate and intermediate uses of proceeds
are taken into account. For example, a facility is treated as being used for a private business use if it is leased to
a governmental person and then subleased to a nongovernmental person or if it is leased to a governmental person and
subleased to a governmental person, provided in each case that the nongovernmental person's use is in a trade or business.

(4) 

Aggregation of private business use. 

The use of proceeds by all nongovernmental persons is aggregated to determine whether the private business use test
is satisfied.

(b) 

General definition of private business use

_(1) 

In general.

 Proceeds are used for a private business use if they are used in a trade or business carried on by a nongovernmental person.
For this purpose, any activity carried on by a person other than a natural person is treated as a trade or business. See
 1.141-1(e) relating to certain partnerships.

(2) 

Use of proceeds. 

As further described in this paragraph (b) and except as otherwise provided in this section, a person uses proceeds,
for purposes of the private business use test, if it (i) owns or leases financed property, (ii) is loaned those proceeds,
or (iii) has actual or beneficial use of financed property under a management or incentive payment contract, output
contract, or other arrangement.

(3) 

Agents and employees. 

Use of proceeds by nongovernmental persons in their capacity as agents or employees of a governmental person is not
use for purposes of the private business use test.

(4) 

Ownership. 

Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, ownership of financed property is treated as use of their property
for purposes of the private business use test.

(5) 

Leases.

 Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) or (f) of this section, the lease of a financed facility is treated as a use of
that facility for purposes of the private business use test. For this purpose, any arrangement, such as a management
contract, that is properly characterized is a lease for federal income tax purposes is treated as a lease.

(6) 

Management contracts.

 A management contract (as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section) results in use of the financed property if_

(i) The contract is not a qualified management contract (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section); or

(ii) The service provider is treated as the lessee of the financed property for federal income tax purposes.

(7) 

Output facilities. 

See  1.141-7 for special rules under which contracts for purchase of output of output facilities result
in use of the financed facility.

(8) 

Discharge of primary legal obligation

_(i) 

General rule.

 In general, a nongovernmental person is treated as a user of a financed facility if the financing of that facility discharges
a primary and unconditional legal obligation of that nongovernmental person, even if the nongovernmental person
has no possession or control of the facility. Further, the use resulting from the discharge of a primary legal obligation
is not use as a member of the general public within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section. A primary legal obligation
does not include a law of general application (for example, an ordinance requiring that all businesses properly dispose
of hazardous waste). An obligation imposed on the owner of a facility is not the primary obligation of any other user
of that facility.

(ii) 

Example. 

The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (b)(8) (see also 

Example 12

 of paragraph (e) of this section):






Example. 

As a condition to obtaining a permit to construct an industrial development, Developer N unconditionally agrees
that it will construct governmentally owned streets and sidewalks in its development. N and several other developers
undertake to create District, a political subdivision. District issues its tax assessment bonds, the proceeds of
which are used, in part, to construct the street and sidewalk improvements that N is obligated to construct. N's obligation
to construct the improvements is unconditional and, therefore, the discharge of that obligation results in private
business use of the proceeds used to construct those improvements.

(9) 

Research agreements. 

As provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an agreement by a nongovernmental person to sponsor research performed
by a governmental person may result in use of the related property for purposes of the private business use test.

(10) 

Other actual or beneficial use. 

For purposes of the private business use test, use includes any other actual or beneficial use of a financed facility
other than use as a member of the general public (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section).

(c) 

Qualified management contracts

_(1) 

In general. 

A management contract is a qualified management contract if it meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3),
and (c)(4) of this section. See also paragraphs (c)(5) and (e) of this section for de minimis exceptions.

(2) 

General compensation requirements. 

The contract must provide for reasonable compensation for services rendered with no compensation based, in whole
or in part, on a share of net profits from the operation of the facility. Reimbursement of the service provider for actual
and direct expenses paid by the service provider to unrelated parties is not by itself treated as compensation.

(i) Compensation based on 

(A) a percentage of gross revenues (or adjusted gross revenues) of a facility or a percentage of expenses from a facility,
but not both,

(B) a capitation fee, or

(C) a per-unit fee is generally not considered to be based on a share of net profits.

(ii) Similarly, a productivity reward equal to a stated dollar amount based on increases or decreases in gross revenues,
reductions in total expenses, but not both, generally does not cause the compensation to be based on a share of net profits.

(3) 

Permissible arrangements. 

The management contract must be described in paragraph (c)(3)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section.

(i) 

100 percent periodic fixed fee arrangements. 

All of the compensation for services during the term of the contract is based on a period fixed fee and the term of the
contract, including all renewal options, does not exceed the lesser of 50 percent of the expected useful life of the
related property and 15 years. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section,
a fee does not fail to qualify as a periodic fixed fee as a result of a single incentive award provision under which compensation
automatically increases when a gross revenue or expense target (but not both) is reached if that award is equal to a
single, stated dollar amount.


(ii) 

80 percent periodic fixed fee arrangements. 

At least 80 percent of the compensation for services for each annual period during the term of the contract is based
on a periodic fixed fee. The term of the contract must not exceed the lesser of 80 percent of the expected useful life
of the related property and 10 years.






(iii) 

50 percent periodic fixed fee arrangements. 

Either at least 50 percent of the compensation for services for each annual period during the terms of the contract
is based on a periodic fixed fee or all of the compensation for services is based on a capitation fee or a combination
of a capitation fee and a periodic fixed fee. The term of the contract must not exceed 5 years, including all renewal
options. The contract must be terminable by the governmental persons upon reasonable notice at the end of the third
year of the contract term, without penalty or cause.


(iv) 

Per-unit fee arrangements in certain 3-year contracts. 

All of the compensation for services is based on a per-unit fee or a combination of a per-unit fee and a periodic fixed
fee. The contract has a term, including renewal options, that is not longer than 3 years. The contract must be terminable,
by the governmental person on reasonable notice, without penalty or cause, at the end of the second year of the contract
term. The amount of the per-unit fee must be specified in the contract or otherwise specifically limited by the government
person or an independent third party, such as the administrator of the Medicare program.


(v) 

Percentage of revenue or expense fee arrangements in certain 2-year contracts. 

All the compensation for services is based on a percentage of fees charged or a combination of a per-unit fee and a percentage
of revenue or expense fee. During the start-up period, however, compensation may be based on a percentage of either
gross revenues, adjusted gross revenues, or expenses of a facility. The contract must have a term, including renewal
options, that is not longer than 2 years. The contract must be terminable by the governmental person on reasonable
notice, without penalty or cause, at the end of the first year of the contract term. This paragraph (c)(3)(v) applies
only to contracts under which the service provider primarily provides services to third parties (for example, radiology
services), or service contracts involving a facility during an initial start-up period for which there have been
insufficient operations to establish a reasonable estimate of the amount of the annual gross revenues and expenses
(for example, a contract for general management services for the first year of operations).




(4) 

No related parties or common control. 

The service provider must not have any role or relationship with the governmental person that, in effect, substantially
limits the governmental person's ability to exercise its rights, including cancellation rights, under the contract.
This requirement is satisfied if_

(i) Not more than 20 percent of the voting power of the governing body of the governmental person in the aggregate is
vested in the service provider and its directors, officers, shareholders, and employees;




(ii) Except in the case of a contract for physician services to patients or similar contracts, not more than 20 percent
of the voting power of the governing body of the service provider in the aggregate is vested in the governmental person
and its directors, officers, shareholders, and employees;


(iii) Overlapping board members do not include the chief executive officers of the service provider or its governing
body or the governmental person or its governing body; and

<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iv) The governmental person and the service provider under the contract are not related parties.

(5) 

De minimis exception for functionally related use. 

The use of a financed facility pursuant to a qualified management contract does not result in use of the financed facility
for purposes of the private business use test if that use is functionally related and subordinate to that management
contract and that use is not, in substance, a separate contractual agreement (for example, a separate lease of a portion
of the financed facility). Thus, for example, exclusive use of storage areas by the manager for equipment that is necessary
for it to perform its required activities does not give rise to private business use.

(6) 

Definitions. 

For purposes of this paragraph (c), the following definitions apply:

(i) 

Adjusted gross revenues 

means gross revenues of all or a portion of a facility, less allowances for bad debts and contractual and similar allowances.

(ii) 

Capitation fee 

means a fixed periodic amount for each person for whom the service provider or the governmental person assumes the
responsibility to provide all needed services for a specified period so long as the quantity and type of services actually
provided to covered persons varies substantially. For example, a capitation fee includes a fixed dollar amount payable
per month to a medical service provider for each member of a health maintenance organization plan for whom the provider
agrees to provide all needed medical services for a specified period. A capitation fee may include a variable component
of up to 20 percent of total compensation designed to protect the service provider against risks such as catastrophic
loss.

(iii) 

Periodic fixed fee 

means a stated dollar amount for services rendered for a specified period of time. For example, a stated dollar amount
per month is a periodic fixed fee. The stated dollar amount may automatically increase according to a specified, objective,
external standard that is not linked to the output or efficiency of a facility. For example, the Consumer Price Index
and similar external indices that track increases in prices in an area or increases in revenues or costs in an industry
are objective external standards. Capitation fees and per-unit fees are not periodic fixed fees.

(iv) 

Per-unit fee 

means a fee based on a unit of service provided. For example, a stated dollar amount for each specified medical procedure
performed, car parked, or passenger mile is a per-unit fee.

(v) 

Renewal option 

means a provision under which the service provider has a legally enforceable right to renew the contract. Thus, for
example, a provision under which a contract is automatically renewed for one-year periods absent cancellation by
either party is not a renewal option (even if it is expected to be renewed).

(vi) 

Management contract 

means a management, service, or incentive payment contract between a governmental person and a service provider
under which the service provider provides services involving all, a portion of, or any function of, a facility. For
example, a management or incentive payment service contract includes a contract for the provision of management
services for an entire hospital, management services for a specific department of a hospital, or an incentive payment
contract for physician services to patients of a hospital. Management contracts do not include a customary contract
for janitorial or similar services. The mere granting of admitting privileges by a hospital to a doctor does not result
in a management contract even if those privileges are conditioned on the provision of de minimis services, if those
privileges are available to all qualified physicians in the area, consistent with the size and nature of its facilities.
A contract to provide for the operation of a mixed use facility described in  1.141-6(b)(2)(i)(B) (relating
to certain undivided ownership interests) is not a management contract if the only compensation is the reimbursement
of actual and direct expenses paid by the service provider.

(vii) 

Service provider 

means any person other than a governmental person that provides services under a contract to or for the benefit of a
governmental person.

(viii) 

Penalties 

for terminating a contract include a limitation on the governmental person's right to compete with the service provider;
a requirement that the governmental person purchase equipment, goods, or services from the service provider; and
a requirement that the governmental person pay liquidated damages for cancellation of the contract. In contrast,
a requirement effective on cancellation that the governmental person reimburse the service provider for ordinary
and necessary expenses or a restriction on the governmental person against hiring key personnel of the service provider
is generally not a contract termination penalty. The existence of another contract between the service provider
and the governmental person, such as a loan or guarantee by the service provider, constitutes a contract termination
penalty if that contract contains terms that are not customary or arm's-length that could operate to prevent the governmental
person from terminating the contract (for example, provisions under which the contract terminates if the service
contract is terminated or that place substantial restrictions on the selection of a substitute service contract
provider).

(d) 

Research agreements)

_(1) 

General rule.

 A research agreement described in either paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section does not result in private business
use.
(2) 

Corporate-sponsored research.

 A research agreement relating to a facility used for basic research supported or sponsored by a nongovernmental person
is described in this paragraph (d)(2) if any license or other use of resulting technology by the sponsor is permitted
only on the same terms as the recipient would permit that use by any unrelated, nonsponsoring party (that is, the sponsor
must pay a competitive price for its use), with the price paid for that use determined at the time the license or other
resulting technology is available for use. Although the recipient need not permit persons other than the sponsor
to use any license or other resulting technology, the price paid by the sponsor must be no less than the price that would
be paid by any non-sponsoring party.
(3) 

Cooperative research agreements.

 A research agreement relating to a facility used pursuant to a joint industry-university cooperative research arrangement
is described in this paragraph (d)(3) if_
(i) Multiple, unrelated sponsors agree to fund university-performed basic research;
(ii) The research to be performed and the manner in which it is to be performed (for example, selection of the personnel
to perform the research) is determined by the university;
(iii) Title to any patent or other product incidentally resulting from the basic research lies exclusively with the
university; and
(iv) Sponsors are entitled to no more than a nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use the product of any of that research.
(4) 

Basic research.

 For purposes of this paragraph (d), 

basic research

 has the same meaning as under section 41(e)(7)(A) (that is, any original investigation for the advancement of scientific
knowledge not having a specific commercial objective, except that this term does not include basic research conducted
outside the United States or basic research in the social sciences, arts, or humanities). Basic research does not
include applied or practical research, product development, or similar activities.
(e) 

Exception for general public use_

(1) 

General public use_

(i) 

In general.

 Private business use does not include use as a member of the general public (

general public use

). Use of a financed facility by nongovernmental persons in their trades or businesses is treated as general public
use only if_
(A) The facility is intended for use by the general public; and
(B) The use by those nongovernmental persons is reasonably expected to be on the same basis as use by other members of
the general public.
(ii) 

Relation to other use.

 Use of a financed facility by the general public does not prevent the proceeds from being used for a private business
use because of other use under this section.
(2) 

Intended for use by the general public.

 (i) 

Number of users.

 A facility is not intended for use by the general public if less than 25 percent of the reasonably expected direct use
of the facility is by persons that individually account for no more than 1 percent of the use of the facility.
(ii) 

Persons constituting the general public.

 Although the general public ordinarily includes natural persons not engaged in trades or businesses, the general
public may consist entirely of a large number of nongovernmental persons engaged in different types of trades or businesses.
The general public cannot consist predominately of a large number of nongovernmental persons engaged in the same
type of trade or business. For example, an electric transmission line used by a large number of electric utilities
is not used by the general public. See, however, 

Example 6

 of paragraph (h) of this section.
(3) 

Use on the same basis_

(i) 

Use related to other facilities_

(A) 

General rule.

 The use of a financed facility by a nongovernmental person is not on the same basis as use by the general public if the
financed facility is functionally and integrally related to another facility that is used by that nongovernmental
person (the 

primary facility

) and significant economic benefits with respect to the primary facility arise from the use of the related facility
that are not available to the general public. If more than 75 percent of the use of the related facility is by the general
public and not use in connection with the primary facility, the benefits to the primary facility are treated as insignificant
for this purpose.

<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(B) 

Functionally and integrally related.

 Generally, a facility is not functionally and integrally related to a primary facility for this purpose if it is not
a necessary component of the primary facility. Examples of facilities that are typically functionally and integrally
related to other facilities in a manner that results in significant economic benefits are parking lots at airports,
stadiums, and shopping centers, and utility and other infrastructure improvements for a new development, stadium,
or airport. On the other hand, a parking lot in a large urban business district where there are many separate businesses
typically does not produce significant benefits to any particular person.

(ii) 

Priority rights or other preferential benefits.

 Use under an arrangement that conveys priority rights or other preferential benefits is not use on the same basis as
the general public. Arrangements for a term of more than one month generally convey preferential benefits. Arrangements
providing for use that is available to the general public at no charge or on the basis of rates that are generally applicable
and uniformly applied do not convey priority rights or other preferential benefits. For this purpose, rates may be
treated as generally applicable and uniformly applied even if_

(A) Different rates apply to different classes of users, such as volume purchasers, if the differences in rates are
customary and reasonable;

(B) Users are permitted to reserve short-term or incidental use in advance;

(C) Existing users, each using less than 1 percent of a financed facility, possess rights of first refusal to renew
their use at generally applicable, fair market value rates that are in effect at the time of renewal; and

(D) A specially negotiated arrangement is entered into, but only if the user is prohibited by federal law from paying
the generally applicable rates, and the terms of the arrangement are as comparable as reasonably possible to the generally
applicable rates.

(4) 

Special rules for system improvements.

 For improvements to existing public utility or infrastructure systems such as roads or sewers, but not discrete structures
such as parking facilities (

system improvements

), whether the use of a system improvement is general public use may be determined by reference to the system as a whole
if the system improvement is insubstantial, based either on aggregate cost or scope relative to the system as a whole
within the jurisdiction of the issuer. Except in the case of improvements to roads, a system improvement is insubstantial
for this purpose if the cost of the system improvement is less than 5 percent of the cost of the system as a whole. In addition,
in determining whether the use of a system improvement by the general public is insubstantial, paragraph (e)(3)(i)
of this section (relating to use related to other facilities) does not apply.

(5) 

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e):






Example 1. Governmentally owned and operated hotel.

 State C issues its bonds to purchase land and construct a hotel for use by the general public (that is, tourists, visitors,
business travelers, etc.). The bond documents provide that C will own and operate the project for the period required
to redeem the bonds. Use of the hotel by hotel guests who are travelling in connection with trades or businesses of nongovernmental
persons is not a private business use of the hotel by these persons because it is general public use.



Example 2. Toll road.

 State D issues its bonds to finance the construction of a toll road and the cost of erecting related facilities such
as gasoline service stations and restaurants. These related facilities represent less than 10 percent of the total
cost of the project and are to be leased or sold to nongovernmental persons. The road is to be owned and operated by D.
The bonds do not satisfy the private business use test since less than 10 percent of the proceeds is to be used, directly
or indirectly, in the trades or businesses of nongovernmental persons. The fact that vehicles owned by nongovernmental
persons engaged in their trades or businesses may use the road in common with, or as a part of, the general public, is
not material.



Example 3. Contract with United States.

 G, a sewage collection and treatment district, operates facilities that were financed with its bonds. F, an agency
of the United States, has a base located within G. Approximately 20 percent of G's facilities are used to treat sewage
produced by F under a contract under which G uses its best efforts to charge F as closely as possible the same amount for
its use of G's services as its other customers pay for the same amount of services, although those other customers pay
for services based on standard district charges and tax levies. The use of G's facilities by F is general public use.

Example 4. Parking garage. 

Authority P uses all the proceeds of its bond issue to construct a parking garage containing more than 100 spaces located
in the central business district of a large urban area. At least 90 percent of the spaces in the garage will be available
to the general public on an hourly, daily, or monthly first-come, first-served basis and the Authority reasonably
expects that at least 25 of the spaces will be leased by unrelated individuals. Individual lessees of monthly parking
spaces may renew their spaces at then current fair market value rates. The bonds do not satisfy the private business
use test because at least 90 percent of the use of the parking garage is general public use.



Example 5. Road improvements for stadium. 

H, a political subdivision, issues its bonds to finance construction of a new exit and entrance ramp from an existing
highway onto an adjacent street that will front a newly constructed stadium. The existing highway and street are part
of systems that are used on the same basis by members of the general public. The stadium is owned by nongovernmental
persons. Although the improvements to the highway and the local street are available to the general public and not
limited to persons going to the stadium, more than 75 percent of the use of the ramp will be used in connection with the
stadium (that is, employees, spectators, and other users of the stadium). Thus, these improvements are functionally
and integrally related to the stadium. Under these facts, however, the ramp qualifies as an insubstantial system
improvement and, therefore, the proceeds of H's bonds are not used for a private business use.



Example 6. Airport runway. 

Airport Authority I, a political subdivision, issues its bonds and uses all of the proceeds to finance construction
of a runway at a new city-owned airport. The runway will be available for take-off and landing by any operator of an aircraft
desiring to use the airport. It is reasonably expected that more than 25 percent of the use of the runway (that is, direct
use of the runway) will be by private air carriers (both charter airlines and commercial airlines) in connection with
their use of the airport terminals leased by those carriers. Use of the runways by the private carriers is not on the
same basis as the general public because their lease of property that is functionally and integrally related to the
runways (the terminals) results in significant economic benefits from runway use that are not available to other
users. The use by these private air carriers is not general public use, and the proceeds of I's bonds are used for a private
business use.



Example 7. Airport parking lot. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 6, 

except that several months after the issuance of the bonds to finance the construction of the runway, I issues bonds
all of the proceeds of which are used to construct a parking lot at the airport. The parking lot will be used entirely
by employees of the airport, employees of the airlines and other businesses that are private business users of the
airport terminal, and persons traveling by airplane that depart from the airport. The use of the parking lot by the
airlines and other private business users of the airport terminal is not treated as general public use for the same
reasons as in 

Example 6.

Example 8. Federal use of prisons. 

Authority P uses all of the proceeds of its bonds to construct a prison. P contracts with a federal agency F to house federal
prisoners on a space-available, first-come, first-served basis, pursuant to which the federal agency will be charged
approximately the same amount for each prisoner as other governmental persons that enter into similar transfer agreements.
It is reasonably expected that other governmental units will enter into similar agreements. P may terminate the contract
on 90 days notice. it is reasonably expected that during the term of the contract, federal prisoners will constitute
more than 10 percent of the prisoners at the prison. The bonds satisfy the private business use test because F and any
governmental persons using the prison under similar agreements are not members of the general public.



Example 9. Business insurance fund. 

Authority deposits all of the proceeds of its bonds in its hazardous business insurance fund and invests all of those
proceeds in tax-exempt bonds. The hazardous business insurance fund provides liability insurance to more than 100
operators of different types of hazardous businesses within the meaning of State law. Each of the insured persons
is required under State law to obtain this type of insurance as a condition to their trade or business operations. Each
participant receives insurance for a term of one year, and it is expected that the fund will be available for renewals.
The participants are not treated as members of the general public because the term of the insurance conveys preferential
benefits.



Example 10. Port road. 

Highway Authority W uses all $200 million of the proceeds of its bonds to construct a 25-mile road to connect an industrial
port owned by Corporation C with existing roads owned and operated by W that are all located within City T. Other than
the port, the nearest residential or commercial development to the new road is 12 miles away. Although there may be
additional development in the area surrounding the new road, there is no reasonable expectation that the development
will occur within the 3-year period following the issuance of the bonds. W does not reasonably expect that more than
25 percent of the use of the new road will be by persons other than employees and other persons doing business with C.
The bonds satisfy the private business use test because the road, although available for use by the general public,
will have insubstantial general public use and will not qualify as an insubstantial system improvement because the
cost of the project is not insubstantial.

Example 11. Connecting road.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 10

, except that the road extends beyond the port to a new residential development. Persons residing in this development
will account for more than 25 percent of the use of both segments of the road. The bonds do not satisfy the private business
use test because the use of the road is general public use.



Example 12. Fish ladder.

 J, a political subdivision, owns and operates a hydro-electric generation plant and related facilities. Pursuant
to a take or pay contract having a term equal to the useful life of the facility, J sells 15 percent of the output of the
plant to Corporation K, an investor-owned utility. Under the license issued to J for operation of the plant, J is required
by federal regulations to construct various facilities for the preservation of fish and for public recreation. J
issues its obligations to finance the fish preservation and public recreation facilities. The financed facilities
provide no direct benefits to J or the purchasers of the electricity produced by the plant. Because K has no primary
legal or contractual obligation to provide the financed facilities, the facilities are not used for a private business
use by K under paragraph (b)(8) of this section. Under this paragraph (e), however, the fish preservation facilities,
but not the public recreation facilities, are treated as used by K because they are functionally and integrally related
to the generation plant.




(f) 

De minimis exceptions

_(1) 

Short-term leases and similar arrangements.

 Use by a nongovernmental person pursuant to a lease, management contract, or similar arrangement does not result
in private business use if_

(i) The agreement may not be renewed or extended beyond the period described in this paragraph (f)(1);

(ii) Following the expiration of that agreement the facility subject to the agreement is not used for a private business
use (determined without regard to this paragraph (f)(1));

(iii) The term (or in the case of an agreement entered into prior to, and not in connection with, the issuance of the bonds,
the remaining term) of the agreement does not exceed the least of (A) 1 year, (B) 10 percent of the remaining economic
life of the financed facility (determined at the time the arrangement is entered into), and (C) 10 percent of the remaining
term of the bonds; and

(iv) Except in the case of a lease, management contract, or similar agreement entered into prior to the issue date (or
contemplated issuance) of bonds financing the acquisition of the property, the agreement must be an arm's-length,
fair market value agreement.

(2) 

Temporary use by developers.

 Use by a developer of an improvement that carries out an essential governmental function during an initial development
period does not result in private business use if_

(i) The issuer and the developer reasonably expect on the issue date to proceed with all reasonable speed to develop
and sell the related property to members of the general public and covenant in the bond documents to do so with due diligence;

(ii) The issuer and the developer reasonably expect on the issue date that the related property will be sold to members
of the general public within 3 years of the issue date; and

(iii) Bonds of the issue are not required to be retired in connection with the developer's sale of property to members
of the general public.

(3) 

Incidental use

_(i) 

General rule.

 Incidental use of a financed facility is disregarded to the extent that that use doe not exceed 2.5 percent of the proceeds
of the entire issue. A use of a facility by a person is incidental if_

(A) The use does not involve the transfer to the person of possession and control over space that is separated from other
areas of the facility by walls, partitions, or other physical barriers, such as a night gate affixed to a structural
component of a building (a 

nonpossessory use

);

(B) The nonpossessory use is not functionally related to any other use of the facility by the same person (other than
a different nonpossessory use); and

(C) All nonpossessory uses of the facility do not, in the aggregate, involve the use of more than 2.5 percent of the facility.

(ii) 

Illustrations. 

Incidental uses may include pay telephones, vending machines, advertising, use for television cameras, etc., but
not output purchases.

(4) 

Qualified improvements. 

Proceeds that provide a governmentally owned improvement to a governmentally owned building (including its structural
components and land functionally related and subordinate to the building) are not used for a private business use
if:

(i) The building was placed in service more than one year before the construction or acquisition of the improvement
is begun;

(ii) The improvement is not an enlargement of the building or an improvement of interior space occupied exclusively
for any private business use;

(iii) No portion of the improved building or any payments in respect of the improved building are taken into account
under section 141(b)(2)(A) (the private security test);

(iv) No more than 15 percent of the improved building is used for a private business use; and

(v) The improvement (and any related improvements) does not increase the fair market value of the building by more
than 5 percent. This requirement is treated as satisfied if the improvement is to common areas (such as the roof, heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning system, or elevators), and the improvement is not made as part of a substantial
rehabilitation of the building.

(g) 

Special rule for tax assessment bonds. 

In the case of a tax assessment bond that satisfies the requirements of  1.142-5(c), the loan (or deemed
loan) of the proceeds to the borrower paying the assessment is disregarded in determining whether the private business
use test is satisfied. Thus, the private business use of those proceeds is determined on the basis of the use of the property
improved with the tax assessment loan and any other use of the proceeds used for that assessment.

(h) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section:






Example 1. Long-term lease with nongovernmental person. 

State A and Corporation X enter into an arrangement under which A is to provide a factory that X will lease for 20 years.
The arrangement provides that A will issue $10 million of bonds, the proceeds of the bond issue will be used to purchase
land and to construct and equip a factory in accordance with X's specifications, X will rent the facility (land, factory,
and equipment) for 20 years at an annual rental equal to the amount necessary to amortize the principal of and pay the
interest on the outstanding bonds, and the payments by X and the facility itself will be the security for the bonds.
The bonds are private activity bonds under section 141(b)(1) and (2) since they are part of an issue (1) all of the proceeds
of which are to be used (by purchasing land and constructing and equipping the factory) in a trade or business by a nongovernmental
person, and (2) the payment of the principal of and interest on which is secured by the facility and payments to be made
with respect to the facility. See  1.141-5 (relating to the private loan financing test) and  1.141-4
(relating to the private security or payment test).

Example 2. Sale to nongovernmental person.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 1

 except that X will purchase the facility, and annual payments equal to the amount necessary to amortize the principal
of and pay the interest on the outstanding bonds will be made by X. The bonds are private activity bonds under section
141(b) (1) and (2) for the reasons set forth in 

Example 1

. See  1.141-5 (relating to the private loan financing test) and  1.141-4 (relating to the
private security or payment test).



Example 3. Private payments not based on debt service.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 1

 except that the annual payments required to be made by Corporation X are equal to the fair rental value of the facility
and exceed the amount necessary to amortize the principal of and pay the interest on the outstanding bonds. The bonds
are private activity bonds for the reasons set forth in 

Example 1.

 The requirement that Corporation X pay an amount equal to fair market value, which is in excess of the amount necessary
to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds, does not affect the status of the bonds as private activity bonds.
Similarly, if the present value of the annual payments required to be made by X exceeded 10 percent of the present value
of the debt service on the outstanding bonds, the bonds would be private activity bonds under section 141(b) (1) and
(2) for the reasons set forth in 

Example 1

. See  1.141-2(a) and  1.141-4.



Example 4. Private lease of portion of building.

 (i) State D and Corporation Y enter into an agreement under which Y will lease for 20 years one floor of a 10-story office
building to be constructed by D on land that it will acquire. D will occupy the street level floor and the remaining eight
floors of the building. The portion of the costs of acquiring the land and constructing the building that are allocated
to the space to be leased by Y is not in excess of 10 percent of the total costs of acquiring the land and constructing the
building. These costs, whether attributable to the acquisition of land or the construction of the building, were
allocated to leased space in the same proportion that the reasonable rental value of that leased space bears to the
reasonable rental value of the entire building. From the facts and circumstances presented, it is determined that
that allocation was reasonable. D issues $10 million of bonds, the proceeds of which will be used to purchase land and
construct the office building. The arrangement does not, by itself, cause the private business use test to be met because
not more than 10 percent of the proceeds is to be used, directly or indirectly, in the trade or business of a nongovernmental
person. See  1.141.6.

(ii) If Corporation Y instead leases 2 floors, and the costs allocated to these floors are in excess of 10 percent of
D's investment in the land and building, the arrangement causes the private business use test to be met because more
than 10 percent of the building is to be used in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person.

Example 5. Numerous private leases. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 4

 except that, instead of leasing any space to Corporation Y, State D leases the two floors to numerous unrelated private
businesses to be used in their trades or businesses. No lease will have a term in excess of 2 years. The bonds meet the
private business use test for the reasons set forth in 

Example 4.


Example 6. Municipal auditorium. 

City G issues its obligations to finance the construction of a municipal auditorium that it will own and operate. The
use of the auditorium will be open to anyone who wishes to use it for a short period of time on a rate-scale basis. The rights
of such a user are only those of a transient occupant, rather than the full legal possessory interest of a lessee. It
is anticipated that the auditorium will be used by schools, church groups, fraternities, and numerous commercial
organizations. The revenues from the rentals of the auditorium and the auditorium itself will be the security for
the bonds. The bonds are not private activity bonds because none of the uses constitute use in the trade or business
of a nongovernmental person.




Example 7. Long-term lease of municipal auditorium.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 6

 except that one nongovernmental person engaged in a trade or business will have a 10-year rental agreement providing
for exclusive use of the entire auditorium for 6 weeks of each year at a rental comparable to that charged short-term
users. The bonds satisfy the private business use test since use of the auditorium for 6 weeks each year is more than
10 percent of the use of the auditorium and the agreement is not disregarded as a de minimis use under paragraph (f) of
this section. Thus, more than 10 percent of the proceeds of the issue will be used in a trade or business of a nongovernmental
person. See also paragraph (i) of this section.




Example 8. Management contract in substance a lease. 

City L issues bonds to finance the construction of a city hospital. L enters into a 5-year contract with M, a nongovernmental
person that operates a health maintenance organization relating to the treatment of M's members at L's hospital.
The contract meets the conditions for qualified management contracts under paragraph (c) of this section. However,
the contract also provides that L will guarantee M that 20 percent of the capacity of the hospital will be exclusively
available to members of M's health maintenance organizations at special rates so that the contract is properly characterized
as a lease for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, the issue meets the private business use test.







(i) 

Measurement of private business use

_(1) 

General rule. 

The private business use of proceeds allocated to a facility under  1.141-6 is determined according to
the use of that financed facility during each one-year period beginning from the later of the issue date or the date
the facility is placed in service. The private business use of a facility is equal to the greatest percentage of private
business use for any one year period. The private business use of a facility for any one year period is equal to the average
private business use during that year.


(2) 

Determining average of use. 

The average of the private business use of a facility is determined by comparing the amount of private business use
of that facility during a year to the total amount of private business use and government use during that year. In determining
the total amount of use, periods during which the facility is not in use are disregarded. In determining the average
amount of private business use, the following rules apply:


(i) 

Uses at different times. 

For a facility in which the government use and private business use occur at different times (for example, on different
days), the average amount of private business use is based on the amount of time that the facility is used for private
business use as a percentage of total time for all use. If, however, the use of a facility during different times has
significantly different value, this determination must take into account those different values.


(ii) 

Simultaneous use.

 For a facility in which government use and private business use occur simultaneously, the entire facility is treated
as having private business use. If, however, the private business use and government use is on the same basis, the average
amount of private business use may be determined on a reasonable basis (for example, relative value of use, relative
amount of time used). For example, a governmentally owned facility that is leased or managed by a nongovernmental
person in a manner that results in private business use is treated as entirely used for a private business use. On the
other hand, a garage with unassigned spaces that is used for government use and private business use is only partially
used for a private business use.


(iii) 

Combined use. 

If a facility has private business use that is described in both paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (1)(2)(ii) of this section,
the amount of private business use is determined according to whichever method produces the greatest amount of private
business use. See, however,  1.141-6 for special rules for common areas of a discrete portion of a mixed use facility.


(3) 

Use of a portion of a facility

_(i) 

Discrete portion. 

For purposes of this paragraph (i), measurement of the use of proceeds allocated to a discrete portion of a mixed use
facility is determined by treating the discrete portion as a separate facility.


(ii) 

Common areas. 

The amount of private business use of common areas within a mixed use facility is based on the average amount of private
business use of the remainder of the entire facility.


(4) 

Allocation of neutral costs. 

Proceeds that are used to pay costs of issuance, invested in a reserve or replacement fund, or paid as fees for a qualified
guarantee or a qualified hedge must be allocated ratably among the other purposes for which the proceeds are used.

<TEXT>
 

(5) 

Commencement of private business use. 

Generally, private business use commences on the first date on which there is actual use by the nongovernmental person.
If, however, the issuer and a nongovernmental person enter into an arrangement to transfer a financed facility, private
business use commences on the date of that arrangement if that arrangement was entered into substantially in advance
of the transfer and the transfer will occur during the final year of the term of the issue or after the retirement of the
issue.

(6) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (i):






Example 1. Research facility. 

University U is a state owned and operated university. As part of its activities, U owns and operates a bond-financed
research facility. U enters into sponsored research agreements with nongovernmental persons that result in private
business use. The research otherwise conducted by U (government use) and the private research will take place simultaneously
in all laboratories within the research facility. All laboratory equipment will be available continuously for use
by workers who will perform both types of research. A researcher will often use a single laboratory to perform identical
research that may meet the objectives of U's research and the obligations under the research contracts. Under this
section, the nongovernmental persons are using the facility for a private business use. The private business use
results from a use of the facility, the research, that is on the same basis as government use of the facility. Therefore,
the portion of the facility that is used for a private business use may be determined on a reasonable basis. If more than
10 percent of the use of the facility is private business use, no portion of the facility can be financed with tax-exempt
bonds.



Example 2. Stadium. 

City L issues its obligations and uses all of the proceeds to construct a stadium. L enters into a long-term contract
with a professional sports team T under which T will use the stadium 20 times during each year. These uses will occur
on weeknights and weekends. L reasonably expects that the stadium will be used more than 180 other times each year,
none of which will give rise to private business use. This expectation is based on a feasibility study and historical
use of the old stadium that is being replaced by the new stadium. There is no significant difference in the value of T's
uses when compared to the other uses of the stadium. Assuming no other private business use, the obligations do not
satisfy the private business use test of section 141(b)(1) on the issue date since not more than 10 percent of the use
of the facility is for a private business use.



Example 3. Stadium with significant private business use. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 2, 

except that L reasonably expects that more than 10 percent of the use of the stadium will be for a private business use.
The obligations satisfy the private business use test. Further, since the stadium is not a mixed use facility under
 1.141-6, any obligations issued to finance any portion of the stadium are treated as having private business
use in excess of 10 percent. Therefore, no portion of the stadium can be financed with tax-exempt bonds.



 1.141-4 

Private security or payment test.



(a) 

General rule. 

(1) 

Private security or payment. 

The private security or payment test relates to the nature of the security for, and the source of, the payment of debt
service on an issue. The private payment portion of the test takes into account the payment of the debt service on the
issue that is directly or indirectly to be derived from payments (whether to the issuer or any related party) in respect
of property, or borrowed money, used or to be used for a private business use. The private security portion of the test
takes into account the payment of the debt service of the issue that is directly or indirectly secured by any interest
in (i) property used or to be used for a private business use, or (ii) payments in respect of property used or to be used
for a private business use.

(2) 

Aggregation of private payments and security. 

For purposes of the private security or payment test, payments taken into account as private payments and payments
or property taken into account as private security are aggregated. However, the same payments are not taken into account
as both private security and private payments. For example, the 10 percent private security or payment test is met
if, in the aggregate, the payments taken into account as private payments and the property or payments taken into account
as private security exceed 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds, provided no payment is taken into account under
both portions of the test.

(b) 

Measurement of private payments and security_

(1) 

Scope. 

This paragraph (b) contains rules that apply to both private security and private payment.

(2) 

General rule. 

The security for, and payment of debt service on an issue is determined from the terms of the bond documents and on the
basis of any underlying arrangement. An underlying arrangement may result from separate agreements between the
parties or may be determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of the bonds.
If the payment of debt service on an issue is secured by both a pledge of the full faith and credit of a State or local governmental
unit and any interest in property used or to be used in a private business use, the issue satisfies the private security
or payment test. For special rules for output facilities, see  1.141-7.

(3) 

Present value measurement_

(i) 

Use of present value. 

In determining whether an issue meets the private security or payment test, the present value of the payments or property
taken into account is compared to the present value of the debt service to be paid over the term of the issue.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Debt service

_(A) 

Debt service paid from proceeds

. Debt service does not include any amount paid or to be paid from sale proceeds or investment proceeds. For example,
debt service does not include payments of capitalized interest funded with bond proceeds.
(B) 

Adjustments to debt service

. Debt service is adjusted to take into account payments and receipts that adjust the yield on an issue for purposes
of section 148(f). For example, debt service includes fees paid for qualified guarantees under  1.148-4(f)
and is adjusted to take into account payments and receipts on qualified hedges under  1.148-4(h).
(iii) 

Computation of present value

_(A) 

In general

. Present values are determined by using the yield on the issue as the discount rate and by discounting all amounts to
the issue date. For a fixed yield issue, yield is determined on the issue date and is not adjusted to take into account
subsequent events.

(B) 

Variable yield issues

. The yield on a variable yield issue is determined over the term of the issue. To determine the reasonably expected
yield as of any date, the issuer may assume that the future interest rate on a variable yield bond will be the then-current
interest rate on the bonds determined under the formula prescribed in the bond documents. Unless a change in interest
rate results in a new issuance, changes in interest rates do not constitute deliberate actions.



(iv) 

Application to private security

. For purposes of determining the present value of debt service that is secured by property, property is valued at fair
market value as of the first date on which the property secures bonds of the issue.
(c) 

Private payments

_(1) 

In general

. This paragraph (c) contains rules that apply to private payments.
(2) 

Payments taken into account

_(i) 

Payments for use

_(A) 

In general. 

Both direct and indirect payments made by any nongovernmental person that is treated as using proceeds of the issue
are taken into account as private payments to the extent allocable to the proceeds used by that person. Payments for
a use of proceeds include payments (whether or not to the issuer) in respect of property financed (directly or indirectly)
with those proceeds, even if not made by a private business user. Payments are not made in respect of property financed
with proceeds if those payments are directly allocable to other property being directly used by the person making
the payment, but only to the extent that those payments are reasonable compensation for that other use. See 

Example 4

 and 

Example 5

 in paragraph (g) of this section.
(B) 

Payments not to exceed use

. Payments by a person for a use of proceeds are allocable to the payment of the debt service on the proceeds used by that
person (or with respect to property used by that person) to the extent that the present value of those payments does
not exceed the present value of the debt service on those proceeds. Thus, if 7 percent of the proceeds of an issue is used
by a person, payments by that person are taken into account as private payments only to the extent that the present value
of those payments does not exceed the present value of 7 percent of the debt service on the issue.
(C) 

Payments for operating expenses

. Payments by a person for a use of proceeds do not include the portion of any payment that is properly allocable to the
payment of ordinary and necessary expenses (as defined under section 162) directly attributable to the operation
and maintenance of the financed property used by that person. For this purpose, general overhead and administrative
expenses are not directly attributable to those operations and maintenance. For example, if an issuer receives $5,000
rent during the year for use of space in a financed facility and pays $500 during the year for ordinary and necessary
expenses properly allocable to the operation and maintenance of that space, $500 of the $5,000 received would not
be considered a payment for the use of the proceeds allocable to that space (regardless of the manner in which that $500
is actually used).
(ii) 

Refinanced debt service

. (A) Payments of debt service on an issue to be made from proceeds of a refunding issue are taken into account as private
payments in the same proportion that_
(

1

) the present value of the payments taken into account as private payments for the refunding issue, bears to
(

2

) the present value of the debt service to be paid on the refunding issue.
(B) For example, if all the debt service on a note is paid with proceeds of a refunding issue, the note meets the private
security or payment test if (and to the same extent that) the refunding issue meets the private security or payment
test. This paragraph (c)(2)(ii) does not apply to deliberate actions that occur more than 3 years after the retirement
of the prior issue that are not reasonably expected on the issue date of the refunding issue. For purposes of this paragraph
(c)(2)(ii), whether an issue is a refunding issue is determined without regard to  1.150-1(d)(2)(i)
(relating to certain payments of interest).

<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) 

Use

. For purposes of determining the amount of private payments, all related uses of proceeds of an issue by one person
are treated as one use. For example, proceeds used to make a grant and a loan to the same person to be used to construct
a facility are aggregated in determining the portion of the loan repayments taken into account as private payments.

(3) 

Allocation of payments

_(i) 

Allocations among issues

. If a payment is made for a facility financed with two or more issues, that payment must be allocated among those issues
according to the relative amounts of proceeds of each of those issues that are allocated to that property.

(ii) 

Repayments of equity

. A payment from a private business user of property may be allocated first to repay the issuer for any equity investment
of the issuer in that property (that is, amounts invested by the issuer that do not, directly or indirectly, involve
an expenditure of amounts borrowed).

(d) 

Private security

_(1) 

In general

. This paragraph (d) contains rules that relate to private security.

(2) 

Security taken into account

. The property that is the security for, or the source of, the payment of debt service on a bond need not be property financed
with proceeds. For example, unimproved land or investment securities used, directly or indirectly, in a private
business use that secures a bond provides private security.

(3) 

Pledge of unexpended proceeds

. Proceeds qualifying for an initial temporary period under  1.148-2(e) (2) or (3) or on deposit in a reasonably
required reserve or replacement fund (as defined in  1.148-2(f)(2)(i)) are not taken into account under
this paragraph (d) before the date on which those amounts are either expended or loaned by the issuer to an unrelated
party.

(4) 

Secured by any interest in property or payments

. Property used or to be used for a private business use and payments in respect of that property are treated as private
security if any interest in that property or payments secures the payment of debt service on the bonds. For this purpose,
the phrase 

any interest in

 is to be interpreted broadly and includes, for example, any right, claim, title, or legal share in property or payments.
However, in order for an interest in property or payments to be taken into account as private security, that interest
must secure the payment of debt service on the bonds.

(5) 

Payments in respect of property

. The payments taken into account as private security are payments in respect of property used or to be used for a private
business use. Thus, to be taken into account as private security, payments need not be made by the private business
user. Therefore, payments made by members of the general public for use of a facility used for a private business use
may be taken into account as private security (for example, payments by persons using a facility that is the subject
of a management contract that results in private business use). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(5)
and paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the rules in paragraph (c) of this section apply to determine the amount of payments
treated as payments in respect of property used or to be used for a private business use.

(6) 

Allocation of security among issues

. If any property or payments are taken into account as private security for two or more issues that are equally and ratably
secured 

(parity bonds),

 the property or payments securing those issues must be allocated among those issues on a reasonable basis that takes
into account the relative amounts of debt service on each of the issues. For this purpose, any of the ratable allocation
methods specified in  1.148-6(e)(6) (relating to allocations of commingled reserve or sinking funds
for arbitrage purposes) are treated as reasonable. For bonds other than parity bonds, property or payments that are
taken into account as private security (but not as private payments) are fully allocated to each issue secured by the
property or payments.

(e) 

Generally applicable taxes

_(1) 

General rule.

 For purposes of the private security or payment test, generally applicable taxes are not taken into account (that
is, are not payments from a nongovernmental person and are not payments in respect of property used for a private business
use).

(2) 

Definition of generally applicable taxes.

 A generally applicable tax is an enforced contribution exacted pursuant to legislative authority in the exercise
of the taxing power that is imposed and collected for the purpose of raising revenue to be used for governmental purposes.
A generally applicable tax must have a uniform tax rate that is applied to all persons of the same classification in
the appropriate jurisdiction, and a generally applicable manner of determination and collection.

(3) 

Special charges.

 A payment for a special privilege granted or service rendered is not a generally applicable tax. Special assessments
paid by property owners benefiting from financed improvements are not generally applicable taxes. For example,
a tax that is limited to the property or persons benefitted by an improvement is not a generally applicable tax.

(4) 

 Manner of determination and collection

_(i) 

In general.

 A tax does not have a generally applicable manner of determination and collection if one or more taxpayers make any
special agreements relating to payment of those taxes. A special agreement relating to the payment of a tax is taken
into account whether or not it is reasonably expected to result in any payments that would not otherwise have been made.
On the other hand, if an issuer uses proceeds to make a grant to a taxpayer to improve property, agreements that impose
reasonable conditions on the use of the grant do not cause a tax on that property to fail to be a generally applicable
tax. If an agreement by a taxpayer causes a tax to fail to have a generally applicable manner of determination and collection,
the entire tax paid by that taxpayer is treated as a special charge, unless the agreement is limited to a specific portion
of the tax.

(ii) 

Impermissible agreements.

 The following are examples of agreements that cause a tax to fail to have a generally applicable manner of determination
and collection: an agreement to be personally liable, to provide additional credit support such as a third party guarantee,
or to pay unanticipated shortfalls; an agreement regarding the minimum market value of property subject to property
tax; and an agreement not to challenge or seek deferral of the tax.

(iii) 

Permissible agreements.

 The following are examples of agreements that do not cause a tax to fail to have a generally applicable manner of determination
and collection: an agreement to use a grant for specified purposes (whether or not that agreement is secured); a representation
regarding the expected value of the property following the improvement, an agreement to insure the property and,
if damaged, to restore the property; and a right of a grantor to rescind the grant if property taxes are not paid.

(iv) 

Payments in lieu of taxes.

 A tax equivalency payment and any other payment in lieu of a tax is treated as a generally applicable tax if_

(A) The payment is measured by and equal to the amounts imposed by a regular statute for a tax of general application;

(B) The payment is imposed by a specific statute (even if another agreement, such as a lease, is used as the vehicle for
collection); and

(C) The payment is designated for a public purpose rather than for a privilege, service or regulatory function, or
for any other local benefit tending to increase the value of the property with respect to which the payments are made.

(f) 

Certain waste remediation bonds_

(1) 

Scope. 

This paragraph (f) applies to bonds issued to finance hazardous waste clean-up activities on privately owned land
(

hazardous waste remediation bonds

).

(2) 

Persons that are not private users. 

Payments from nongovernmental persons who are not (other than coincidentally) either users of the site being remediated
or persons potentially responsible for disposing of hazardous waste on that site are not taken into account as private
security. This paragraph (f)(2) applies to payments that secure the payment of principal of, or interest on, the bonds
(directly or indirectly) under the terms of the bonds. This paragraph (f)(2) applies only if the payments are made
pursuant to either (i) a generally applicable state or local taxing statute, or (ii) a state or local statute that regulates
or restrains activities on an industry-wide basis of persons who are engaged in generating or handling hazardous
waste, or in refining, producing, or transporting petroleum, provided that those payments do not represent, in substance,
payment for the use of proceeds. For this purpose, a state or local statute that imposes payments that have substantially
the same character as those described in Chapter 38 of the Code are treated as generally applicable taxes. 

(3) 

Persons that are private users. 

If payments from nongovernmental persons who are either users of the site being remediated or persons potentially
responsible for disposing of hazardous waste on that site do not secure the payment of principal of, or interest on,
the bonds (directly or indirectly) under the terms of the bond, the payments are not taken into account as private payments.
This paragraph (f)(3) applies only if at the time the bonds are issued the payments from those nongovernmental persons
are not material to the security for the bonds. For this purpose, payments are not material to the security for the bonds
if_

(i) The payments are not required for the payment of debt service on the bonds;

(ii) The amount and timing of the payments are not structured or designed to reflect the payment of debt service on the
bonds;

(iii) The receipt or the amount of the payment is uncertain (for example, as of the issue date, no final judgment has
been entered into against the nongovernmental person);

(iv) The payments from those nongovernmental persons, when and if received, are used either to redeem bonds of the
issuer or to pay for costs of any hazardous waste remediation project; and 

(v) If a judgment (but not a final judgment) has been entered against a nongovernmental person by the issue date, there
are, as of the issue date, costs of hazardous waste remediation other than those financed with the bonds that may be
financed with the payments.

(g) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the application of this section:






Example 1. Aggregation of payments. 

State B issues bonds with proceeds of $10 million. B uses $9.7 million of the proceeds to construct a 10-story office
building. B uses the remaining $300,000 of proceeds to make a loan to Corporation Y to finance unrelated privately
owned facilities. In addition, X leases 1 floor of the building for a significant period that is less than the term of
the bonds. As a percentage of the present value of the debt service on the bonds, the present value of Y's loan repayments
is 3 percent and the present value of X's lease payments is 8 percent. The bonds satisfy the private security or payment
test because the private payments taken into account are more than 10 percent of the present value of the debt service
on the bonds.



Example 2. Indirect private payments. 

J, a political subdivision of a state, will issue several series of bonds from time to time and will use the proceeds
to rehabilitate urban areas. More than 10 percent of the proceeds of each issue will be used for the rehabilitation
and construction of buildings that will be leased or sold to nongovernmental persons for use in their trades or business.
Nongovernmental persons will make payments for these sales and leases that have an aggregate present value that is
more than the present value of debt service on 10 percent of each issue. There is no limitation either on the number of
issues or the aggregate amount of bonds that may be outstanding. No group of bondholders has any legal claim prior to
any other bondholders or creditors with respect to specific revenues of J, and there is no arrangement whereby revenues
from a particular project are paid into a trust or constructive trust, or sinking fund, or are otherwise segregated
or restricted for the benefit of any group of bondholders. There is, however, an unconditional obligation by J to pay
the principal of and interest on each issue. The bonds meet the private security or payment test because all of the private
payments are counted.



Example 3. Allocations of payments. 

City Z purchases property for $1,250,000 using $1,000,000 of proceeds of its tax increment bonds and $250,000 of other
revenues that are in its redevelopment fund. The bonds are secured only by the incremental property taxes on the property
attributable to the increase in value of the property from the planned redevelopment of the property. Z will reimburse
the redevelopment fund from amounts paid from the resale of the property. After clearing the property, Z sells it to
Developer M for $250,000, an amount not in excess of the fair market value of the land, which Z uses to reimburse the redevelopment
fund. Although M uses the property financed with the proceeds of the bonds, it also directly uses property that was
not financed with those proceeds. The payments by M are properly allocable to the property financed with the amounts
in Z's redevelopment fund. Accordingly, the issue does not meet the private security or payment test because of M's
$250,000 payment. See paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. 



Example 4. Payments in respect of bond financed property. 

In order to further public safety, City Y issues $5,000,000 of its tax assessment bonds the proceeds of which are used
to move existing electric utility lines underground. Although the utility lines are owned by a nongovernmental utility
company, that company is under no obligation to move the lines. The debt service on the bonds will be paid using assessments
levied by City Y on the customers of the utility. Although the utility lines are privately owned and the utility customers
make payments to the utility company for the use of those lines, the assessments are payments in respect of the cost
of relocating the utility line. Thus, the assessment payments are not made in respect of property used for a private
business use. Any direct or indirect payments to Y by the utility are, however, taken into account as private payments.



Example 5. Management contract. 

City P issues general obligation bonds to finance the renovation of a hospital that it owns. The hospital is operated
for P by D, a nongovernmental person, under a management contract that results in private business use under  1.141-3.
P will use the revenues from the hospital (after the required payments to D) to pay the debt service on the bonds. The
bonds satisfy the private security or payment test because the revenues from the hospital are payments in respect
of property used for a private business use.



Example 6. Lease financing. 

(i) County W issues certificates of participation in a lease of a building that W owns and covenants to appropriate
annual payments for the lease. A portion of each payment is specified as interest. More than 10 percent of the building
is used for private business use. None of the proceeds of the obligations are used with respect to the building. W uses
more than 10 percent of the proceeds of the obligations to construct a stadium that is to be used for a private business
use. If W defaults under the lease, the trustee for the holders of the certificates of participation has a limited right
of repossession under which the trustee may not foreclose but may lease the property to a new tenant at fair market value.
The obligations are secured by an interest in property used for a private business use and, therefore, the obligations
satisfy the private security for payment test.

(ii) The facts are the same as in part (i) of this 

Example 6

 except that, under the terms of the lease, in the event of a default by W, the trustee's only rights are to sue W for any
failure to make payments pursuant to the lease. Thus, the trustee has no rights to the building and no limited right
of repossession. The right to receive lease payments is not an interest in the leased property and, therefore, this
right does not provide private security.

Example 7. Limitation of payments to use not determined annually. 

City Q issues bonds with a term of 15 years and uses the proceeds to construct an office building. The debt service on
the bonds is level throughout the 15-year term. O enters into a 5-year lease of 11 percent of the building with Corporation
R under which R will make lease payments equal to 20 percent of the annual debt service on the bonds for each year of the
lease. The present value of R's lease payments is equal to 12 percent of the present value of the debt service over the
entire 15-year term of the bonds. If, however, the lease payments taken into account as private payments were limited
to 11 percent of debt service paid in each year of the lease, the present value of these payments would be only 8 percent
of the debt service on the bonds over the entire term of the bonds. The bonds satisfy the private security or payment
test, because R's lease payments are taken into account as private payments in an amount not to exceed 11 percent of
the debt service on the bonds over the term of the bonds (rather than 11 percent per year).



Example 8. Parity bonds. 

University L, a political subdivision, issued three separate series of revenue bonds during 1989, 1991, and 1993
under the same bond resolution. L used the proceeds to construct facilities exclusively for its own use. Bonds issued
under the resolution are equally and ratably secured and payable solely from the income derived by L from rates, fees,
and charges imposed by L for the use of the facilities. The bonds issued in 1989, 1991, and 1993 are not private activity
bonds. In 1995, L issues another series of bonds under the resolution to finance additional facilities. L enters into
10-year leases for 20 percent of the new facilities with nongovernmental persons who will use the facilities in their
trades or businesses. The present value of the lease payments from the nongovernmental users will equal 15 percent
of the present value of the debt service on the 1995 bonds. L will commingle all of the revenues from all its bond-financed
facilities in its revenue fund. The portion of the lease payments from nongovernmental lessees of the new facilities
allocable to the 1995 bonds under  1.148-6(e)(6) is less than 10 percent of the present value of the debt
service on the 1995 bonds. The 1995 bonds will meet the private security or payment test because the private lease payments
for the new facility are properly allocated to those bonds (that is, because none of the proceeds of the prior issues
were used for the new facilities).





Example 9. Variable yield issues. 

(i) City M issues general obligation bonds with proceeds of $10 million to finance a 5-story office building. The bonds
bear interest at a variable rate that is recomputed monthly according to an index that reflects current market yields.
They yield that the interest index would produce on the issue date is 6 percent. M leases one floor of the office building
to Corporation T, a nongovernmental person, for the term of the bonds. Using the 6 percent yield as the discount rate,
M reasonably expects on the issue date that the present value of lease payments to be made by T will be 8 percent of the
present value of the total debt service on the bonds. After the issue date of the bonds, interest rates decline significantly,
so that the yield on the bonds over their entire term is 4 percent. Using this actual 4 percent yield as the discount rate,
the present value of lease payments made by T is 12 percent of the present value of the actual total debt service on the
bonds. The bonds are not private activity bonds because M reasonably expected on the issue date that the bonds would
not meet the private security or payment test and because M did not take any subsequent deliberate action to meet the
private security or payment test.


(ii) The facts are the same as part (i) of this 

Example 9, 

except that 5 years after the issue date M leases a second floor to Corporation S, a nongovernmental person, under a
long-term lease. On the date this lease is entered into M reasonably expects that the yield on the bonds over their entire
term will be 5.5 percent, based on actual interest rates to date and the then-current rate on the variable yield bonds.
Using this 5.5 percent yield as the discount rate, as a percentage of the present value of the debt service on the bonds,
the present value of lease payments made by T is 9 percent and the present value of the lease payments made by S is 2 percent.
The bonds are private activity bonds because M has taken a subsequent deliberate action that causes the bonds to meet
the private security or payment test.


Example 10. Stadium ticket tax. 

(i) Authority issues its bonds to finance the construction of a stadium. Under a long-term lease, Corporation X, a
professional sports team, will use more than 10 percent of the stadium. Corporation X will not, however, make any payments
for this private business use. The security for the bonds will be a ticket tax imposed on each person purchasing a ticket
for an event at the stadium. The portion of the ticket tax attributable to tickets purchased by persons attending X's
events will, on a present value basis, exceed 10 percent of the present value of Authority's bonds. The bonds satisfy
the private security or payment test. The ticket tax is not a tax of general application and, to the extent that the tax
receipts relate to X's events, the taxes constitute payments in respect of property used for a private business use.

(ii) The facts are the same as in part (i) of this 

Example 10, 

except that the ticket tax is imposed by Authority on tickets purchased for events at a number of large entertainment
facilities within the jurisdiction of Authority (for example, other stadiums, arenas, concert halls, etc.), some
of which were not financed with tax-exempt bonds. The ticket tax is a tax of general application and therefore the revenue
from this tax are not payments in respect of property used for a private business use. Therefore, the bonds do not satisfy
the private security or payment test.

 1.141-5 


Private loan financing test. 



(a) 

In general

_(1) 

General rule

. Bonds of an issue are private activity bonds if more than the lesser of 5 percent of the proceeds or $5 million of the
sale proceeds of the issue is to be used (directly or indirectly) to make or finance loans to persons other than governmental
units. Section 1.141-2(d) applies in determining whether the private loan financing test is met. 

(2) 

Direct and indirect use of proceeds determinative

. In determining whether the proceeds of an issue are used to make or finance loans, indirect, as well as direct, use
of the proceeds is taken into account. Any use of proceeds by a governmental person that results in the expenditure
of those proceeds (rather than the acquisition of investment property), such as a grant, is treated as the ultimate
use of those proceeds. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), investment property has the meaning in  1.148-1,
except that tax-exempt bonds may be treated as investment property. See  1.148-6 for rules to determine
when proceeds are expended. 

(3) 

Measurement of test

. In determining whether the private loan financing test is met, the amount actually loaned to a nongovernmental person
is not discounted to reflect the present value of the loan repayments. 

(b) 

Definition of loan

_(1) 

General federal tax principles apply

. Any transaction that, for federal income tax purposes generally, is characterized as a loan is a loan for purposes
of this section. Thus, the determination of whether a loan is made depends on the substance of a transaction. For example,
a lease or other contractual arrangement (for example, a management contract) may in substance constitute a loan
if the arrangement transfers tax ownership of the facility to a nongovernmental person. Similarly, an output contract
with respect to a financed facility generally is not treated as a loan of proceeds unless the agreement in substance
shifts significant burdens and benefits of ownership to the nongovernmental purchaser or manager of the facility.


(2) 

Exception if no use of bonds proceeds

. Any use of proceeds that does not, treating the user as a nongovernmental person that is not a natural person, give
rise to private business use, is not a loan of proceeds. See  1.141-3. 

(3) 

Hazardous waste remediation bonds

. In the case of an issue of hazardous waste remediation bonds, payments from nongovernmental persons that are either
users of the site being remediated or persons potentially responsible for disposing of hazardous waste on that site
do not indicate a loan for purposes of this section. This paragraph (b)(3) applies only if those payments do not secure
the payment of principal of, or interest on, the bonds (directly or indirectly), under the terms of the bonds and those
payments are not taken into account under the private payment test pursuant to  1.141-4(f)(3). 

(4) 

Prepayments

. A prepayment does not result in a loan of proceeds if the prepayment is not investment-type property. In applying
the definition of investment-type property under  1.148-1, providing the benefits of tax-exempt financing
to the seller of the property or service is treated as an investment return to the issuer. 

(5) 

Grants

_(i) 

In general

. A grant of proceeds is not a loan. Whether a transaction is a grant or a loan depends on all the facts and circumstances.


(ii) 

Tax increment financing

_(A) 

In general

. Generally, a loan does not result from the making of a grant using proceeds of an issue that is secured by generally
applicable taxes attributable to the improvements to be made with the grant unless the grantee makes any special agreements
relating to the payment that results in those taxes failing to be generally applicable under  1.141-4(e).


(B) 

Amount of loan

. If a grant is treated as a loan under this paragraph (b)(5), the entire grant is treated as a loan unless the special
agreement is limited to a specific portion of the related tax. 

(c) 

Tax assessment bond exception

_(1) 

General rule

. For purposes of this section, a tax assessment loan that meets the requirements of this paragraph (c) is not a loan.


(2) 

Tax assessment loan defined

_(i) 

In general

. A tax assessment loan is a loan that arises for federal tax purposes when a governmental unit permits or requires its
residents to pay a tax or assessment over a period of years. The tax assessment loan exception may apply if the assessed
property is used by a nongovernmental person in its trade or business (whether or not private business use) or for nonbusiness
purposes. In addition, a tax assessment loan must satisfy the following requirements:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941230-1-00045 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(A) 

Mandatory tax or assessment.

 The loan must arise from the imposition of a mandatory tax or other assessment of general application.
(B) 

Essential governmental function.

 The mandatory tax or assessment (collectively, 

assessments

) must be imposed for one or more specific, essential governmental functions (as opposed to installment payments
of property taxes or other taxes);
(C) 

Equal basis requirement.

 If the property that is subject to the tax or assessment is used by a nongovernmental person, owners of both business
and nonbusiness property benefiting from the financed improvements are eligible or required to make deferred payments
of the assessment on an equal basis (the 

equal basis requirement

).
(ii) [Reserved]
(3) 

Mandatory tax or other assessment.

 An assessment is an enforced contribution that is imposed and collected for the purpose of raising revenue to be used
for a specific purpose (that is, to defray the capital cost of an improvement). Assessments must be levied on a property
frontage basis, an ad valorem basis, or any other comparable method that results in equivalent mandatory assessment
to all residents benefiting from the improvements in an amount proportionate to the benefit to the assessed property.
Assessments do not include fees for services.
(4) 

Specific essential governmental function.

 For this purpose, in general, the term 

essential governmental function

 has the same meaning as under section 7871. An essential governmental function does not include any function to the
extent that it is not customarily performed (and financed with governmental bonds) by governments with general taxing
powers. In determining whether an activity is customarily performed by a governmental unit, isolated instances
of bond financing are disregarded. Examples of specific essential governmental functions for purposes of this section
include street paving and street-light installation, sewage treatment and disposal, and municipal water facilities,
but not commercial or industrial ventures. A specific essential governmental function does not include permitting
installment payments of property taxes or other taxes or any improvement to property owned by a nongovernmental person.
(5) 

Equal basis requirement

_(i) 

In general.

 An assessment does not satisfy the equal basis requirement if the terms for payment of the assessment are not the same
for all assessed persons (for example, if certain residents are permitted to pay the assessment over a period of years
while others must pay the entire assessment immediately or if the assessment is required to be prepaid when the property
is sold). In addition, the amounts payable and the rates used to determine those amounts must be determined on the basis
of non-discriminatory criteria. Thus, for example, an assessment does not satisfy the equal basis requirement if
imposed on a different basis for business and non-business beneficiaries. The equal basis requirement is not, however,
violated solely because an assessment varies on the basis of the relative benefit conferred.

<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Additional security.

 The equal basis requirement is not violated as a result of one benefitted party acquiring a guaranty of a third party
to pay debt service on bonds if it is not reasonably expected that payments will be made because of the additional assurances
that otherwise not have been made and the guarantor's recourse is limited to the assessments and the benefitted property.

(6) 

Coordination with private business tests.

 See   1.141-3 and 1.141-4 for rules for determining whether tax assessment loans cause the
bonds financing those loans to be private activity bonds under the private business use and the private security or
payment tests.

(d) 

Nonpurpose investment exception.

 Any loan that is a nonpurpose investment is not treated as a loan for purposes of this section. Thus, for example, proceeds
invested in loans such as obligations of the United States during any available temporary period, as part of a reasonably
required reserve or replacement fund, as part of a refunding escrow, or as part of a minor portion (as each of those terms
is defined under  1.148-1(b)) are not loans for purposes of this section. This paragraph (d) does not apply
to any nonpurpose investment acquired pursuant to a plan to avoid the limitations of section 141(c) and this section.

(e) 

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the application of this section:






Example 1.

 State agency Z and federal agency H will each contribute to rehabilitate a project owned by Z. H can only provide its
funds through a contribution to Z to be used to acquire the rehabilitated project on a turnkey basis from an approved
developer. Under H's turnkey program, the developer must own the project while it is rehabilitated. Z issues its notes
to provide funds for construction. A portion of the notes will be retired using the H contribution, and the balance
of the notes will be retired through the issuance by Z of long-term bonds. Z lends the proceeds of its note to Developer
B as construction financing and transfers title to B for a nominal amount. The conveyance is made on condition that
B rehabilitate the property and reconvey it upon completion, with Z retaining the right to force reconveyance if these
conditions are not satisfied. B must name Z as an additional insured on all insurance. Upon completion, B must transfer
title to the project back to Z at a set price, which price reflects B's costs and profit, not fair market value. Further,
this price is adjusted downward to reflect any cost-underruns. For purposes of section 141(c), this transaction
does not involve a private loan.



Example 2.

 Assessment district U issues bonds the proceeds of which are used to construct water and sewer improvements in the
district. At the time that the bonds are issued, all of the property in the district is owned by several developers,
each of which is in the trade or business of developing the property in the district for residential use. In accordance
with the procedures required by applicable State law, U imposes assessments on each parcel in the district. U requires
that, at the time that a developer sells a residential parcel, the developer must prepay the remaining amount of the
assessment. The assessments do not satisfy the equal basis requirement, because the payment terms are not the same
for all assessed persons.



 1.141-6 

Allocation and accounting rules.



(a) 

Allocation of proceeds to expenditures generally.

 For purposes of   1.141-1 through 1.141-16, the provisions of  1.148-6(d) apply
for purposes of allocating proceeds to expenditures, except that  1.148-6(d)(6) does not apply. Thus,
allocations generally may be made using any reasonable, consistently applied accounting method, and allocations
under section 141 and section 148 must be consistent with each other.

(b) 

Special rules for mixed use facilities

_(1) 

Allocation of expenditures to mixed use facilities.

 Proceeds may be specifically allocated to the expenditures comprising a discrete portion of a mixed use facility.
To approximate the actual expenditures, a percentage of actual costs based on rental values or usable space may be
used if reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances.

(2) 

Mixed use facility defined

_(i) 

Discrete portions.

 A mixed use facility is a facility containing two or more discrete portions. A discrete portion of a mixed use facility
is a portion of a facility that consists of_

(A) Any separate and discrete portion of a facility (for example, a floor of a building, a portion of a building separated
by walls, partitions, or other physical barriers) to which use is limited (other than common area use); or

(B) An undivided ownership interest in an output facility, sewage facility, water collection, storage, or distribution
facilities, or any similar utility system (for example, railroads or fiber optic networks, but not airports or stadiums)
or a portion of such a facility that, if owned by a person other than the actual owner, would constitute an undivided
ownership interest.

<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Special rule for certain facilities.

 To the extent that a mixed use facility consists of discrete portions that are used for a government use in the same manner
as for a private business use, proceeds allocated to expenditures comprising one discrete portion may be subsequently
reallocated to expenditures comprising another discrete portion in that facility.
(iii) 

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b)(2).





Example 1. 

State S and Corporation C enter into an agreement under which C will lease for 20 years the third and fourth floors of
an 11-story office building to be constructed on land that S will acquire. S will occupy the grade floor and the remaining
eight floors of the building. S will issue $10 million of bonds the proceeds of which will be used to finance 10/11ths
of the cost of the purchase of the land and construction of the building. S will use other funds for the remaining costs
of the land and building. From the facts and circumstances presented, it is determined that an allocation of the costs
of the acquisition of land and the construction of the building to the leased space based on the ratio of area leased
to the entire building is reasonable. Thus, no proceeds are allocated to 1 of the 2 floors used by C.


Example 2. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 1

 except that some years after the building is placed in service, C and S agree that, in order to consolidate certain uses,
S will begin to occupy the third and fourth floors and C will begin to occupy the seventh and eighth floors, each of which
has an equal rental value. The result is the same as in 

Example 1.





(c) 

Allocation of disposition proceeds.

 Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c) and  1.141-1(c), disposition proceeds are allocated
under the rules of this section. If a transfer that produces disposition proceeds is made pursuant to an installment
sale or the property otherwise continues to have a nexus to the bonds, however, the disposition proceeds are allocated
to the transferred property.
(d) 

Allocation of common areas.

 The allocation of proceeds to common areas may be made according to any reasonable method that properly reflects the
proportionate benefit to be derived directly or indirectly by the users of the facility.
(e) 

Allocation of proceeds to bonds.

 Proceeds are allocated to bonds in a manner consistent with the allocation rules of  1.148-9(h).


 1.141-7

Special rules for output facilities.


(a) 

Private business use and private security or payments test

_(1) 

General rule.

 The purchase by one or more nongovernmental persons of more than 10 percent of the available output of an output facility
(including water facilities) financed with the proceeds of an issue may satisfy the private business use test and
the private security or payment test under section 141(b)(1) and (2). These tests are satisfied if that use has the
effect of transferring to those nongovernmental persons substantial benefits of owning the facilities and substantial
burdens of paying the debt service on bonds used (directly or indirectly) to finance the facilities (the 

benefits and burdens test

), so as to constitute the indirect use by those persons of (and the indirect payment by those persons of debt service
of) more than 10 percent of those proceeds.
(2) 

Application of benefits and burdens test.

 The benefits and burdens test is satisfied (and the bonds are private activity bonds under section 141(b)(1) and (2))
if each of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) Either_
(A) A nongovernmental person agrees pursuant to a contract to take, or take or pay for, more than 10 percent of the available
output of a facility; or
(B) Two or more nongovernmental persons, each of whom pays an average annual demand charge or other guaranteed minimum
payment during the contract term exceeding 1 percent of the average annual debt service with respect to the issue agree
to take or take or pay for more than 10 percent of the available output of a facility. For purposes of this section, contractual
conditions related to the production of output are disregarded;

(ii) Payments made or to be made with respect to contracts described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section by nongovernmental
persons (or by other persons under those contracts) exceed 10 percent of the debt service with respect to that issue
over the contract term, determined under the rules provided in  1.141-4 (that is, on a present value basis).

(3) 

Special rules and definitions.

 For purposes of this paragraph (a) the following special rules and definitions apply:

(i) 

Available output.

 The available output of a facility is determined by multiplying the number of units produced or to be produced by the
facility in one year by the number of years in the contract term of the issue issued to finance that facility. The number
of units produced or to be produced by a generating facility in one year is determined by reference to its nameplate
capacity or the equivalent (or where there is no nameplate capacity or the equivalent, its maximum capacity) and is
reduced to account for scheduled maintenance but not for reserves or other unutilized capacity. If nameplate capacity
or the equivalent is greater than 150 percent of the average expected output during the contract term, average expected
output is used in lieu of nameplate capacity. For transmission facilities and cogeneration facilities, available
output must be measured in a reasonable manner. For example, for short, radial transmission lines, thermal capacity
may be reasonable. Similarly, for a transmission network, the use of load share ratios, in a manner consistent with
the requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, may be reasonable.

(ii) 

Contract term.

 The contract term of an issue begins on the date the output facility is placed in service (but not earlier than the issue
date of the bonds), and ends on the final maturity date of the issue (determined without regard to any optional redemption
dates.) If a contract may be extended by the owner of the facility, the term of the contract includes the period for which
that contract may be so extended.

(iii) 

Refundings and extensions of maturity.

 In determining the contract term and debt service on an issue under paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section
if, on or before the issue date of an issue to finance a facility, the issuer makes a commitment (for example, in the bond
documents) to refund that issue with a refunding issue, the contract term and debt service are based on the final maturity
date of any bond of the refunding issue (determined without regard to any optional redemption dates).

(iv) 

Take or take or pay contracts.

 A 

take or pay contract 

is a contract under which the purchaser agrees to pay for the output under the contract, whether or not that output is
received by the purchaser. A 

take

 contract is a contract under which the purchaser agrees to pay for the output under the contract if the output facility
is capable of providing the service. In the case of a transmission facility, both agreements to provide firm transmission
services and agreements to provide transmission service comparable to the owner's own use are treated as a take or
take or pay contracts.

<TEXT>
 

(v) 

Certain requirements contracts treated as take or take or pay contracts

_(A) 

In general.

 An agreement by a nongovernmental person to purchase all of its output requirements (a 

requirements contract

) is not a take or take or pay contract unless the purchaser agrees to pay a guaranteed minimum payment or if the purchaser
has no substantial ability to purchase its output requirements from other sources.

(B) 

Requirements for certain contracts.

 A requirements contract entered into on or after the date that is 60 days after publication of final regulations is
a take or take or pay contract if the purchaser has priority rights to the output (or rights to control the allocation
of the available output), if it is reasonably expected that the purchaser will purchase at least 10 percent of the available
output of the facility, or if the purchaser under the contract is a regulated utility that is in the business of reselling
output of the type purchased. For these purposes, to the extent that the amount of output under the contract does not
increase, a contract is treated as entered into before the date that is 60 days after publication of final regulations
notwithstanding an extension of the contract term or changes to other terms of the contract, provided that there is
no change, directly or indirectly, in the parties to the contract and the weighted average maturity of the bonds financing
the facility is not extended.

(vi) 

Reasonable expectations determinations.

 The provisions of this paragraph (a) regarding renewals of output contracts and the issuer's requirements for output
from the facility are applied on the basis of the issuer's reasonable expectations as of the issue date.

(4) 

Benefits and burdens test not exclusive.

 The benefits and burdens test of this section is not the exclusive means by which bonds financing output facilities
may satisfy the private business use or private security or payment tests. Thus, for example, an output facility that
is leased to a nongovernmental person may satisfy the private business use test.

(b) 

Pooling, exchange, spot sales, and wheeling arrangements_

(1) 

Swapping and pooling arrangements.

 An agreement that provides for swapping or pooling of power by one or more governmental persons and one or more nongovernmental
persons does not result in private business use of the output facility owned by the governmental person if_

(i) 

Net importers.

 (A) Under the agreement, on an annual basis and without regard to emergency consumption, the governmental person
is a net importer of power (for example, output produced at a particular facility that is owned by a governmental person
is provided to a nongovernmental person in exchange for output with a greater value to be delivered by the nongovernmental
person at a different location); and

(B) The facilities are not designed differently, sized larger, built sooner, or constructed in a more costly manner
than is reasonably necessary for the ordinary customers of the owner of the facilities; or

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941230-1-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Temporary outages, etc.

 (A) The swapped power is approximately equal in value determined over periods of one year or less;

(B) The agreement is not a take or take or pay contract; and

(C) The purpose of the agreement is to enable each of the parties to satisfy different peak load demands or to accommodate
temporary outages.

(2) 

Certain conduit parties disregarded.

 The presence of a nongovernmental person acting solely as a conduit for the exchange of output among governmentally
owned and operated utilities is disregarded in determining whether the private business tests are satisfied with
respect to financed facilities other than those of the nongovernmental person.

(3) 

Spot sales.

 Spot sales of excess power capacity for temporary periods, other than pursuant to take or take or pay contracts, do
not result in private business use. For this purpose, a spot sale is a sale pursuant to a single agreement that is limited
to no more than 30 days' duration including renewal periods.

(4) 

Wheeling

_(i) 

General rule.

 Use of transmission facilities financed by an issue is not treated as private business use to the extent that it results
from an order or actions taken in response to (or to prevent) an anticipated order by the United States that those facilities
be used to provide transmission services to a particular nongovernmental person (including a requirement that the
owner or operator either purchase the output of a facility or provide transmission services). This paragraph (b)(4)
applies only if_

(A) The transmission facilities were financed based on the issuer's reasonable expectations regarding the amount
of wheeling anticipated;

(B) The terms of the transmission agreement are bona fide and arm's-length, and the new user pays consideration equal
to the fair market value for the use of the financed property (for example, as determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission); and

(C) No circumstances are present that indicate an attempt to avoid directly or indirectly the requirements of section
141.

(ii) 

Exceptions.

 This paragraph (b)(4) does not, however, apply to any transmission facilities (or portion thereof) that are_

(A) Made necessary by the agreement to provide transmission service, including improvements needed due to increased
loads;

(B) Designed differently, sized larger, built sooner, or constructed in a more costly manner than is reasonably necessary
for the ordinary customers of the owner of the transmission facilities; or

(C) In excess of the services that are reasonably necessary to the purchaser of the output being transmitted.

(iii) 

Special limitation.

 If the transmission services provided under this paragraph (b)(4) involve more than 20 percent of the facility financed
with proceeds of the issue, paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section applies only if the issuer takes a remedial action
described in  1.141-13 regarding the bonds allocable to that use. Paragraph (b)(4) of  1.141-13
does not apply for this purpose. This paragraph (b)(4)(iii) does not apply if substantially all of the consideration
for providing the transmission services is the provision of other output property (for example, transmission).

(c) 

Certain short term contracts.

 The purchase of the output of an output facility by a nongovernmental person pursuant to an output contract is not treated
as private business use if:

(1) As of the later of the issue date or the date the contract is entered into, the issuer reasonably expects that at the
expiration of that agreement the related output will not be used for a private business use (determined without regard
to this paragraph (c)) and no subsequent deliberate actions are taken that are inconsistent with this reasonable
expectation;

(2) The contract has a term not in excess of 1 year and cannot be renewed or extended beyond this 1-year term; and

(3) The facilities are not designed differently, sized larger, built sooner, or constructed in a more costly manner
than is reasonably necessary for the ordinary customers of the owner of the facilities.

(d) 

Allocations of output facilities and systems_

(1) 

Facts and circumstances analysis.

 Whether output sold under a contract is allocated to a particular facility (for example, a generating unit), to the
entire system of the seller of that output (net of any uses of that system output allocated to a particular facility),
or to a portion of a facility is based on all the facts and circumstances, including whether the transaction is inconsistent
with the purpose of section 141. In general, output is allocated to a facility or system only to the extent that it is
physically possible. For example, output from a generating unit that is fed directly into a lower voltage distribution
system of the owner of that unit generally cannot leave that distribution system and, therefore, must be allocated
to those receiving electricity through that distribution system. Output may be allocated without regard to physical
limitations, however, if exchange agreements, or similar agreements, provide output to a purchaser where, but for
the exchange agreements, it would not be possible for the seller to provide output to that purchaser.

(2) 

Factors. 

Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, contractual terms relating to the delivery of the output (such
as delivery limitations and options or obligations to deliver power from additional sources) are the most significant
factor in allocating output to a facility or system. For example, a contract to provide a specified amount of electricity
from a system, but only when at least that amount of electricity is being generated by a particular unit, generally
is allocated to that unit. Similarly, a contract to buy 20 Mw of system power with a right to take up to 40 percent of the
actual output of a specific 50 Mw facility whenever total system output is insufficient to meet all of the seller's
obligations generally is allocated to the specific facility rather than the system. The method of pricing output
under the contract and the consistency of the contract with commercially reasonable terms are also significant factors.
For example, output sold under a contract to provide peaking capacity from a combustion turbine generally is allocated
to that turbine if the contract provides for pricing that is typical of peaking unit pricing, this pricing is based
on the capital and generating costs of that turbine, or no power need be delivered if that turbine is inoperable.

(3) 

Allocations among users. 

A facility or system (or portion thereof) that, under this paragraph (d), is allocable to two or more users generally
is allocated among those users on a ratable basis. Payments for output provided by an output facility financed with
two or more issues of bonds generally are allocated ratably among the issues according to the relative amounts of proceeds
of each issue used to finance that facility.

(4) 

Electric transmission facilities. 

If a contract for use of a transmission facility provides for payments for transmission services using a more accurate
method of measuring the transmission facilities used than the contract path specified by the parties (for example,
a method that accounts for loop flow or a method based on load share ratios of a network), that method must be used to determine
use under this paragraph. In other cases, the determination of use of an electric transmission facility may be based
on the contract path specified by the parties to the contract, if reasonable.

(5) 

Conservation facilities. 

In general, the financing of an output conservation improvement is treated as the acquisition of an output facility
by the utility sponsoring the improvement. The use of a conservation improvement is allocated under the rules in this
paragraph (d). Thus, generally, the output attributable to a conservation improvement is allocable to the beneficiary
of that output.

(e) 

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the application of this section.






Example 1. Joint ownership.

 Z, a privately owned electric utility, and City H agree to construct an electric generating facility of a size sufficient
to take advantage of the economies of scale. H will issue $50 million of its 25-year bonds and Z will use $100 million
of its funds for construction of a facility they will jointly own as tenants in common. Each of the participants will
share in the ownership, output, and operating expenses of the facility in proportion to its contribution to the cost
of the facility, that is, one-third by H and two-thirds by Z. H's bonds will be secured by H's ownership in the facility
and by revenues to be derived from its share of the annual output of the facility. Because H will need only 50 percent
of its share of the annual output of the facility during the first 20 years of operations, it agrees to sell Z 10 percent
of its share of that annual output for a period of 20 years pursuant to a contract under which Z agrees to take that power
if available. The facility will begin operation and Z will begin to receive power 4 years after the H bonds are issued
and, therefore, the contract term of the issue will be 21 years. H also agrees to sell the remaining excess portion of
its share of the annual output (40 percent) to numerous other private utilities under a prevailing rate schedule,
including demand charges. No contracts will be executed obligating any person other than Z to purchase any specified
amount of the power for any specified period of time and no person (other than Z) will pay a demand charge or other minimum
payment under conditions which, under paragraph (a) of this section, result in a transfer of substantial benefits
of ownership and substantial burdens of paying the debt service on bonds used directly or indirectly to provide those
facilities. The bonds are not private activity bonds because H's one-third interest in the facility (financed with
proceeds) is treated as a discrete portion of a mixed use facility and, although 10 percent of H's interest in the annual
output of the facility will be used, directly or indirectly, in the trade or business of Z, a non-governmental person,
under the rule in paragraph (a) of this section, that portion constitutes not more than 10 percent of the available
output of the facility. If more than 10 percent of the available output of the facility were to be sold to Z pursuant to
a take or pay contract and more than 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds were to be paid or secured by Z, the bonds
would be private activity bonds under paragraph (a) of this section.



Example 2. 

Power Authority K, a political subdivision created by the legislature in State X to own and operate certain power generating
facilities, sells all of the power from its existing facilities to four private utility systems under contracts executed
in 1990, under which the four systems are required to take or pay for specified portions of the total power output until
the year 2020. Currently, existing facilities supply all of the present needs of the four utility systems but their
future power requirements are expected to increase substantially. K issues 20-year bonds to construct a large generating
facility. A fifth private utility system contracts with K to take or pay for 15 percent of the available output of the
new facility. The balance of the output of the new facility will be available for sale as required, but initially it
is not anticipated there will be any need for that power. The revenues from the contract with the fifth private utility
system will be sufficient to pay less than 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds (determined on a percent value
basis). The balance, which will exceed 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds, will be paid from revenues from the
contracts with the four systems from sale of power produced by the old facilities. The bonds meet the private business
use test because more than 10 percent of the proceeds will be used in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person.
In addition, the bonds meet the private payment or security test because payment of more than 10 percent of the debt
service, pursuant to an underlying arrangement, will be derived from payments in respect of property used for a private
business use. Therefore, the bonds are private activity bonds.



Example 3. 

Municipal utility U, a political subdivision, purchases all of the electricity required to meet the needs of its customers
(1,000 Mw) from B, an investor-owned utility that operates its own electric generating facilities, under a 50-year
take or pay contract. Although U does not anticipate that it will require additional electric resources and any new
resources would produce electricity at a higher cost to U than its cost under its contract with B, B encourages U to construct
new resources sufficient to meet the requirements of U's customers. U issues obligations to construct facilities
that will produce 1,000 Mw of electricity. B, U, and I, another investor-owned utility, enter into an agreement under
which U assigns to I its rights under U's take or pay contract with B. Under this arrangement, I will make payments to
U and U will continue to make payments to B for the 1,000 Mw it is entitled to under the original take or pay contract. The
payments made by I to U will be equal to or greater than the amounts required to pay the debt service on U's bonds. Under
paragraph (d) of this section, U's obligations are financing a facility in a manner that is inconsistent with the purposes
of section 141 and, therefore, the take or pay contract under which I purchases electricity is allocable to U's new
facilities. Because I is a nongovernmental person, U's bonds are private activity bonds.



Example 4. Transmission network. 

In response to an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (

FERC

), municipal utility V and investor-owned utility W enter into an agreement for the shared use of W's transmission
facilities and transmission facilities that V is to construct (collectively, the 

network

). Both V and W require shared use of the entire network, rather than point-to-point service. Pursuant to the agreement,
V issues its bonds to construct new transmission facilities. The FERC order provides for sharing of costs of the network
using relative load share ratios. Under this methodology, V will be responsible for 40 percent of the load share of
the network. Under all the facts and circumstances, relative load share ratios is a reasonable method of measuring
the capacity and use of the network. V and W reasonably expect that, on an annual basis, more than 90 percent of the amounts
owed to V for use of its facilities will be paid for in kind (that is, through the provision of transmission services
on W's facilities). The agreement provides that V and W will be entitled to transmission services that are comparable
to the owner's own use. V reasonably expects that, due to the isolated location of the network, no other parties will
seek to use V's transmission facilities. Under these circumstances, W will use more than 10 percent of the available
output of the facilities financed with V's bonds and more than 10 percent of the debt service on V's bonds will be paid
by W. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, however, W's use of the financed facilities will not be treated as private
business use if those facilities are financed based on V's reasonable expectations regarding the amount of wheeling
anticipated and the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) and (iii) are satisfied. Although W's use of the financed
facilities involves more than 20 percent of the property financed with the proceeds of the issue, because substantially
all of the consideration for this use is the provision of other transmission services, the limitation in paragraph
(b)(4)(iii) of this section does not apply. Assuming that the financed facilities are not necessitated by the need
to provide transmission to W and that the other conditions of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section are satisfied, W's
use of the financed facilities will not cause V's bonds to be private activity bonds.

 1.141-8


$15 million limitation for output facilities.


(a) 

In general

_(1) 

General rule. 

Section 141(b)(4) provides a special private activity bond limitation (the 

$15 million output limitation

) for issues 5 percent or more of the proceeds of which are to be used to finance output facilities. Under this rule, a
bond is a private activity bond under the private business tests of section 141(b) (1) and (2) if the nonqualified amount
with respect to output facilities financed by the proceeds of the issue exceeds $15 million. The $15 million output
limitation applies in addition to the private business tests of section 141(b) (1) and (2). In addition, under section
141(b)(4) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the $15 million limitation is reduced in certain cases. Specifically,
under the $15 million output limitation, the private business use test and the private security or payment test apply
as follows:



(i) 

Private business use test

. An issue to which the $15 million limitation applies meets the private business use test if more than $15 million of
the sale proceeds of the issue to be used with respect to an output facility are to be used for a private business use.
(ii) 

Private security or payment test

. An issue to which the $15 million limitation applies meets the private security or payment test if the payment of the
principal of, or the interest on, more than $15 million of the sale proceeds of the portion of the issue used with respect
to an output facility is (under the terms of the issue or any underlying arrangement) directly or indirectly_
(A) Secured by any interest in an output facility used or to be used for a private business use (or payments in respect
of such an output facility); or



(B) To be derived from payments (whether or not to the issuer) in respect of an output facility used or to be used for a
private business use.
(2) 

Reduction in $15 million output limitation for outstanding issues

_(i) 

General rule. 

In determining whether an issue more than 5 percent of the proceeds of which are to be used with respect to an output facility
consists of private activity bonds under the $15 million output limitation, the $15 million limitation on private
business use and the $15 million limitation on the private security or payment test are each applied by taking into
account any outstanding issues of tax-exempt bonds with respect to that output facility or any other output facility
that is part of the same project. Thus, the $15 million limitation on private business use for an issue is reduced by
the amount of private business use for that same project financed by any other outstanding tax-exempt bonds. Similarly,
the $15 million limitation on the private security or payment test is reduced by the amount of private security or payments
for that same project for any other outstanding tax-exempt bonds.
(ii) 

Bonds taken into account

. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), in applying the $15 million output limitation to an issue (the 

later issue

), a tax-exempt bond of another issue (the 

earlier issue

) is taken into account if_
(A) The earlier issue is outstanding on the issue date of the later issue;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941230-1-00054 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(B) The earlier issue will not be redeemed within 90 days of the issue date of the later issue in connection with the refunding
of the earlier issue by the later issue; and
(C) More than 5 percent of the sale proceeds of the earlier issue financed an output facility that is part of the same
project as the output facility that is financed by more than 5 percent of the sale proceeds of the later issue.

(3) 

Benefits and burdens test applicable

_(i) 

In general.

 In applying the $15 million output limitation, the benefits and burdens test of  1.141-7 applies, except
that ``$15 million'' is substituted for ``10 percent''. For this purpose, the amount of private business use with
respect to an output facility financed by an issue is determined by multiplying the percentage of private business
use over the contract term of the issue by the issue price of the issue.
(ii) 

Earlier issues for the project. 

If an earlier issue is outstanding that must be taken into account under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the amount
of private business use and private security or payments for that issue (as determined under paragraph (a)(3)(i)
of this section) is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the greater of the outstanding principal amount
or present value of the outstanding bonds of the earlier issue as of the issue date of the later issue, and the denominator
of which is the issue price of the earlier issue as of the issue date of that issue.
(b) 

Definition of project

_(1) 

General rule.

 For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 

project

 has the meaning provided in this paragraph. Facilities having different purposes or serving different customer
bases are not ordinarily part of the same project. For example, the following are generally not part of the same project:
(i) generation and transmission facilities;
(ii) separate facilities designed to serve wholesale customers and retail customers; and
(iii) a peaking unit and a baseload unit.
(2) 

Separate ownership.

 Facilities that are not owned by the same person are not part of the same project. All participants in a joint powers
authority that issues bonds to finance a project are treated as related parties for purposes of applying the $15 million
limitation to bonds financing the same project. In the case of undivided ownership interests in a single output facility,
property that is not owned by the same person is treated as separate projects only if the separate interests are not
financed_
(i) With bonds of a single issuer; and
(ii) With a principal purpose of avoiding the limitation in this section.
(3) 

Generating property

_(i) 

Property on same site.

 In the case of property for the generation of output and related facilities (

generating property

), 

project

 means property located at the same site.
(ii) 

Special rule for generating units.

 Separate generating units (and related facilities) are not a part of the same project if one is placed in service (determined
under  1.150-2(c)) more than 3 years before the other. Common facilities or property that will be functionally
related to more than one generating unit must be allocated on a reasonable basis. If a generating unit already is constructed
or is under construction (the 

first unit

) and bonds are to be issued to finance an additional generating unit (the 

second unit

), all costs for any common facilities paid or incurred before the earlier of the issue date of bonds to finance the second
unit or the commencement of construction of the second unit are allocated to the first unit. At the time that bonds are
issued to finance the second unit (or, if earlier, upon commencement of construction of that unit), any remaining
costs of the common facilities may be allocated among the first and second units so that in the aggregate the allocation
is reasonable.
(4) 

Transmission.

 In the case of property for the transmission of output and related facilities, 

project

 means functionally related or contiguous property used for transmission of output but only to the extent that the
property is placed in service during a single 2-year period. Separate property is not part of a single project, however,
unless it is intended to provide transmission between two significant output facilities (for example, a line to connect
two substations).
(5) 

Subsequent improvements. 

An improvement to generating or transmission property that is not part of the original design of that property (the


initial project

) is not part of the same project as the initial project if the construction, reconstruction, or acquisition of that
improvement commences more than three years after the initial project is placed in service and the bonds issued to
finance that improvement are issued more than three years after the initial project is placed in service.

(6) 

Conservation. 

In the case of property to provide energy conservation, 

project 

means functionally related property that is located at a single site.
(7) 

Replacement property. 

For purposes of this section, output property that replaces existing output property is treated as part of the same
project as the replaced output property unless_
(i) The need to replace the property was unexpected or occurred more than 3 years in advance of the expected need to replace
the property; and
(ii) The bonds that financed (and refinanced) the replaced output property have a weighted average maturity that
is not greater than the reasonably expected economic life of the replaced output property.
(c) 

Examples. 

The application of the provisions of this section is illustrated by the following examples:





Example 1. 

Power authority K, a political subdivision, intends to issue a single issue of tax-exempt bonds to finance the construction
of an electric generating facility under a turnkey construction contract providing for a single payment of $500 million
at the completion of construction. No portion of the facility will be used for a private business use except that L,
an investor-owned utility, will purchase 10 percent of the output of the facility under a take contract and will pay
10 percent of the debt service on the bonds. The maximum amount of tax-exempt bonds that may be issued for the acquisition
of the facility is $465 million (that is, $450 million for the 90 percent of the facility that is governmentally owned
and used, and a maximum of $15 million for the privately used portion).


Example 2. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 1 

except that the construction contract calls for milestone payments every 6 months beginning July 1, 1995. K intends
to finance the facility with 4 separate issues of tax-exempt bonds. On July 1, 1995, K issues the first issue for $100
million and makes the first milestone payment. On January 1, 1996, K intends to issue the second issue for the facility
for $150 million and use the proceeds of that issue to make the second milestone payment. As of January 1, 1996, no other
amounts have been paid under the construction contract for the facility and none of the bonds issued on July 1, 1995,
have been retired. The January 1, 1996, issue will consist of private activity bonds since the issue will have $15 million
of private business use and private payments or security (10 percent of $150 million) and the maximum permitted private
use portion for the second issue is only $5 million ($15 million less than $10 million private use portion of the first
issue). For each subsequent issue for the facility and assuming that the January 1, 1996, issue consisted of tax-exempt
bonds, K could not issue tax-exempt bonds to finance the portion of the facility used by L.



 1.141-9 

Unrelated or disproportionate use test.



(a) 

General rules_

(1) 

Description of test.

 Under section 141(b)(3) (the 

unrelated or disproportionate use test

), an issue meets the private business tests if the amount of private business use and private security or payments
attributable to unrelated or disproportionate private business use exceeds 5 percent of the proceeds of the issue.
For this purpose, the private business use test is applied by taking into account only use that is not related to any
government use of proceeds of the issue (

unrelated use

) and use that is related but disproportionate to any government use of those proceeds (

disproportionate use

). The private security or payment test is applied by taking into account the payments of the principal of, or the interest
on, the proceeds of the issue that are (under the terms of the issue or any underlying arrangement) directly or indirectly_
(i) Secured by any interest in (A) property used or to be used for a private business use that is either unrelated use
or disproportionate use, or (B) payments in respect of this property; or
(ii) To be derived from payments (whether or not to the issuer) in respect of property, or borrowed money, used or to
be used for a private business use that is either unrelated use or disproportionate use.
(2) 

Application of unrelated and disproportionate use test_

(i) 

Order of application.

 The unrelated and disproportionate use test is applied by first determining whether a private business use is related
to a government use. Next, private business use that relates to a goverment use is examined to determine whether it
is disproportionate to that govenment use.
(ii) 

Aggregation of unrelated and disproportionate use. 

All unrelated use and disproportionate use financed with the proceeds of an issue are aggregated to determine compliance
with the unrelated or disproportionate use test. The amount of permissible unrelated and disproportionate private
business use is not reduced by the amount of private business use financed with the proceeds of an issue that is neither
unrelated use nor disproportionate use.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) 

Deliberate actions. 

A deliberate action that occurs after the issue date does not result in unrelated or disproportionate use if the issue
meets the conditions of  1.141-13(a).

(b) 

Unrelated use

_(1) 

In general. 

Whether a private business use is related to a government use financed with the proceeds of an issue is determined on
a case-by-case basis, emphasizing the operational relationship between the government uses and the private business
uses. In general, a facility that is used for a related private business use must be located within, or adjacent to,
the governmentally used facility.

(2) 

Parallel related and unrelated uses. 

Use of a facility by a nongovernmental person for the same purpose as use by a governmental person is not treated as unrelated
use if the government use is not insignificant. Similarly, a use of a facility in the same manner both for private business
use that is related use and private business use that is unrelated use does not result in unrelated use if the related
use is not insignificant. For example, a privately owned pharmacy in a governmentally owned hospital does not ordinarily
result in unrelated use solely because the pharmacy also serves individuals not using the hospital. In addition,
use of parking spaces in a garage by a nongovernmental person is not treated as unrelated use if more than an insignificant
portion of the parking spaces are used for a government use (or a private business use that is related to a government
use), even though the use by the nongovernmental person is not directly related to that other use.

(c) 

Disproportionate use

_(1) 

Definition of disproportionate use. 

A private business use is disproportionate to a related government use only to the extent that the amount of proceeds
used for that private business use exceeds the amount of proceeds used for the related government use. For example,
a private use of $100 of proceeds that is related to a government use of $70 of proceeds results in $30 of disproportionate
use.

(2) 

Aggregation of related uses. 

If two or more private business uses of the proceeds of an issue relate to a single government use of those proceeds,
those private business uses are aggregated to apply the disproportionate use test.

(3) 

Allocation rule. 

If a private business use relates to more than a single use of the proceeds of the issue (for example, two or more government
uses of the proceeds of the issue or a government use and a private use), the amount of any disproportionate use may be
determined by:

(i) reasonably allocating the proceeds used for the private business use among the related uses,

(ii) aggregating government uses that are directly related to each other, or

(iii) allocating the private business use to the government use to which it is primarily related.

(d) 

Maximum use taken into account. 

The determination of the amount of unrelated use or disproportionate use of a facility is based on the maximum amount
of reasonably expected government use of a facility during the term of the issue. Thus, no unrelated use or disproportionate
use arises solely because a facility initially has excess capacity that is to be used by a nongovernmental person if
the facility will be completely used by the issuer during the term of the issue for more than an insignificant period.

(e) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the application of this section:







Example 1. School and remote cafeteria. 

County X issues bonds with proceeds of $20 million and uses $18.1 million of the proceeds for construction of a new school
building and $1.9 million of the proceeds for construction of a privately operated cafeteria in its administrative
office building, which is located at a remote site. The bonds are secured, in part, by the cafeteria. The $1.9 million
of proceeds is unrelated to the government use (that is, school construction) financed with the bonds and exceeds
5 percent of $20 million. Thus, the issue meets the private business tests.



Example 2. Public safety building and courthouse. 

City Y issues bonds with proceeds of $50 million for construction of a new public safety building ($32 million) and
for improvements to an existing courthouse ($15 million). Y uses $3 million of the bond proceeds for renovations to
an existing privately operated cafeteria located in the courthouse. The bonds are secured, in part, by the cafeteria.
Y's use of the $3 million for the privately operated cafeteria does not meet the unrelated or disproportionate use
test since these expenditures are neither unrelated use nor disproportionate use.

Example 3. Unrelated garage. 

City Y issues bonds with proceeds of $50 million for construction of a new public safety building ($30.5 million) and
for improvements to an existing courthouse ($15 million). Y uses $3 million of the bond proceeds for renovations to
an existing privately operated cafeteria located in the courthouse. The bonds are secured, in part, by the cafeteria.
Y also uses $1.5 million of the proceeds to construct a privately operated parking garage adjacent to a private office
building. The private business use of the parking garage is unrelated to any government use of proceeds of the issue.
Since the proceeds used for unrelated uses and disproportionate uses do not exceed 5 percent of the proceeds, the unrelated
or disproportionate use test is not met. 



Example 4. Disproportionate use of garage. 

County Z issues bonds with proceeds of $20 million for construction of a hospital with no private business use ($17
million); renovation of an office building with no private business use ($1 million); and construction of a garage
that is entirely used for a private business use ($2 million). The use of the garage is related to the use of the office
building but not to the use of the hospital. The private business use of the garage results in $1 million of disproportionate
use because the proceeds used for the garage ($2 million) exceed the proceeds used for the related government use ($1
million). The bonds are not private activity bonds, however, because the disproportionate use does not exceed 5 percent
of the proceeds of the issue. 



Example 5. Bonds for multiple projects. 

(i) County X issues bonds with proceeds of $80 million for the following purposes: (1) $72 million to construct a County
owned and operated waste incinerator; (2) $1 million for a County owned and operated facility for the temporary storage
of hazardous waste prior to final disposal; (3) $1 million to construct a privately owned recycling facility; and
(4) $6 million to build a garage adjacent to the County owned incinerator that will be leased to Company Y to store and
repair trucks that it owns and uses to haul County X refuse. Company Y uses 75 percent of its trucks to haul materials
to the incinerator and the remaining 25 percent of its trucks to haul materials to the temporary storage facility.


(ii) The $1 million of proceeds used for the recycling facility is used for an unrelated use. The garage is related use.
In addition, 75 percent of the use of the $6 million of proceeds used for the garage is allocable to the government use
of proceeds at the incinerator. The remaining 25 percent of the garage ($1.5 million) relates to the government use
of proceeds at the temporary storage facility. Thus, this portion of the proceeds used for the garage exceeds the proceeds
used for the temporary storage facility by $.5 million and this excess is disproportionate use (but not unrelated
use). Thus, the aggregate amount of unrelated use and disproportionate use financed with the proceeds of the issue
is $1.5 million. Alternatively, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the entire garage may be treated as
related to the government use of the incinerator and, under that allocation, the garage is not disproportionate use.
In either event, section 141(b)(3) limits the aggregate unrelated use and disproportionate use to $4 million. Therefore,
the bonds are not private activity bonds under this section. 



 1.141-10 


Coordination with volume cap. 



Section 141(b)(5) provides a special definition of private activity bond for bonds having a nonqualified amount
of more than $15 million. The provisions of   1.141-1 through 1.141-16 (except  1.141-12)
apply to section 141(b)(5). 



 1.141-11 


Acquisition of nongovernmental output property. 



Section 141(d) provides a special definition of private activity bond for bonds the proceeds of which are used to acquire
nongovernmental output property. The provisions of   1.141-1 through 1.141-16 (except
 1.141-12) apply to section 141(d). 



 1.141-12 


Special rules for qualified bonds. 



(a) 

Actual compliance required

. Except as provided in  1.145-1 and this section, a private activity bond is a qualified bond only if the
issue of which it is a part satisfies all of the applicable requirements under section 141(e) throughout the term of
the issue. 

(b) 

Remedial actions available

_(1) 

In general

. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if an action results in nonqualified use, the remedial
actions in  1.141-13 (other than the actions permitted under  1.141-13(d)) may be applied
to prevent the bonds from ceasing to be treated as tax-exempt bonds (but not to failures existing as of the issue date).


(2) 

Nonqualified use

. For purposes of this section, nonqualified use means failures to satisfy the applicable requirements of section
142 (except paragraph (d)), 144 (except paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(10)), 147(c), 147(d), 147(e), or 147(f). 

(c) 

Limitation on remedial action

_(1) 

Failure to spend proceeds

. In the case of a failure to spend on qualifying costs the percentage of net proceeds required under sections 142(a),
144(a)(1), 144(b), or 144(c)(1), paragraph (b) of this section applies only if the amount of the issue was based on
reasonable estimates of the cost of facilities (or other property) to be provided by the issue and the failure to expend
the net proceeds on qualifying costs was due to circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the issue
date.

<PARENT> FR941230-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) 

Amount of nonqualified bonds

. For failures described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the nonqualified bonds for purposes of paragraph (b)
of this section are those bonds having an amount that, if treated as redeemed, would result in the net proceeds of the
remaining bonds of the issue satisfying the requirement for the percentage of the net proceeds to be used for qualifying
costs.



 1.141-13 

Deliberate actions and related remedial actions.



(a) 

Remedial action.

 An action that causes the private business tests or the private loan financing test to be met is not treated as a deliberate
action if the issuer takes a remedial action described in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section with respect
to the nonqualified bonds and all of the following requirements are met:

(1) 

Required covenants

. The issuer covenants on the issue date in the bond documents for the issue that it will take no action that would cause
the bonds to be private activity bonds and that it will not fail to take any action that would prevent the bonds from being
private activity bonds, and the issuer established reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with this covenant.

(2) 

Fair market value consideration

. The terms of any agreements that result in satisfaction of either the private business tests or the private loan financing
test are bona fide and arm's-length, and the new user pays consideration equal to the fair market value for the use of
the financed property.

(3) 

Expectations must be certified

. An officer of the issuer responsible for issuing the bonds, in good faith, certifies as part of the bond documents
the issuer's expectations as of the issue date, including the facts and estimates that form the basis for the issuer's
expectations regarding the use of proceeds of the issue. The certification is evidence of the issuer's expectations,
but does not establish any conclusions or presumptions of law or fact. A certification under this paragraph (a)(3)
is not required if the issue price of the issue does not exceed $1,000,000.

(4) 

No abuse

. No circumstances are present that indicate an attempt to avoid directly or indirectly the requirements of section
141.

(b) 

Redemption of nonqualified bonds

_(1) 

Transfer for cash

. If the financed facility is transferred exclusively for cash (a 

transfer for cash

), the requirements of this paragraph (b) are satisfied if an amount equal to the disposition proceeds are used to redeem
a pro rata portion of the nonqualified bonds at the earliest call date after the deliberate action. If the bonds are
not redeemed within 90 days of the date of the transfer, the disposition proceeds must be used to establish a defeasance
escrow for those bonds within 90 days of that date.

(2) 

Other deliberate actions

. If the deliberate action does not exclusively involve a transfer for cash, funds other than proceeds of a tax-exempt
bond must be used to redeem all the nonqualified bonds. If the bonds are not redeemed within 90 days of the date of the
deliberate act, a defeasance escrow must be established for those bonds within 90 days of that date.

(3) 

Notice of defeasance

. The issuer must provide written notice to the Commissioner of the establishment of the defeasance escrow within
180 days of the date of the transfer.

(4) 

Special limitation

. The establishment of a defeasance escrow does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b) if_

(i) The terms of the nonqualified bonds do not provide for a redemption of those bonds within 6 months of the date of the
deliberate action; and 

(ii) As of the issue date of the nonqualified bonds, there was more than a remote possibility that the financed property
would be transferred to a nongovernmental person during the period beginning on the issue date and ending on the date
the bonds can first be redeemed by the issuer. For this purpose, the possibility of transfer to a nongovernmental person
is treated as remote if the facility is of a type that is not customarily owned and operated by nongovernmental persons.

(5) 

Defeasance escrow defined

. A defeasance escrow is an irrevocable escrow established to redeem bonds at their earliest call date in an amount
that, together with investment earnings, is sufficient to pay all the principal of the interest and call premium on
the related bonds from the date the escrow is established to the earliest call date. If the amount of the nonqualified
bonds is limited to the amount of the disposition proceeds, the amount required to be deposited in the defeasance escrow
is limited to that amount. The escrow may not be invested in higher yielding investments or in any investment under
which the obligor is a user of the proceeds of the related bonds.

(c) 

Alternative use of facility.

 The requirements of this paragraph (c) are satisfied if_

(1) The facility with respect to which the deliberate action occurs is used in an alternative manner (for example,
used for a different purpose or used by a different person);

(2) The nonqualified bonds are treated as reissued, as of the date of the deliberate action, for purposes of sections
55 through 59 and 141 through 147, 149 and 150, and under this treatment, the nonqualified bonds satisfy all the applicable
requirements for qualified bonds throughout the remaining term of the nonqualified bonds (except as provided in
paragraph (g) of this section); and 

(3) The deliberate action does not involve a transfer to a purchaser that finances the acquisition with proceeds of
another issue of tax-exempt bonds.

(d) 

Alternative use of disposition proceeds.

 The requirements of this paragraph (d) are satisfied if_

(1) The deliberate action involves a transfer for cash of a facility financed by an issue or a repayment of a loan of proceeds;

(2) The nonqualified bonds are treated as reissued, as of the date of the deliberate action, for purposes of sections
141 through 147, 149 and 150, and under this treatment, the nonqualified bonds satisfy all the applicable requirements
for qualified 510(c)(3) bonds throughout the remaining term of the nonqualified bonds; and

(3) A remedial action that satisfies paragraph (b), (c), or (e) of this section is taken for any disposition proceeds
not used for an alternative use described in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.

(e) 

Authority of Commissioner to provide for additional remedial actions.

 The Commissioner may, by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, provide additional remedial actions under
which a subsequent action will not be treated as a deliberate action for purposes of  1.141-2.

(f) 

Effect of remedial action on continuing compliance.

 If a remedial action is taken under paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, the private business use, private
security or payments, or private loans resulting from the deliberate action are not taken into account for purposes
of determining whether the bonds are private activity bonds.

(g) 

Definition and special rules

_(1) 

Definition of nonqualified bonds.

 The nonqualified bonds are the outstanding bonds allocable to the proceeds with respect to which the deliberate action
was taken. The nonqualified bonds must be in an amount such that, if redeemed with sale proceeds of the issue, the proceeds
of the remaining bonds of the issue are used in a manner that does not cause the bonds to be private activity bonds. Allocations
to nonqualified bonds must be made in accordance with  1.141-6, except that allocations (i) must be made
on a pro rata basis (adjusted to reflect allocations permitted under  1.141-6); and (ii) may be made without
regard to whether property qualifies as a discrete portion of a mixed use facility.

(2) 

Section 147.

 For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, section 147(d) (relating to the acquisition of existing property)
is applied as of the issue date (not the date of the deliberate action).

(h) 

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the application of this section:






Example 1. Disposition proceeds less than outstanding bonds used to retire bonds.

 On June 1, 1995, City C issues bonds with an issue price of $10 million to finance the construction of a building. The
bonds have a weighted average maturity that does not exceed 120 percent of the weighted average economic life of the
building. On the issue date, C reasonably expects with a high degree of certainty that it will be the only user of the
building for the entire term of the bonds. Six years after the issue date, C sells the building to Corporation P for $5
million. The sale price is the fair market value of the building, as verified by an independent appraiser. C uses all
of the disposition proceeds to immediately retire a pro rata portion of the bonds. The bonds are not private activity
bonds because of the sale because P is not a user of process (that is, the disposition proceeds were used to redeem the
bonds). See  1.141-1(c).



Example 2. Lease to nongovernmental persons.

 The fact are the same as in 

Example 1

, except that instead of selling the building, C, six years after the issue date, leases the building to P for 7 years
and uses other funds to redeem all of the bonds within 90 days of the deliberate act. The bonds are not treated as private
activity bonds because C has taken remedial action described in paragraph (b) of this section.



Example 3. Sale for less than fair market value.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 1

, except that the fair market value of the building at the time of the sale to P is $6 million. Under these facts and  1.141-1(c),
the proceeds of the bonds remain allocated to the office building. Therefore, the proceeds of the bonds are used by
P. In addition, because the transfer was for less than fair market value, the bonds are ineligible for the remedial
actions under this section.



Example 4. Redemption of bonds.

 In 1995, City D issues bonds with proceeds of $10 million to finance a courthouse. The bonds have a weighted average
maturity that does not exceed 120 percent of the weighted average economic life of the courthouse. D uses $1 million
of the proceeds for a private business use and more than 10 percent of the debt service on the issue is secured by private
security or payments. D later sells one-half of the courthouse property to a nongovernmental person for cash. D immediately
redeems 50 percent of the outstanding bonds. For purposes of subsequently applying section 141 to the issue, D may
continue to use all of the proceeds of the outstanding bonds in the same manner (that is, for both the courthouse and
the existing private business use) without causing the issue to meet the private business tests. The result would
be the same if D, instead of redeeming the bonds, established a defeasance escrow for those bonds, provided that the
requirement of paragraph (b)(4) of this section was met as of the issue date.

 1.141-14

 Refunding issues.



(a) 

Private activity bond status

_(1) 

In general.

 Whether a refunding issue satisfies the private business tests or the private loan financing tests is determined
exclusively on the use of the proceeds of the refunding issue and the private security or payments with respect to that
issue (that is, without regard to whether the prior issue satisfied those tests).

(2) 

Rules of application

_(i) 

Private business use and private loan financing tests.

 In applying section 141 to a refunding issue, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2), the proceeds
of the refunding issue are treated as used for the same purposes as the proceeds of the prior issue except that the use
of the property financed with the proceeds of the prior issue before the issue date of the refunding issue is not taken
into account.

(ii) 

Special rule.

 If, as of the issue date of the refunding issue, the weighted average maturity of the refunding issue is greater than
120 percent of the remaining average economic life of the property financed with the proceeds of the prior issue, the
proceeds of the refunding issue are treated as being used for the same purposes as the proceeds of the prior issue and
use of the property financed with the proceeds of the prior issue before the issue date of the refunding issue is taken
into account.

(3) 

Optional treatment as continuation of prior issue.

 In applying the private business use test and the private security or payment test (including under  1.141-7)
to a refunding issue, the issuer may treat the entire refunding issue as a continuation of the prior issue. For this
purpose, under the private security or payment test (including under  1.141-7), the issuer may use the
yield on the refunded issue to present value payments and security from arrangements that were not entered into in
contemplation of the refunding issue.

(b) 

Qualified bonds

_(1) 

In general.

 Generally, whether bonds issued as part of a refunding issue are qualified bonds (other than bonds issued under sections
144(a) or 1394) is determined exclusively on the basis of the use of the proceeds of the refunding issue, determined
in the same manner as under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In addition, section 147(d) is applied as of the issue
date of the prior issue. A refunding issue meets the requirements of section 147(b) if the refunded issue met these
requirements and the weighted average maturity of the refunding bonds is not greater than the remaining weighted
average maturity of the refunded bonds. See also  1.103-8.

(2) 

Discontinued use in certain qualified bonds.

 If, as of the issue date of the refunding bonds, the property that was financed by the proceeds of the refunded bond is
not used (or is not reasonably expected to continue to be used), and the refunded bond was a qualified bond under sections
142, 144(a), 144(c), or 1394, the refunding bond is a qualified bond only if_

(i) The refunding issue does not have a weighted average maturity that exceeds the remaining weighted average maturity
of the refunded bonds; and

(ii) The refunded bonds were qualified bonds.

 1.141-15 

Anti-abuse rules.



(a) 

Authority of Commissioner to reflect substance of transactions. 

If an issuer enters into a transaction or series of transactions with respect to one or more issues with a principal
purpose of transferring to nongovernmental persons (other than as members of the general public) significant benefits
of tax-exempt financing in a manner that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 141, the Commissioner may take
any action to reflect the substance of the transaction or series of transactions, including_

(1) Treating separate issues as a single issue for purposes of the private activity bond test;

(2) Reallocating proceeds to expenditures, use, or bonds; and

(3) Reallocating payments to use or proceeds.

(b) 

Examples. 

The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:







Example 1. 

City D enters into a development agreement with Corporation T to induce T to locate its headquarters within the D city
limits. Pursuant to the development agreement, in 1995 D will issue $20 million of its general obligation bonds (the
1995 bonds) to purchase land that it will grant to T. The development agreement also provides that, in 1996, D will issue
$20 million of its tax increment bonds (the 1996 bonds), secured solely by the increase in property taxes in a special
taxing district made under the improvements resulting from the development agreement. Substantially all of the
property within the special taxing district is owned by T or D. T will separately enter into an agreement to guarantee
the payment of tax increment to D in an amount sufficient to retire the 1996 bonds. The proceeds of the 1996 bonds will
be used to finance governmentally owned and operated improvements within the special taxing district that will not
give rise to private business use. Treated separately, the 1995 issue meets the private business use test, but not
the private security or payment test; the 1996 issue meets the private security or payment test, but not the private
business use test. Because the two issues are a part of a plan to provide the benefits of tax-exempt financing to T for
its headquarters, however, the 1995 issue and the 1996 issue may be treated by the Commissioner as a single issue for
purposes of applying the private activity bond tests. Accordingly, the bonds of both the 1995 issue and the 1996 issue
may be treated as private activity bonds.



Example 2. 

City E acquires an electric generating facility with a useful economic life of more than 35 years and enters into a 25-year
take or pay contract to sell 30 percent of the available output to investor-owned utility M. E plans to use the remaining
70 percent of available output for its own governmental purposes. To finance the entire cost of the facility, E issues
$30 million of its series A taxable bonds at taxable interest rates and $70 million series B bonds, which purport to
be tax-exempt bonds, at tax-exempt interest rates. E allocates all of M's private business use to the proceeds of the
series A bonds and all of its own government use to the proceeds of the series B bonds. The series A bonds have a weighted
average maturity of 15 years, while the series B bonds have a weighted average maturity of 26 years. M's payments under
the take or pay contract are equal to 30 percent of M's total costs (that is, the sum of the debt service required to be
paid on both the series A and the series B bonds and all other operating costs). The allocation of all of M's private business
use to the series A bonds does not reflect economic substance because the series of transactions transfers to M significant
benefits of the tax-exempt interest rates paid on the series B bonds. Because of this actual transfer of benefits,
M's private business use must be allocated on a pro rata basis to both the series B bonds as well as the series A bonds.
Accordingly, both the series A bonds and the series B bonds are private activity bonds.



Example 3. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 2, 

except that the debt service component of M's payments under the take or pay contract is based exclusively on the amounts
necessary to pay the debt service on the series A bonds. E's allocation of all of M's private business use to the series
A bonds is respected because the series of transactions does not actually transfer benefits of tax-exempt interest
rates to M. Accordingly, the series B bonds are not private activity bonds. The result would be the same if the series
A bonds and the series B bonds had substantially equivalent weighted average maturities and E and M had entered into
a customary contract providing for payments based on a ratable share of total debt service.



 1.141-16

(b) 

Effective dates.

 Except as otherwise provided in this section, the private activity bond regulations apply to bonds issued on or after
the date that is 60 days after publication of final regulations in the 

Federal Register

 (the 

effective date

) that are subject to section 1301 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
(c) 

Refunding bonds.

 The private activity bond regulations do not apply to bonds issued on or after the effective date to refund a bond to
which the private activity bond regulations do not apply unless_
(1) The weighted average maturity of the refunding bonds is greater than the remaining weighted average maturity
of the refunded bonds; or
(2) A principal purpose for the issuance of the refunding bonds is to make one or more new conduit loans.
(d) 

Permissive application of regulations.

 Except as otherwise provided, the private activity bond regulations may be applied in whole, but not in part, to_
(1) Bonds issued after December 30, 1994 and before the effective date; or
(2) Refunding bonds issued on or after the effective date.
(e) 

Permissive retroactive application of certain sections.

 The following sections may each be applied to any bonds issued before the effective date:
(1) Section 1.141-6;
(2) Section 1.141-13; and
(3) Section 1.141-14.


Par. 5.

 Section 1.145-1 is added to read as follows:


 1.145-1

Qualified 501(c)(3) bonds.


(a) 

In general.

 In applying the requirements of section 145(a)(2),   1.141-1 through 1.141-16 apply to determine
whether use of the proceeds of an issue (or private payments or security with respect thereto) by a person (other than
a section 501(c)(3) organization using the proceeds in an activity that does not constitute an unrelated trade or
business) gives rise to private business use, private security or payments, or private loans.
(b) 

Reasonable expectations and deliberate actions_

(1) 

In general.

 Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), an issue is an issue of qualified 501(c)(3) bonds if the issuer
and the 501(c)(3) organization reasonably expect, as of the issue date, that the issue will meet the requirements
applicable to those bonds under section 141(e) and section 145. An issue ceases to be an issue of qualified 501(c)(3)
bonds if the issuer or 501(c)(3) organization takes a deliberate action, subsequent to the issue date, that causes
the bonds to fail to comply with the applicable requirements under section 141(e) and 145 (for example, revocation
of exempt status as a result of private inurement). For this purpose, deliberate actions are defined under  1.141-2.
In lieu of this paragraph (b),  1.141-12 applies for purposes of section 145(d)(2)(B) (related to certain
residential rental projects).
(2) 

Remedial actions.

 The remedial actions of  1.141-13 may be applied to prevent a deliberate action from causing an issue to
cease to be treated as tax-exempt bonds under section 145.
(c) 

Effective dates.

 For effective dates of this section, see  1.141-16.


Par. 6.

 Section 1.148-6 is amended by adding new paragraphs (a)(3) and (d)(1)(iii) to read as follows:


 1.148-6

General allocation and accounting rules.


(a) * * *
(3) 

Absence of allocation and accounting methods.

 If an issuer fails to maintain books and records sufficient to establish the accounting method for an issue and the
allocation of the proceeds of that issue, the rules of this section are applied using the specific tracing method.
This paragraph (a)(3) applies to bonds issued on or after the date that is 60 days after publication of final regulations
in the 

Federal Register

.


* * * * *


(d) * * *
(1) * * *
(iii) 

Timing.

 An issuer must account for the allocation of proceeds to expenditures not later than 18 months after the later of the
date the expenditure is paid or the date the project, if any, that is financed by the issue is placed in service. This
allocation must be made in any event by the date 60 days after the fifth anniversary of the issue date or the date 60 days
after the retirement of the issue, if earlier. This paragraph (d)(1)(iii) applies to bonds issued on or after the date
that is 60 days after publication of final regulations in the 

Federal Register

.

(2) 

Exception for taxable bonds

_(i) 

In general.

 Taxable and tax-exempt bonds are not part of the same issue under this paragraph (c).
(ii) 

Exceptions.

 The issuance of tax-exempt bonds in a transaction (or series of related transactions) that includes taxable bonds,
however, may constitute an abusive arbitrage device under  1.148-10(a), an abuse under  1.141-15(a),
or otherwise violate the requirements of sections 103 and 141 through 150, for example, structures involving 

windows

 or unreasonable allocations of bonds. This paragraph (c)(2)(ii) does not apply to a taxable issue with an issue price
that is less than 5 percent of the issue price of the related tax-exempt issue.
(3) * * *
(ii) 

Exceptions.

 This paragraph (c)(3) does not apply for purposes of sections 144(a), 148, 149(d), and 149(g).


* * * * *




Par. 8. 

Section 1.150-4 under the heading ``Standard deduction for individuals'' is added to read as follows:



 1.150-4 

Change in use of facilities financed with tax-exempt private activity bonds.


(a) 

In general.

 The change of use provisions of sections 150(b) and (c) apply even if the issuer takes the actions described in  1.141-13(b),
(c), (d), or (e).
(b) 

Allocation rules.

 If section 150(b) or (c) applies to a portion of an issue and the issuer has not taken a permitted remedial action under
 1.141-13 to maintain the status of the bonds as tax-exempt bonds, the portion of the issue to which section
150(b) applies is that portion that is the nonqualified bonds, within the meaning of  1.141-13(g)(1),
except that any common areas (as defined in  1.141-1) are entirely allocated to the nonqualified bonds.

(c) 

Effective dates.

 For effective dates of this section, see  1.141-16.

Par. 9. 

Section 1.1394-1 is added under the heading ``Definitions; special rule'' to read as follows:


 1.1394-1 

Enterprise zone facility bonds.


(a) 

Scope. 

This section contains rules relating to section 1394, relating to tax-exempt bonds for enterprise zone facilities
(

enterprise zone facility bonds

). See sections 1394, 1397B, and 1397C for other rules and definitions.
(b) 

Continuing compliance_

(1) 

In general. 

Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, compliance with the requirements applicable to enterprise
zone facility bonds apply throughout the term of the bonds.
(2) 

Start-up period. 

For a qualified business that is first established in connection with the issuance of enterprise zone facility bonds
(as opposed to a continuing qualified business to which financing is provided), the requirements relating to qualification
as an enterprise zone business and satisfaction of the rules for qualified zone property do not apply prior to the date
that is one year after the later of the issue date of the bonds and the date the financed facility is placed in service
(the 

testing date

).
(3) 

Manner of continuing compliance. 

An issue is treated as continuing to comply with the requirements of section 1394 (a) and (b) if_
(i) The issuer and each principal user in good faith attempts to meet these requirements throughout the term of the
bonds; and
(ii) Any failure to meet these requirements is corrected within a reasonable period after the failure is first discovered.
(4) 

Good faith. 

In order to satisfy the good faith requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the issuer and each principal
user must satisfy the requirements of  1.141-13(a) (relating to conditions to taking remedial actions).
For this purpose, reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with the requirements of section 1394 (a) and (b) include
a requirement that, at least annually, each principal user submit to the issuer information demonstrating its monitoring
of compliance with these requirements.
(5) 

Reasonable period to correct noncompliance. 

Noncompliance that is corrected within one year of discovery satisfies the requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)
of this section if, during the period in which the noncompliance exists, the issuer and the principal user use their
best efforts to correct the noncompliance.
(6) 

Application to employee requirements.

 For purposes of the requirement of section 1397 (b)(6) and (c)(5) that at least 35 percent of the employees are residents
of the empowerment zone or enterprise community, the issuer and each principal user may rely on an employee certification,
signed under penalty of perjury in connection with the hiring of that employee, regarding the residence of the employee
provided_
(i) The employee is made aware of the geographic boundaries of that zone or community;
(ii) The employee is required to notify the employer of a change of residence; and
(iii) Neither the issuer nor the relevant principal user has actual knowledge to the contrary.
(7) 

Application to gross income requirements. 

For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the requirement of section 1397B (b)(2) or (c)(1) continues
to be treated as satisfied for each 5-year period during which, on the average, at least 85 percent of the total gross
income of the enterprise zone business is derived from the active conduct of that business if_
(i) The requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are satisfied; and
(ii) The requirement of section 1397B (b)(2) or (c)(1) is satisfied during each of the first 3 years after the testing
date.
(c) 

Limitation on amount of bonds_

(1) 

Determination of outstanding amount. 

Whether an issue satisfies the requirements of section 1394(c) (relating to the $3 million and $20 million aggregate
limitations on the amount of outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds) is determined as of the issue date of that
issue based on the issue price of that issue and the adjusted issue price of outstanding bonds.

(2) 

Loans-to-lenders programs. 

Whether an issue satisfies the requirements of section 1394(c) may be determined without regard to the amount of bonds
allocable to lenders in a loans-to-lenders program. This paragraph (c)(2) applies only if the proceeds of those bonds
are loaned to an enterprise zone business within 42 months of the issue date of the bonds or, to the extent not so used,
are used to redeem bonds of the issue within that 42 month period. A loans-to-lenders program is a program in which the
issuer of enterprise zone facility bonds, in order to provide loans to enterprise zone businesses, lends the proceeds
of the bonds to a bank or similar intermediary which must then relend the proceeds to enterprise zone businesses.

(d) 

Qualified zone property. 

For purposes of applying the term 

qualified zone property, 

the following rules apply:

(1) 

Original use requirement. 

In general, for purposes of section 1397C(a)(1)(B), 

original use 

means the first use to which the property is put within the empowerment zone, whether or not that use corresponds to
the use of that property by the taxpayer. However, for purposes of section 1394, property that has been abandoned for
a period in excess of one year is treated as satisfying the requirement of section 1397C(a)(1)(B), notwithstanding
that the date of abandonment occurred before the date on which the designation of the empowerment zone took effect.
See, however,  1.103-8(a)(5).





(2) 

Substantially all. 

For purposes of sections 1397B and 1397C(a), 

substantially all 

means 90 percent.

(e) 

Land. 

The determination of whether land is functionally related and subordinate to qualified zone property is made in a
manner consistent with  1.103-8(a)(3).

(f) 

Application of sections 141 through 150_

(1) 

In general. 

Enterprise zone facility bonds are treated as exempt facility bonds that are described in section 142(a). Paragraphs
(f)(2) through (f)(4) of this section provide special rules for applying sections 141 through 150 to enterprise zone
facility bonds. See also paragraph (g)(3) of this section.





(2) 

Maturity limitation_

(i) 

Requirements treated as satisfied. 

The requirements of section 147(b) are treated as satisfied for an issue of enterprise zone facility bonds the proceeds
of which are to be used as part of a loan recycling program if_

(A) Each loan satisfies the requirements of section 147(b) (determined by treating each separate loan as a separate
issue); and


(B) The term of the issue does not exceed 30 years.


(ii) 

Loan recycling program defined. 

A loan recycling program is a program in which_




(A) The issuer reasonably expects as of the issue date of the bonds that loan repayments from principal users will be
used to make additional loans during the portion of the 10-year period following the issue date of the bonds during
which the enterprise community or empowerment zone designation is in effect; and



(B) Repayments of principal on loans (including prepayments) that are received during the period described in paragraph
(f)(2)(i)(A) of this section that are not reasonably expected to be used to make new loans to enterprise zone businesses
and repayments of principal on loans (including prepayments) that are received after that period are used within
6 months of receipt to redeem bonds that are part of the issue.

(3) 

Volume cap.

 For purposes of applying section 146(f)(5) (relating to elective carryforward of unused volume limitation), issuing
enterprise zone facility bonds is a carryforward purpose.
(4) 

Other regulations applicable.

 Regulations under sections 103 and 141 through 150 apply to enterprise zone facility bonds.
(g) 

Continuing compliance and change of use penalties_

(1) 

Termination of designation and cessation due to bankruptcy.

 An enterprise zone facility bond does not cease to be treated as a tax-exempt bond and the penalties described in section
1394(e)(2) do not apply solely by reason of the termination or revocation of a designation as an empowerment zone or
enterprise community or any cessation resulting from bankruptcy.
(2) 

Coordination with good faith compliance provisions.

 Section 1394(e)(2) does not apply during any period in which, under the good faith compliance provisions of paragraph
(b)(3) of this section, the issue is treated as continuing to comply with the requirements of section 1394.
(3) 

Section 150(b)(4) inapplicable.

 Section 150(b0(4) does not apply to enterprise zone facility bonds.
(h) 

Refunding bonds.

 Bonds issued after the termination or revocation of a designation as an empowerment zone or enterprise community
to refund tax-exempt bonds that are enterprise zone facility bonds (other than in an advance refunding) are treated
as tax-exempt bonds if_
(1) The weighted average maturity of the refunding bonds does not exceed the remaining weighted average maturity
of the refunded bonds; and
(2) The amount of the refunding bonds does not exceed the outstanding amount of the refunded bonds.
(i) 

Effective date.

 For effective dates of this section, see  1.141-16.

<USBUREAU>Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement</USBUREAU>





Colorado Regulatory Program


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; reopening and extension of public comment period on proposed amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of additional explanatory information pertaining to a previously proposed amendment
to the Colorado regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Colorado program'') under the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The additional explanatory information pertains to a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) between the Division of Minerals and Geology (DMG) of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and the Water
Quality Control Division (WQCD) of the Colorado Department of Health for water quality management at coal mines.
The amendment is intended to revise the Colorado program to be consistent with SMCRA and the implementing Federal
regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background on the Colorado Program


On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program. General background
information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Colorado program can be found in the December 15, 1980, 

Federal Register

 (45 FR 82173). Subsequent actions concerning Colorado's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 906.11,
906.15, 906.16, and 906.30.

II. Proposed Amendment


By letter dated March 18, 1994, Colorado submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. CO-604). Colorado submitted a proposed MOU in response to a letter dated April 7, 1993 (administrative
record No. CO-539), that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c). The provisions of the MOU that
Colorado proposed to revise pertain to the respective responsibilities of DMG and WQCD regarding coal mining activities
as they impact the hydrologic balance.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the April 7, 1994, 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 16578), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. CO-606). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting,
none was held. The public comment period closed on May 9, 1994.

During its review of the proposed MOU, OSM identified concerns relating to (1) the provisions of item No. 2 of the Enforcement
section of the proposed MOU, which appeared to be contradicted by an August 28, 1990, memorandum of agreement between
WQCD and the Mined Land Reclamation Board (the regulatory board of the Mined Land Reclamation Division that has been
reorganized as DMG) and (2) referenced 2 Code of Colorado Regulations 407.2, Rule 4.05, which does not serve as an adequate
basis for ensuring protection of the hydrologic balance. OSM notified Colorado of the concerns by letter dated June
16, 1994 (administrative record No. CO-627). Colorado responded in a letter dated June 23, 1994, by submitting
additional explanatory information (administrative record No. CO-629).


Based upon the additional explanatory information for the proposed program amendment submitted by Colorado, OSM
reopened the public comment period in the July 29, 1994, 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 38575; administrative record No. CO-637). The public comment period ended on August 15, 1994.
During its review of the additional explanatory information for the proposed MOU, OSM identified concerns relating
to (1) enforcement of effluent standards and the division of responsibility between DMG and WQCD, and (2) standards
for effluent limits. OSM notified Colorado of the concerns by letter dated September 16, 1994 (administrative record
No. CO-646). Colorado responded in a letter dated December 7, 1994, by submitting additional explanatory information
(administrative record No. CO-651).
Colorado proposes additional explanatory information indicating that, because WQCD has primacy for Colorado's
Discharge Permit System program, DMG will enforce Federal, but not State, water quality discharge standards under
the proposed MOU. Colorado has also provided an opinion by the State's attorney general's office that DMG has authority
to enforce the Federal effluent limitation standards at 40 CFR Part 434. Lastly, Colorado also proposes additional
explanatory information indicating that if WQCD approves fundamentally different factors or variances under an
approved National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program, the State will propose to revise the MOU in a proposed
amendment.



III. Public Comment Procedures



OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Colorado program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Colorado
program.

Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the administrative record.


IV. Procedural Determinations


1. Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


2. Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


3. National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.).


5. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated December 7, 1994 (Administrative Record No. IND-1416), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) submitted to OSM a State program amendment package consisting of revisions to the Indiana program rules. The
amendment revises language which was inadvertently repealed and pertains to the procedures for the application
and renewal of blaster certification. The following amendments are being proposed.



1. 310 IAC 12-8-4.1 Application for Certification



This new section is added to provide the following: 

Section 4.1(a) An application for certification as a certified blaster shall be submitted to the department.

(b) An application for certification shall be in writing upon forms furnished by the department.

(c) An application shall be completed in accordance with the instructions provided with it.

(d) An application form is incomplete if the form does not contain all required information or if the form contains
incorrect information. The applicant will be given notice of the deficiencies, and if the required information is
not provided by the applicant within thirty (30) days of the notice, the application will be terminated.

(e) The director or an authorized representative may verify the information shown on the application directly with
educational institutions, other certification boards and personal references, and may verify the work experience

2. 310 IAC 12-8-8.1 Renewal



This new section is added to provide the following:

Section 8.1(a) A certified blaster must obtain renewal of the certification every three (3) years. A request for renewal
of the certification shall be in writing upon a form furnished by the department. The request for renewal must be received
by the department not later than thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the certificate.

(b) The renewal will be approved if the certified blaster has worked at least twelve (12) months of the preceding thirty-six
(36) months as a certified blaster and the certified blaster is not in violation of 310 IAC 12-8-9.

(c) When the certification is not renewed for more than one (1) year after expiration, the certification will not be
renewable. An application shall be submitted to the department in the event that the individual desires to again be
certified, and the individual shall be considered as a new applicant.

(d) A renewal notice will be sent to each registrant not less than two (2) months prior to the expiration date of the certification.

(e) All renewal notices and other communications will be sent to the last address given by the registrant to the department.
A failure of the certified blaster to receive a renewal notice under this subsection does not relieve the certified
blaster of the obligation to obtain a renewal of the certification as required under subsection (a) of this section.

The proposed program amendment submitted by Indiana is available for public inspection at the addresses listed above.
The Director now seeks public comment on whether the proposed amendment is no less effective than the Federal regulations.
If approved, the amendment will become part of the Indiana program.

Written Comments



Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Indianapolis Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the Administrative Record.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4:00 p.m., E.S.T. on January 17, 1995. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission

scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to speak and persons present in the audience who wish to
speak have been heard.

Any disabled individual who has need for a special accommodation to attend a public hearing should contact the individual
listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.





Public Meeting

This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.).



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background on the Oklahoma Program



On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Oklahoma program. General background
information on the Oklahoma program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Oklahoma program can be found in the January 19, 1981, 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 4902). Subsequent actions concerning Oklahoma's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 936.15,
936.16, and 936.30.



II. Proposed Amendment



By letter dated September 14, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. OK-964). Oklahoma submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative with the intention of revising
the Oklahoma program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations.

Oklahoma proposed to revise the Oklahoma Coal Rules and Regulations at Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 460:20-35-3,
eligibility for assistance; OAC 460:20-35-6, program services and data requirements; and OAC 460:20-35-7,
applicant liability.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the September 27, 1994 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 49225), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. OK-964.03). Because no one requested a public hearing or
meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on October 27, 1994.

During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of Oklahoma's rules at OAC
460:20-35-3(a)(2), percentage of ownership and control of the SOAP applicant; OAC 460:20-35-6
(a) and (b), extension of SOAP funding to other program services and requirements for collection of specific kinds
of data; and OAC 460:20-35-7, liability periods. OSM notified Oklahoma of the concerns by letter dated
November 22, 1994 (administrative record No. OK-964.09). Oklahoma responded in a letter dated December 20,
1994, by submitting a revised amendment and additional explanatory information (administrative record No. OK-964.11).

Oklahoma proposes to revise OAC 460:20-35-1, definitions, by adding the requirement that the qualified
laboratory prepare the other services specified at OAC 460:20-35-6; OAC 460:20-35-3(a)(2),
eligibility for assistance, by requiring that attributable production includes, among other things, production
from operations in which the applicant owns more than a 10 percent interest and other operations of persons who own
more than 10 percent of the applicant's operation; OAC 460:20-35-6, program services and data requirements,
by adding the requirement that the program administrator select and pay a qualified laboratory to, in addition to
performing specific services, provide other services for eligible operators who request assistance, and by adding
references to require the collection of specific data and results provided; and OAC 460:20-35-7, applicant
liability, by requiring reimbursement for the cost of SOAP services (1) If the applicant's production exceeds the
allowable tonnage amount during the 12-month period immediately following the issuance of the permit for which assistance
is provided, or, (2) if the permit is sold, transferred, or assigned, the transferee's production exceeds the allowable
tonnage amount during the 12-month period immediately following the issuance of the permit.



III. Public Comment Procedures



OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Oklahoma program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
